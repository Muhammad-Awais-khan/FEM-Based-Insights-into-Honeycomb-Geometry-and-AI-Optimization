However, conventional honeycomb designs often suffer from limited load-bearing capacity, single-stage collapse behavior, and insufficient energy absorption efficiency, making them inadequate for high-performance energy-absorbing systems. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel Framed Diamond-Star Honeycomb (FDSH) structure with a dual-plateau response. The mechanical performance and energy absorption characteristics of the proposed structure were systematically investigated through quasi-static compression experiments and finite element simulations. The effects of key geometric parameters, including cell angles and wall thickness, were also analyzed. The results show that the FDSH structure exhibits a distinct dual-plateau behavior during compression and achieves significant improvements in specific energy absorption—by approximately 238.18% and 161.97%—compared to traditional star-shaped honeycombs (SSH) and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs (REH), respectively. Furthermore, parametric studies confirm that geometric parameters have a significant influence on plateau stability and energy absorption performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Dual-plateau response; Energy absorption; Finite element analysis; Honeycomb structure; Quasi-static compression; Structural optimization","Absorption efficiency; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Rhenium compounds; Shape optimization; Specific energy; Stars; Structural design; Absorption performance; Dual-plateau response; Energy; Energy absorption capability; Finite element analyse; High-strength; Plateau response; Protective systems; Quasi-static compression; Structural optimisations; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization","Zhang, Lujie, Mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio: A review, Engineering Structures, 329, (2025); Pan, Junwei, Aperture size control in kirigami metamaterials: Towards enhanced performance and applications, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 73, (2024); Tan, Xiaojun, Negative stiffness mechanical metamaterials: a review, Smart Materials and Structures, 34, 1, (2025); Wang, Jun, Residual Compressive Strength of Aluminum Honeycomb Sandwich Structures with CFRP Face Sheets after Low-velocity Impact, Applied Composite Materials, 30, 4, pp. 1061-1079, (2023); Pan, Junwei, In-plane dynamics crushing of a reinforced honeycomb with enhanced energy absorption, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 183, (2024); Li, Shicheng, Low-velocity impact response of sandwich plates with corrugation star-shaped honeycomb hybrid core, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 137, (2025); Qin, Shangan, Energy absorption characteristics and negative Poisson's ratio effect of axisymmetric tetrachiral honeycombs under in-plane impact, Composite Structures, 323, (2023); Deng, Yunfei, Experimental and Numerical Study of Composite Honeycomb Sandwich Structures Under Low-Velocity Impact, Applied Composite Materials, 31, 2, pp. 535-559, (2024); An, Dong, Study of the factors influencing load displacement curve of energy absorbing device by area division simulation, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Hu, Qifang, A review on energy absorption performance of auxetic composites with fillings, Thin-Walled Structures, 205, (2024)",""

In our previous work, gradient strategy was implemented in honeycomb structures (HCSs) for enhanced impact resistance, where optimal gradient profiles were determined through a neural network-based machine learning approach. Following the established methodology, this study extends the optimization to graded HCSs of different characteristic heights (defined as H/d, where H is HCS height and d is indenter tip diameter). It was found that for both hexagonal and re-entrant HCSs, the optimal gradient parameters are independent of characteristic height, whereas their energy absorption capacity exhibits linear scaling with height. Through numerical analysis and 3D printing-based experimental validation, this scaling behavior was attributed to the delocalized deformation mechanism, which causes the energy dissipation zone to expand proportionally with increasing structural height. Results presented in this work would provide critical insights for implementing functionally graded HCSs in various energy-absorbing applications, significantly advancing their practical engineering utility. © 2025","Delocalized deformation; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Machine learning","Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Structural design; Structural optimization; Deformation mechanism; Delocalized deformation; Energy; Graded honeycomb; Machine-learning; Network-based; Neural-networks; Performance; Property; Synthetic materials; Impact resistance","Yao, Haimin, Mechanics Underlying the Structure-Property Relations Unveiled From Natural Biomaterials, pp. V8-V8-302, (2023); Marshall, Grayson W., Mechanical properties of the dentinoenamel junction: AFM studies of nanohardness, elastic modulus, and fracture, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, 54, 1, pp. 87-95, (2001); Chen, Poyu, Predation versus protection: Fish teeth and scales evaluated by nanoindentation, Journal of Materials Research, 27, 1, pp. 100-112, (2012); Yao, Haimin, Protection mechanisms of the iron-plated armor of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent gastropod, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 3, pp. 987-992, (2010); Qian, Zhihui, Structure, mechanical properties and surface morphology of the snapping shrimp claw, Journal of Materials Science, 53, 15, pp. 10666-10678, (2018); Gao, Yang, Homogenizing interfacial shear stress via thickness gradient, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 131, pp. 112-124, (2019); Gao, Yang, Homogenizing interfacial shear stress in brick-and-mortar structured composites via gradient modulus for enhanced mechanical properties, Acta Mechanica Sinica/Lixue Xuebao, 40, 6, (2024); Wei, Yujie, Evading the strength-ductility trade-off dilemma in steel through gradient hierarchical nanotwins, Nature Communications, 5, (2014); Gradient Materials: An Overview of a Novel Concept, 88, 5, pp. 358-371; Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1988)",""

The Schwarzite-inspired unit cell is reinforced by introducing a stiffener in its open region, which is further enhanced by incorporating an extruded geometry (referred to as an “extruder”) within the stiffener to maximize energy absorption. Structural optimization is carried out using quasi-static crush analysis, leading to the selection of the optimized unit cell 2 (UC2) for all subsequent studies. The impact resistance of the proposed unit cell is evaluated through bullet impact simulations, targeting pre-selected weak points on a sandwich structure composed of a UC2 core and Aluminum faceplates. This configuration demonstrates resistance to bullet velocities of up to 115 m/s at arbitrary impact locations. Subsequently, the Aluminum faceplates are replaced with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) faceplates featuring various ply orientations. The use of CFRP results in a maximum reduction in bullet penetration depth of 17.81%. Among the different configurations, the [0/90/0/90] cross-ply orientation exhibits the least penetration depth and is therefore recommended. Finally, air blast simulations are conducted on sandwich structures incorporating cores made from UC2, bamboo spiderweb (BS), hierarchical honeycomb (HH), and stiffened honeycomb (SH) designs. Among these, the UC2 core exhibits the highest bending stiffness and the lowest back-face deflection, indicating uniform structural stiffness. Consequently, this design eliminates the need for multi-stage layering or strategic core offsetting. © 2025 The Authors","Blast simulations; Bullet impact; Cellular core; CFRP faceplates; Crush analysis; Sandwich structures; Schwarzites","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Cellular automata; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Stiffness; Structural design; Structural optimization; Uranium compounds; Blast simulation; Bullet impact; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer faceplate; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Cellular core; Cellulars; Crush analysis; Energy; Schwarzites; Unit cells; Sandwich structures","Ambekar, Rushikesh S., Topologically engineered 3D printed architectures with superior mechanical strength, Materials Today, 48, pp. 72-94, (2021); Andraskar, Nikhil D., Impact response of ceramic structures - A review, Ceramics International, 48, 19, pp. 27262-27279, (2022); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Chai, Gin Boay, Low velocity impact response of fibre-metal laminates - A review, Composite Structures, 107, pp. 363-381, (2014); Cui, Xiaodong, Dynamic response of metallic lattice sandwich structures to impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 1-5, (2012); Arch Comput Methods Eng, (2024); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Esnaola, Aritz, Optimization of the semi-hexagonal geometry of a composite crush structure by finite element analysis, Composites Part B: Engineering, 93, pp. 56-66, (2016); From Pure Mathematics to Macroscale Applications the Genesis of Schwarzites, (2024); Feng, Yixiong, Creative design for sandwich structures: A review, International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 17, 3, (2020)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

In this study, a gradient dual-Poisson’s ratio coupling-designed honeycomb (DPCDH) was proposed. The mechanical properties of DPCDH under quasi-static and dynamic crushing conditions were systematically investigated through experimental and numerical methods. The effects of gradient layer number and loading velocity on deformation mode transition and energy absorption efficiency were further clarified. Results demonstrate that the gradient design significantly enhances the crushing performance and energy absorption capacity of DPCDH. Notably, the improvement in energy absorption under quasi-static and low velocity crushing conditions is more substantial than that under high velocity crushing. Specifically, the 3-layers cell number gradient structure (DPCDH-4) achieves a 30.75% increase in energy absorption compared to the uniform structure under quasi-static compression. Additionally, the 2-layers cell number gradient structure (DPCDH-5) exhibits a 36.20% increase under low velocity impact loading.

Results reveal that larger helicoidal angles sacrifice strength and stiffness but promote deformation stability and smoother stress–strain plateaus, while rounded corners (R = 10 mm) effectively improve stress distribution and load-bearing capacity. The optimized configuration (θ = 360°, R = 10 mm) achieves a 184 % improvement in specific energy absorption compared to conventional counterparts. Mechanism analysis demonstrates a unique three-phase deformation process—flexible yielding, stable deformation, and multi-point energy absorption—attributed to the synergistic effect of helicoidal geometry and corner optimization. This work offers new design insights for lightweight, impact-resistant sandwich structures with potential applications in aerospace, protective engineering, and related fields. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Biomimetic design; Compressive performance; Energy absorption; Helicoidal angle; Rounded corner; Sandwich structure","Aerospace applications; Biomimetics; Geometry; Impact resistance; Specific energy; Stress concentration; Structural design; Biomimetic design; Compressive behavior; Compressive performance; Critical challenges; Deformation stability; Energy; Helicoidal angle; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Lightweight structures; Rounded corners; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures","Fan, Meiling, Bending behaviors of 3D printed sandwich structures with functionally graded porous lattice cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 206, (2025); Shi, Shanshan, Impact response of carbon fiber/aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures under multiple low-velocity loads, Composites Science and Technology, 261, (2025); Sharma, Aanchna, Multi-Physically Programmable Tubular Origami Metamaterials: Exploitable Nexus of Geometry, Folding Mechanics and Stimuli-Responsive Physics, Advanced Science, 12, 36, (2025); Li, Xuelin, A novel hybrid star honeycomb with individually adjustable second plateau stresses, Composite Structures, 356, (2025); Fang, Xi, Nonlinear bending of sandwich plates with deep learning inverse-designed 3D auxetic lattice core, Aerospace Science and Technology, 161, (2025); Bozkurt, Ilyas, Effect of geometric configurations and curvature angle of corrugated sandwich structures on impact behavior, Polymer Composites, 46, 2, pp. 1662-1685, (2025); Wang, Shaoqing, Bending performance and failure modes of sinusoidal corrugated sandwich panels fabricated using stereolithography technology: Effects of geometric parameters, Engineering Failure Analysis, 158, (2024); Qu, Yichao, A novel 3D composite auxetic sandwich panel for energy absorption improvement, Engineering Structures, 322, (2025); Ghoddousi, Saman, Compression response of nature-inspired metamaterials based on Fibonacci spiral, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 285, (2025); Ghoddousi, Saman, Effects of foam filling on flexural performance of 3D printed chiral honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 209, (2025)",""

While conventional aluminum honeycomb devices achieve high specific energy absorption, they suffer from complex fabrication, require full replacement after minor impacts, and generate high rebound velocities that can exacerbate secondary damage. In this study, we propose a Multi-layered Nested Tubular Structure (MNTS)—an arrangement of adjustable square and circular thin-walled tubes—as an alternative absorber. A physics–based finite‐element (FE) model, incorporating material nonlinearity, simulates a lead‐car collision against a rigid wall and is validated against full-scale experiments (velocity: 8.357 m/s; mass: 54 t). The model accurately reproduces peak absorbed energy, average force response, displacement history, and rebound velocity. A parametric study of 144 FE simulations combined with response surface methodology identifies optimal wall‐thickness parameters (λ<inf>s</inf> = 7.4 mm, λ<inf>c</inf> = 18.6 mm), yielding a maximum energy absorption of 1.728 MJ (R<inf>MSE</inf> = 0.0477 MJ, R² = 0.945). Building on these results, we develop a reduced‐order analytical model using logistic regression to relate train speed (5.0–9.0 m/s) to peak force, maximum displacement, and energy absorption, achieving an R² of 0.989 for displacement predictions. Validation against 41 additional FE runs confirms the analytical model's accuracy while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Compared with honeycomb absorbers, the MNTS matches energy-absorption efficiency yet significantly lowers peak impact forces and rebound velocities, thereby enhancing passenger safety. Together, the validated FE framework and its streamlined analytical counterpart constitute a rapid, practical design and assessment tool for train collision energy-absorption systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Collision; Energy absorption device; Simplified model; Thin-walled structures; Train","Analytical models; Derailments; Energy absorption; Energy efficiency; Honeycomb structures; Logistic regression; Structural design; Walls (structural partitions); Collision; Energy; Energy absorption device; Multi-layered; Optimization design; Rebound velocity; Simplified model; Thin-walled structures; Train; Tubular structures; Thin walled structures","Chen, Jun, Evaluation of the anti-collision performance of reinforced concrete protective wall for railway bridges under high-speed train impact, Engineering Failure Analysis, 182, (2025); Peng, Yong, Study on the collision performance of a composite energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 94, pp. 663-672, (2015); undefined; undefined, (2018); Qiu, Kunxian, Study on the cutting force in machining of aluminum honeycomb core material, Composite Structures, 164, pp. 58-67, (2017); Chen, Daiheng, Crush Mechanics of Thin-Walled Tubes, pp. 1-325, (2015); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Transition from initial global bending to progressive buckling of tubes loaded statically and dynamically, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 19, 5-6, pp. 415-437, (1997); Li, Yuru, Energy Absorption Characteristics and Parameter Optimization of Anti-Climb Energy-Absorbing Devices for Subway Vehicles under Impact Loads, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2024); Chen, Dongdong, On Crashworthiness and Energy-Absorbing Mechanisms of Thick CFRP Structures for Railway Vehicles, Polymers, 14, 22, (2022); Wang, Dongtao, Crashworthiness performance of gradient energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles under quasi-static loading, Electronic Research Archive, 31, 6, pp. 3568-3593, (2023)",""

However, high porosity leads to low strength, and enhancing strength often compromises NPR, limiting RH's applications. To overcome this, a novel biomimetic arc support enhanced RH (BASERH) is proposed, which markedly improves strength, stiffness, stability, and energy absorption without significantly reducing NPR. Main innovations are listed as follows: First, embedding biomimetic arc supports in RH unit cells to increase plastic hinge coupling deformation, enhancing strength and energy absorption. Second, A theoretical model for plateau stress is developed, enabling preliminary mechanical predictions and reducing the need for extensive simulations or experiments. Third, an optimization method for BASERH parameters is proposed, revealing that arc wall thickness has the most significant influence on strength and energy absorption, followed by the height-to-length ratio, with the width-to-height ratio having the least effect. The plateau stress of BASERH is 10.4 times that of conventional RH. Under axial and radial compression, BASERH tubes exhibit 19.7% and 32.9% higher peak compressive strength, and 32.6% and 38.5% greater specific energy absorption, respectively, compared to conventional RH tubes. BASERH offers a promising design strategy for enhancing RH performance in engineering applications. BASERH can be applied in automotive crash beams, aircraft wings, explosion-proof tires, and canal gate impact panels to provide excellent strength, stiffness, cushioning, and energy absorption performance. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Biomimetic arc support enhanced re-entrant honeycomb; Crushing performance; Energy absorption; Negative Poisson's ratio; Specific energy absorption; Theoretical model","Aircraft accidents; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Wings; Biomimetic arc support enhanced re-entrant honeycomb; Crushing performance; Energy; Mechanical; Mechanical performance; Negative Poisson ratio; Plateau stress; Specific energy absorption; Strength experiments; Theoretical modeling; Energy absorption","Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); An isotropic three-dimensional structure with Poisson's ratio =-1, Journal of Elasticity, 15, 4, pp. 427-430, (1985); Wu, Wenwang, Mechanical design, impact energy absorption and applications of auxetic structures in automobile lightweight engineering, Lixue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 53, 3, pp. 611-638, (2021); Qi, Chang, Quasi-static crushing behavior of novel re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 197, (2020); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic indentation of auxetic and non-auxetic honeycombs under large deformation, Composite Structures, 207, pp. 323-330, (2019); Lakes, Roderic S., Indentability of Conventional and Negative Poisson's Ratio Foams, Journal of Composite Materials, 27, 12, pp. 1193-1202, (1993); Mohsenizadeh, Saeid, Crashworthiness assessment of auxetic foam-filled tube under quasi-static axial loading, Materials and Design, 88, pp. 258-268, (2015); Gao, Yuan, Energy absorption characteristics and optimization of three-beam star honeycomb, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 8, pp. 1559-1573, (2023); Liu, Jiayue, Energy absorption characteristics and stability of novel bionic negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb under oblique compression, Engineering Structures, 267, (2022)",""

This study proposes a novel continuously-graded collapse-oriented honeycomb (CGCOH) by introducing gradient-amplitude sinusoidal profiles into the vertical cell walls of conventional honeycombs. The out-of-plane crushing behavior and energy absorption of the CGCOH are examined experimentally and numerically. Results indicate the deformation mode of CGCOH structure can be effectively regulated by designing amplitude variations, leading to a smooth and stable collapse process. By adjusting the sinusoidal geometry of cell walls, the initial peak force (IPF) can be significantly reduced without compromising, or even slightly improving, the specific energy absorption (SEA). Moreover, a multi-objective crashworthiness optimization based on validated numerical models is conducted to determine the cell wall configuration that yields optimal structural performance. The optimized design achieves a 51.08 % reduction in IPF and a 4.53 % increase in SEA compared to the baseline model. Furthermore, to address the limited load-bearing capacity of individual honeycomb frames, polyurethane (PU) foam was incorporated to enhance energy absorption while preserving lightweight characteristics. Compared to the conventional honeycomb, the optimized CGCOH filled with PU foam exhibits considerable increase in crushing strength and energy absorption capacity due to the synergistic interaction between amplitude-variation sinusoidal cell walls and PU foam filler.

In this study, a novel multi-gradient coupled design method was proposed to enhance the energy absorption capacity of auxetic structures. The star-triangular honeycomb (STH-X) in x-direction was taken as the research object, and the in-plane crushing test was carried out to reveal the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of STH-X with different thickness distributions. The deformation sequence and load-bearing mechanisms of different types of cell walls were investigated, and a theoretical model for the plateau stress of STH-X-D was developed. Subsequently, gradient designs were implemented on different types of cell-walls to obtain a periodic thickness gradient STH-X honeycomb (STH-X-PTG), whose specific energy absorption (SEA) was increased by 58.7 % compared with STH-X with uniform thickness (STH-X-U). Combining traditional gradient, periodic thickness gradient and structural parameter gradient, a multi-gradient coupling design was carried out for STH-X (STH-X-MGCD). Under the in-plane crushing load, the deformation mode of STH-X-MGCD was similar to that of STH-X-U, but the SEA increased by about 85.04 %. Finally, the variables of the multi-gradient coupling design were simplified, and multi-objective optimization design method was employed to optimize the structural parameters of STH-X-MGCD. The optimization result STH-X-OB was improved by 27.22 % and 104.53 % compared with the original structure and STH-X-U, respectively. Compared with the classic auxetic structures (star-shaped, re-entrant structures) and auxetic structures with multi-plateau stress (re-entrant star-shaped, elliptical annular re-entrant structures), the STH-X-MGCD demonstrates excellent energy absorption capacity. Thus, the novel multi-gradient coupling design method provides a new concept for improving the mechanical properties of auxetic structures with multi-plateau stress. © 2025","Auxetic structure; Energy absorption; Multi-gradient coupling design; Multi-objective optimization design; Multi-plateau stress; Negative Poisson's ratio","Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Shape optimization; Stars; Stress analysis; Structural design; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Thickness measurement; Auxetic structures; Coupling designs; Ellipticals; Energy; Gradient coupling; Multi gradient; Multi-gradient coupling design; Multi-objective optimization design; Multi-objectives optimization; Multi-plateau re-entrant star-shaped, elliptical annular re-entrant structure; Negative Poisson ratio; Optimization design; Star-shaped; Energy absorption; bearing capacity; crushing; deformation; loading; mechanical property; optimization; plateau; Poisson ratio","Wang, Weiwei, Design optimization of a novel negative Poisson's ratio non-module battery pack system considering crashworthiness and heat dissipation, Composite Structures, 275, (2021); Wang, Yan, Mechanical Properties of Re-Entrant Hybrid Honeycomb Structures for Morphing Wings, Biomimetics, 9, 9, (2024); He, Qiang, VIBRATION AND DAMPING CHARACTERISTICS OF AUXETIC HONEYCOMB SANDWICH PANELS WITH POLYUREA-METAL LAMINATE FACE SHEETS, Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures, 19, 3, pp. 435-451, (2024); Hu, Qifang, A review on energy absorption performance of auxetic composites with fillings, Thin-Walled Structures, 205, (2024); Zhu, Guohua, Novel multiscale modeling strategy for hybrid fiber reinforced composites, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 287, (2025); Zheng, Yongfeng, Evolutionary topology optimization for mechanical metamaterials with auxetic property, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 179, (2020); Wei, Lulu, Improved mixed gradient design method to enhance compression stiffness and energy absorption of auxetic structures, Composite Structures, 368, (2025); Zhang, Xuegang, A novel auxetic chiral lattice composite: Experimental and numerical study, Composite Structures, 282, (2022); Rogers, Benedict Alexander, Optimization and experimental validation of 3D near-isotropic auxetic structures, Materials and Design, 229, (2023); Wei, Lulu, A novel star-shaped re-entrant circular auxetic honeycomb to enhance in-plane crushing mechanical properties, Engineering Structures, 337, (2025)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

By constructing a polynomial response surface surrogate model, combined with NSGA-II algorithm, the energy absorption, surface average stress and radial deformation of the skeleton are optimized, and the global optimal design is determined by TOPSIS method. Based on the three-layer membrane characteristics of healthy blood vessels, three kinds of honeycomb metamaterials were used as outer, middle and intima skeletons respectively, and seven kinds of PCL-TPU artificial blood vessels with different skeleton thickness ratios were 3D printed.

By combining the topological features of S-shaped- and olive-shaped foldcores, an asymmetric hybrid unit cell design was achieved, which enhanced both the design flexibility and mechanical performance. The specimens were fabricated using a hot press molding process. The effects of the wall thickness and layup configurations of the sandwich cores and thickness distribution of the upper/lower face sheets on the bending performance and failure mechanisms were investigated through three-point bending tests. Finite element simulations were performed in ABAQUS/Explicit, where a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT) based on a three-dimensional continuum damage model was employed to accurately simulate the progressive damage process of the structure under a bending load. Furthermore, the bending performance of the hyperbolic foldcore sandwich structure was compared with that of traditional foldcore and other competing sandwich structures. The results demonstrated that the specific peak load of the novel hyperbolic foldcore sandwich structure was 21.8 % and 21.2 % higher than those of the conventional V-shaped and M-shaped foldcores, respectively. Owing to the asynchronous damage progression resulting from the differing load-bearing capacities of the two sides of the asymmetric unit cell, the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the hyperbolic foldcore was 34.5 % higher than that of the S-shaped foldcore. The bending performance of the hyperbolic foldcore sandwich structure was significantly superior to that of other sandwich structures made of the same material and approached that of the honeycomb core sandwich structures. This study provides new insights and experimental evidence for the design and performance optimization of composite sandwich structures subjected to bending loads. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers.

In this research, an integrated structure enhancing the in-plane strength of Voronoi honeycomb by introducing origami-based folding, named density-graded origami Voronoi honeycomb (DOVH) was developed. Design configurations incorporating three density gradients and four fold angles were fabricated by micro laser powder bed fusion, and their mechanical responses, energy absorption, and crushing behaviors were investigated and validated. It is revealed that the density-graded structures exhibit two hardening stages without densification strain, whereas the non-gradient structures display an apparent plateau and densification stages. A larger fold angle not only enhances the elastic modulus, yield stress, stress after yielding, and energy absorption capacity, but also expands the area of stress concentration and promotes cushioning under blast loading. Meanwhile, a higher density gradient deteriorates the elastic performance and energy absorption due to the lower relative density involved in deformation, as the crushing mode changes from entire collapse to a progressive mode. It also leads to a uniform crushing boundary, maintaining a larger non-deformed region during later deformation, with smaller stress-concentrating regions. The crushing boundary develops in a wave-like morphology, following the fold angle. Additionally, a segmented empirical model was developed to describe the various deformation stages and to evaluate the strengthening effects of fold angle. This research provides design optimization to tailor structural performances for diverse cushioning requirements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Crushing behaviors; Density gradient; Energy absorption; Laser powder bed fusion; Origami; Voronoi honeycombs","Crushing; Honeycomb structures; Stress analysis; Structural design; Structural optimization; Yield stress; Crushing behaviors; Density gradients; Energy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Origami; Powder bed; Tunable energy; Voronoi cell; Voronoi honeycomb; Energy absorption","Siddique, Shakib Hyder, Lessons from nature: 3D printed bio-inspired porous structures for impact energy absorption – A review, Additive Manufacturing, 58, (2022); Sajjad, Uzair, Manufacturing and potential applications of lattice structures in thermal systems: A comprehensive review of recent advances, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 198, (2022); Guo, Zhenkun, Nonlinear dynamic analysis and vibration reduction of two sandwich beams connected by a joint with clearance, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 223, (2025); Hu, Dien, Localized strengthening of triply periodic minimal surface lattice structures via tuning the internal material distribution at the grain level, Additive Manufacturing, 99, (2025); Cui, Zhen, Research on the energy absorption properties of origami-based honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 184, (2023); Ding, Junhao, Imperfection-Enabled Strengthening of Ultra-Lightweight Lattice Materials, Advanced Science, 11, 41, (2024); Ma, Winston Wai Shing, Multi-Physical Lattice Metamaterials Enabled by Additive Manufacturing: Design Principles, Interaction Mechanisms, and Multifunctional Applications, Advanced Science, 12, 8, (2025); Liu, Hui, Hierarchical triply periodic minimal surface shell lattices with superior isotropic elasticity: Design guidelines, fabrication, and validation, Additive Manufacturing, 94, (2024); Luo, Chen, Design, manufacturing and applications of auxetic tubular structures: A review, Thin-Walled Structures, 163, (2021); Berger, Jonathan B., Mechanical metamaterials at the theoretical limit of isotropic elastic stiffness, Nature, 543, 7646, pp. 533-537, (2017)",""

However, most existing designs either provide limited in-plane energy absorption or exhibit multi-stage features only in one loading direction. To address the above-mentioned limitations, this research proposes a novel star-isosceles triangular honeycomb (SITH) structure. It combines the tunability of star-shaped geometries with the stability of triangular frameworks. The mechanical performance of SITH was systematically investigated through quasi-static experiments and numerical simulations. The results show that SITH provides excellent energy absorption in both directions under in-plane biaxial loading. Uniquely, it achieves three plateau stages in the Y direction. A theoretical model was formulated based on the deformation mechanisms that were observed. This model accurately predicts plateau stresses and critical strains. Parametric analyses of the key geometric angles further reveal their influence on the mechanical response. These insights support the optimization of structural performance. Compared with previously reported hybrid honeycombs, the proposed SITH structure demonstrates superior stability, tunable multi-stage energy absorption, and effectiveness in both loading directions. This work establishes a theoretical basis for design of star-shaped hybrid honeycombs. It also offers a promising strategy for impact protection in complex engineering environments. © 2025 The Author(s)","Enhanced energy absorption; Multi-plateau stress; Multi-stage deformation; Reinforced star honeycomb","Elasticity; Energy absorption; Loading; Stars; Stresses; Structural analysis; Structural optimization; Energy; Enhanced energy absorption; Impact protection; Isosceles triangular; Loading direction; Multi-plateau stress; Multi-stage deformation; Multi-stages; Plateau stress; Reinforced star honeycomb; Honeycomb structures","Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Li, Tiantian, Enhancing indentation and impact resistance in auxetic composite materials, Composites Part B: Engineering, 198, (2020); Han, Bin, Honeycomb-corrugation hybrid as a novel sandwich core for significantly enhanced compressive performance, Materials and Design, 93, pp. 271-282, (2016); Al-Dhaheri, Mariam A., Process-induced deformation in U-shaped honeycomb aerospace composite structures, Composite Structures, 248, (2020); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic indentation of auxetic and non-auxetic honeycombs under large deformation, Composite Structures, 207, pp. 323-330, (2019); Jin, Shengguang, Shear resistance of an auxetic chiral mechanical metamaterial, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 174-175, pp. 28-37, (2019); Alderson, Andrew, The in-plane linear elastic constants and out-of-plane bending of 3-coordinated ligament and cylinder-ligament honeycombs, Composites Science and Technology, 70, 7, pp. 1034-1041, (2010); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing response of auxetic honeycombs under large deformation: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, Thin-Walled Structures, 131, pp. 373-384, (2018); Liu, Wangyu, In-plane dynamic crushing of re-entrant auxetic cellular structure, Materials and Design, 100, pp. 84-91, (2016); Wei, Lulu, In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb: Experimental and numerical simulation, Aerospace Science and Technology, 115, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

However, the existing NiTi porous structures typically exhibit stress concentration, which limits their repetitive energy absorption performance.

The gradient NiTi honeycombs with a gradient distribution of Ni content, phase transition behaviour, microstructure and mechanical properties are prepared. The energy absorption and shape recovery properties of gradient NiTi honeycombs under cyclic loading-unloading-heating are investigated. The findings demonstrate that the LPBF-based compositional gradient design method can effectively regulate the local stress distribution and deformation behaviour of the NiTi porous structure without altering its geometrical shape, thereby enhancing its repetitive energy absorption performance. In addition, a Ni evaporation prediction model has been developed to elucidate the controlling mechanism of process parameters on Ni evaporation in the melt pool. Furthermore, the influence mechanism of gradient distribution on the stress distribution and deformation behavior of NiTi honeycombs is explored.

These models are constructed to predict specific energy absorption (SEA), effective Young's modulus (EYM), plateau stress (PS) and stress-strain curves based on six simple geometric parameters (four internal concave angles, overall size of the unit cell and in-plane thickness). The predictive accuracy of these models is evaluated through a combination of experimental measurements and finite element simulations. Our results reveal that the optimal non-parametric ML models (LightGBM models) achieve high predictive accuracy for the SEA with R2 = 0.983, EYM with R2 = 0.854 and PS with R2 = 0.969, and the internal angular features are confirmed to dominate these mechanical indicators by feature importance evaluation. Moreover, the parametric models derived using the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) also yield considerable predictive accuracy for these mechanical indicators with R2 = 0.65 for SEA, R2 = 0.67 for EYM and R2 = 0.82 for PS. The dominant influence of the re-entrant angle is further confirmed on these mechanical indicators based on the derived parametric model. Furthermore, the full-field stress–strain responses of re-entrant honeycomb metamaterials are predicted by the ML model constructed using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based on simple geometric parameters. Finally, the validity of these models is confirmed through experimental measurements and finite element simulations. Our work not only eliminates the need for experimental trial-and-error and manual parameter tuning, but also provides a generalizable framework for the design and evaluation of mechanical properties in metamaterials. The proposed framework can also be applied to three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials to support performance prediction and geometric configuration design. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Effective Young's modulus; Machine learning; Mechanical metamaterials; Plateau stress; Re-entrant honeycombs; Specific energy absorption","Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Learning systems; Machine learning; Metamaterials; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Stress-strain curves; Effective young's modulus; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Plateau stress; Predictive accuracy; Property; Re-entrant honeycomb; Specific energy absorption; Elastic moduli","Li, Xiang, Auxetic mechanical metamaterials: from soft to stiff, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, 5, 4, (2023); Liu, Yong, Disordered mechanical metamaterials with programmable properties, Acta Materialia, 285, (2025); Jiao, Pengcheng, Mechanical metamaterials and beyond, Nature Communications, 14, 1, (2023); Li, Fangyi, A new three-dimensional re-entrant negative Poisson's ratio metamaterial with tunable stiffness, Engineering Structures, 306, (2024); Pan, Yi, A novel 3D polygonal double-negative mechanical metamaterial with negative stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio, Composite Structures, 331, (2024); Zhang, Hongbo, Excellent mechanical properties of a novel double-diagonal reinforced mechanical metamaterial with tunable Poisson's ratios inspired by deep-sea glass sponges, Materials and Design, 250, (2025); Zhang, Lujie, Mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio: A review, Engineering Structures, 329, (2025); Gao, Yuan, Programmable mechanical metamaterials with tunable Poisson's ratio and morphable stiffness, Composites Part B: Engineering, 292, (2025); Zhang, Qiao, A series of metamaterials exhibiting negative thermal expansion inspired by leaflet pattern in compound leaf, Composite Structures, 356, (2025); Noda, Masaki, Quasi-isotropic metamaterials with negative thermal expansion designed via topology optimization using topological derivative, Composite Structures, 365, (2025)",""

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a negative Poisson's ratio metamaterial filled structure based on topology optimization. Firstly, a functional cell element topology optimization method is proposed, and the effects of complex parameters on the optimization results are considered. 50 optimization results are obtained by using design of experiments. Subsequently, the optimal structure with the higher specific energy absorption and the more stable deformation mode is determined by selective laser melting and simulation; finally, the optimal structure is applied to the energy absorber, and six kinds of working conditions, including centricity, wide range of offset, and angle, are designed on the basis of considering the complex and uncertain boundary conditions. The results show that the proposed lateral compressed negative Poisson's ratio structure has a more stable deformation pattern and lower initial collision force than the conventional axially compressed hexagonal honeycomb-filled structure, and the degree of bending is significantly less than that of the conventional structure under complex boundary conditions. It is worth pointing out that, due to the extensive bending of the hexagonal honeycomb-filled absorber, the specific energy absorption of the proposed lateral compression absorber is instead higher by about 10.8%, while the degradation rate of the specific energy absorption is lower in the case of offset and angular collisions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-climbing energy absorber; Complex boundary conditions; Metamaterials; Negative Poisson's ratio; Topology optimization","Bending (deformation); Degradation; Design of experiments; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Topology; Anti-climbing energy absorber; Complex boundary condition; Condition; Deformation pattern; Energy absorbers; Hexagonal honeycomb; Negative Poisson ratio; Optimisations; Specific energy absorption; Topology optimisation; Boundary conditions; Metamaterials","Andreassen, Erik, Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 43, 1, pp. 1-16, (2011); Baroutaji, Ahmad, On the crashworthiness performance of thin-walled energy absorbers: Recent advances and future developments, Thin-Walled Structures, 118, pp. 137-163, (2017); undefined, (2010); Chen, Chunyang, Exploration of key traction-running equipment and its problems on heavy-haul trains and research on technology development, Transportation Safety and Environment, 2, 3, pp. 161-182, (2020); Gao, Qiang, An analytical model of cylindrical double-arrowed honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 173, (2020); Guan, Weiyuan, Crashworthiness performance and multiobjective optimization of a combined splitting circular tube energy absorber under eccentric impact for subway vehicles, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 158, (2021); Guedes, José Miranda, Preprocessing and postprocessing for materials based on the homogenization method with adaptive finite element methods, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 83, 2, pp. 143-198, (1990); Guo, Feng, Dynamic response analysis of three-dimensional U-shaped negative Poisson's ratio periodic structures, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 111, (2025); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Morin, Xavier, Managerial Challenges in Implementing European Rail Traffic Management System, Remote Train Control, and Automatic Train Operation: A Literature Review, Future Transportation, 4, 4, pp. 1350-1369, (2024)",""

Despite extensive research on origami, its use in cellular lattices remains limited, as standalone origami tubes often exhibit buckling and reduced mechanical properties, limiting their energy absorption. This study addresses these issues by proposing hierarchical origami-inspired planar-based lattices (OIPLs) that inherently fulfil design for manufacturability (DFM) requirements through the use of interpenetrating curved crease origami tubes. These structures enhance specific energy absorption (SEA) at low relative densities, making them ideal for lightweight aerospace applications. Arranging the primary origami tube into three distinct tessellations created hierarchical lattices with ordered voids featuring 4, 6, and 8 corners, resulting in lattices named Rhomboid (RB), Hexavoid (HV), and Octavoid (OV), respectively. These hierarchical lattices were fabricated using material extrusion additive manufacturing techniques at a 15 % relative density (RD) and tested under quasi-static compression, with a honeycomb (HC) lattice serving as a benchmark. Although the HV lattice showed a 6 % lower SEA and a 23 % lower modulus compared to HC, it exhibited stable plateau stresses and reduced peak stress, both essential for energy absorption. Among the OIPLs, HV achieved the highest performance, with a 28 % increase in SEA and a 9 % increase in modulus. Further analysis of HV revealed that lower top-edge angles (α) and higher RDs improved buckling resistance, while increased angles and RDs yielded SEA values up to 19 J/g, approximately 82 % higher than those obtained using origami tubes. Additionally, reducing the RB unit cell size at 15 % RD resulted in a 24 % SEA improvement over HC, while the HV lattice with more unit cells (N = 4) at the same RD demonstrated a 35 % SEA enhancement over HC. © 2025 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Cellular lattices; Energy absorption; Origami","Additives; Aerospace applications; Buckling; Cellular manufacturing; Design for manufacturability; Honeycomb structures; Machine design; Structural design; Cellular lattices; Design optimization; Energy; Hierarchical lattice; Mechanical; Origami; Property; Relative density; Robotics applications; Specific energy absorption; Energy absorption","Zhai, Zirui, Origami-inspired, on-demand deployable and collapsible mechanical metamaterials with tunable stiffness, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 115, 9, pp. 2032-2037, (2018); Misseroni, Diego, Origami engineering, Nature Reviews Methods Primers, 4, 1, (2024); Feng, Yongjie, A simplified mechanical model of the crease in the flexible origami structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 241, (2022); Huang, Kai, Complex SiOC ceramics from 2D structures by 3D printing and origami, Additive Manufacturing, 33, (2020); Ha, Ngoc-san, Energy absorption of a bio-inspired cylindrical sandwich structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 195, (2024); Xiao, Liping, Folding of sealed origami-inspired capsule with rigid panels and hyperelastic hinges, Thin-Walled Structures, 190, (2023); Yang, Mengzhu, Volume Optimisation of Multi-stable Origami Bellows for Deployable Space Habitats, Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, 36, 4, pp. 514-530, (2023); Yang, Chengxing, Fatigue failure analysis of platform screen doors under subway aerodynamic loads using finite element modeling, Engineering Failure Analysis, 174, (2025); Xu, Ping, Crashworthiness analysis and multi-objective optimization of a novel metal/CFRP hybrid friction structures, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 67, 6, (2024); Choi, Hana, Fabrication of Origami Soft Gripper Using On-Fabric 3D Printing, Robotics, 12, 6, (2023)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

In this paper, several auxetic honeycomb structures, including re-entrant auxetic, anti-tetrahedral chiral, hexachiral, anti-tri chiral, and double arrowhead, are optimized, and their weight distribution is the main emphasis of this work. The study employs four meta-heuristic optimization algorithms: Multiverse Optimizer (MVO), inspired by black holes and wormholes; Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), based on mathematical operators; Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), using sine and cosine functions; and Flow Direction Algorithm (FDA), simulating water flow to find optimal solutions. Utilizing optimization approaches, various geometric properties of cells like angles, wall thickness, and ligament lengths have been optimized to minimize negative Poisson's ratio and enhance structural efficiency. The analysis reveals that structural geometry significantly influences weight distribution, with configurations like anti-tetrahedral chiral achieving low mass through efficient material usage, while re-entrant and double arrowhead structures balance weight and performance due to reduced hollow spaces. These findings highlight the critical role of geometric optimization in tailoring auxetic structures for lightweight, high-strength applications across engineering and materials science domains. FDA demonstrated superior optimization performance, achieving the most negative Poisson's ratio, with MVO delivering comparable results.

The relevant finite element model is constructed using Abaqus/Explicit and validated against quasistatic compression experiments. A comparative analysis is initially conducted on the in-plane performance of ACECH structures with varying concave angles. The results show that increasing the concave angle significantly enhances the specific energy absorption (SEA): ACECH-80° exhibits a 17.83% improvement over ACECH-60°, while ACECH-90° shows a 36.31% enhancement. Further investigations are carried out to assess the effect of the circular node diameter R on the mechanical properties of ACECH-80° and ACECH-90°. The SEA of ACECH-80°-R16 increases by 36.22% compared to R6, while ACECH-90°-R10 shows a 26.64% increase relative to R6. These findings indicate that increasing the circular node diameter significantly improves energy absorption in ACECH-80°, but yields diminishing returns in ACECH-90°.

However, traditional manufacturing techniques, like mold pressing and hot-press molding, entail multiple stages, require intricate tooling, and incur high costs, constraining the designs of advanced sandwich structures. This study aims to develop a novel manufacturing technique that facilitates the integration of microcellular foam cores and continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composite panels or reinforcements for sandwich structures. First, integrating in-situ microcellular foaming and CFRPC with additive manufacturing facilitates the efficient and effective production of sandwich structures with complex designs. Then, the design incorporated three scales: macroscopic sandwich structures, unit-cells, and microcellular. Subsequently, various unit-cell configurations (honeycomb, square, rhombus, and re-entrant honeycomb) were manufactured, and compressive properties were evaluated through experimentation. Finally, the study revealed the effect of temperature on foam density and compression modulus, finding that 230 °C optimizes foam expansion, improving properties. A 10 mm rhombus unit-cell structure exhibited the highest compression modulus (40.38 MPa) and specific energy absorption (59.02 mJ·m3/kg), making it the optimal choice for load-bearing applications. Lattice-web reinforcements within the foam core significantly enhance compressive strength and energy absorption. The findings suggest that the proposed multiscale design and production methodologies facilitate the development of innovative and high-performance multiscale sandwich structures and reinforcements, which are unattainable through conventional techniques. These structures have potential applications in the aerospace and automotive industries, where lightweight, energy-absorbing materials are crucial.

The configuration was engineered to achieve superior multi-criteria crashworthiness performance compared to Conventional Honeycomb Core (CHC) through tunable morphological design. The energy absorption mechanism of HMCs was theoretically modeled through a discretization method employing Typical Angle Elements (TAEs), with theoretical predictions rigorously validated against Finite Element (FE) simulation results demonstrate predictive accuracy within 5% error tolerance, and the FE model was validated by quasi-static compression tests using a HMC specimen, demonstrating strong agreement between simulation and experiment. Comparative analysis at t = 0.10 mm revealed that HMCs within 30∘≤ θ ≤ 60∘ exhibited superior multi-criteria crashworthiness compared to CHC, demonstrating 7.7% to 16.3% Peak Crush Force (PCF) reduction with concomitant improvements of 6.8% to 8.2% in Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and 13.2% to 15.1% in Crush Force Efficiency (CFE). The θ = 45∘ configuration was identified as a Pareto-optimal design with balanced crashworthiness criteria (PCF: 17.66 kN, SEA: 23.05 kJ/kg, CFE: 0.25), achieving a 197% higher comprehensive crashworthiness criterion γ than CHC. A multi-objective optimization framework integrating polynomial surrogate models (quadratic for PCF, cubic for SEA/CFE) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) identified optimal configurations across four optimization scenarios. Case-4 optimization yielded an optimal solution at θ = 44.49∘ and t = 0.10 mm (PCF: 18.439 kN, SEA: 22.993 kJ/kg, CFE: 0.268).

To enhance the impact performance of the specimens, they were coated with a carbon nanotubes (CNT) reinforced epoxy matrix nanocomposite and the tests were repeated. The experiments were conducted in a laboratory environment at room temperature with energy values of 5 J, 10 J and 15 J using the drop tower test device. The damage mechanism in the structures were analyzed through numerical graphics obtained from the contact force–time, contact force–displacement and energy–time graphs. With CNT reinforcement, maximum displacement values improved by 10–29%, while an increase in cell height resulted in improvements of 19–33%. The maximum force increased by up to 61% in the 5 J and 15 J tests of both thin and thick specimens. The experiments were conducted to determine the effect of cell height on impact behavior, as well as the effectiveness of CNT reinforcement on impact damage reduction. CNT reinforcement led to a strength increase of up to 60%, which allowed for a reduction in cell height and therefore the wing/body thickness. It was also revealed that the inclusion of CNT reinforcement effectively reduced the damage to both the top plate and the honeycomb structure of the specimen. Severe damage modes such as upper plate fracture and cell crushing were significantly mitigated, while only matrix damage—considered tolerable and capable of preserving the integrity of the main structure—was observed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University 2025.","Aircraft materials; Carbon nano tube; Low velocity impact; Nomex honeycomb","","Abd Kadir, Nur Amanina, Experimental study of low-velocity impact on foam-filled Kraft paper honeycomb structure, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 290, 1, (2018); Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); J Eng Res, (2024); Aly, Karim, Real-time impact damage sensing and localization in composites through embedded aligned carbon nanotube sheets, Composites Part B: Engineering, 162, pp. 522-531, (2019); Aly, Karim, Strain sensing in composites using aligned carbon nanotube sheets embedded in the interlaminar region, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 90, pp. 536-548, (2016); Aly, Karim, In-situ monitoring of woven glass fiber reinforced composites under flexural loading through embedded aligned carbon nanotube sheets, Journal of Composite Materials, 52, 20, pp. 2777-2788, (2018); Aly, Karim, One-step fabrication of bulk nanocomposites reinforced by carbon nanotube array fragments, Polymer Composites, 43, 1, pp. 94-110, (2022); Subramani, Anbazhagan, Quasi-static indentation characteristics of sandwich composites with hybrid facesheets: Experimental and numerical approach, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 1, pp. 294-320, (2022); Arezoo, S., Compressive deformation of Rohacell foams: Effects of strain rate and temperature, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 51, pp. 50-57, (2013); Sens Technol, (2024)",""

Body-centered-cubic, gyroid, and honeycomb lattice architectures are fabricated using laser powder bed fusion with A286 superalloy and subjected to split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) testing at impact pressures ranging from 2 to 6 bar. Experimental data are extracted for peak stress, max strain, max strain rate, and energy absorbed and structured into a multioutput supervised learning dataset. Four regression models (linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, and a fully connected neural network) are trained and compared. The neural network achieves the highest predictive performance with R2 values of 0.9859, 0.9884, 0.9673, and 0.9815 for PeakStress, MaxStrain, MaxStrainRate, and EnergyAbsorbed, respectively, and corresponding root mean squared errors of 7.58 MPa, 0.0121, 131.59 s−1, and 1.59 J. Shapley additive explanation-based interpretability analysis reveals that Pressure_Bar is the most influential predictor for MaxStrainRate, while Lattice_Type dominates the prediction of PeakStress and EnergyAbsorbed. Parity plots and error histograms confirm model fidelity, with the majority of predictions within ±5% of experimental values. The developed ML framework demonstrates strong generalization and offers a data-driven alternative to traditional SHPB experiments for performance evaluation of architected materials. This methodology provides a foundation for rapid surrogate modeling, material screening, and AI-assisted design optimization in high-strain-rate applications, with future potential for integration into physics-informed ML systems. © 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","additive manufacturing; energy absorption; high strain rate; lattice structures; machine learning; multioutput neural networks; split Hopkinson pressure bar","Additives; Bridge decks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Support vector regression; Energy; High-strain-rate; Lattice structures; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Multi-output; Multioutput neural network; Neural-networks; Rate response; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Energy absorption; Strain rate","J Mech Sci Technol, (2025); Siva Reddy, Bobbili Veera, Performance Evaluation of Metallic Honeycomb and Gyroid Micro-lattice Structures for Armoured Fighting Vehicles, Transactions of the Indian Institute of Metals, 77, 3, pp. 615-626, (2024); Shaik, Ameer Malik, Investigation of additive manufactured micro-lattice structures for defence applications, Materials Science-Poland, 41, 2, pp. 383-400, (2023); Song, Weidong, Dynamic mechanical behaviors and deformation mechanism of hybrid triply periodic minimal surface structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 203, (2025); Xiao, Lijun, Experimental study on the fracture behavior of 3D printed interpenetrating phase composites with triply periodic minimal surface architectures, Thin-Walled Structures, 208, (2025); Li, Xue, Compressive behavior of selective laser melting printed Gyroid structures under dynamic loading, Additive Manufacturing, 46, (2021); Saremian, Reza, Experimental and numerical investigation on lattice structures fabricated by selective laser melting process under quasi-static and dynamic loadings, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 112, 9-10, pp. 2815-2836, (2021); Cao, Xiaofei, Dynamic compressive behavior of a modified additively manufactured rhombic dodecahedron 316L stainless steel lattice structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); J Dyn Behav Mater, (2022); Prog Addit Manuf, (2024)",""

This study introduced the corrugated cell walls into self-similar honeycombs, proposing a novel design with dual-scale optimization at both cell-wall and global structural levels. Honeycombs were fabricated from toughened polylactic acid using fused deposition modeling (FDM). Numerical simulation elucidated the mechanisms behind the enhanced energy absorption of these structures. In self-similar designs, inner/outer wall connections promoted folded lobe formation, enabling extensive material participation in plastic deformation. The self-similar honeycombs exhibited a 93.06 % higher specific energy absorption (SEA) compared to regular hexagonal honeycombs (RH). Optimizing conventional walls to corrugated configurations further enhanced performance, achieving a 128.44 % increase in SEA over RH. Increased wave number (N) and amplitude reduced folding lobes, eventually triggering global buckling. The optimal configuration, featuring single-wave geometry (N = 1) with a 0.6 mm amplitude, demonstrated superior energy absorption characteristics. Parametric analysis indicated that thicker cell walls elevated both mean crushing force (MCF) and SEA.

However, such approaches inevitably increase the complexity of the unit cell structure. This study innovatively modifies traditional hexagonal honeycombs through an offset configuration. The introduction of this offset design not only avoids increasing the complexity of the unit cell but also enhances crashworthiness by increasing the number of connecting hinges. The performance of the proposed structures was investigated through both experimental testing and numerical simulations. A validated finite element model was then utilized to examine the influence of offset distance and relative density on structural performance. Additionally, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was applied to optimize the structural designs and identify the configuration with the best overall performance. The results demonstrate that, under both identical wall thickness and identical relative density conditions, the crashworthiness of the symmetrically offset hexagonal honeycomb (SOHH) and asymmetrically offset hexagonal honeycomb (AOHH) proposed in this study surpasses that of traditional hexagonal honeycombs. When comparing structures with identical wall thickness, the conventional hexagonal honeycomb (SHH) demonstrates significantly inferior performance to AOHH, with its EA, SEA, MCF, and CFE reaching only approximately 50 %-60 % of AOHH's corresponding values. Furthermore, the offset distance and relative density significantly affect structural performance. When the wall thickness remains constant, the difference between the best and worst performance metrics due to varying offset distances exceeds 50 %. As the relative density increases, the average improvements in EA, SEA, MCF, and PCF for SOHH and AOHH exceed 75 %, while the average increase in CFE surpasses 23 %. The study reveals that SOHH and AOHH exhibit substantial performance enhancements compared to traditional structures. Therefore, the introduction of offset configurations provides a novel design approach for honeycomb structures, offering a promising direction for future research and applications in impact-resistant engineering. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structure; Multi-objective optimization; Offset design; TOPSIS method","Model structures; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Energy; Hexagonal honeycomb; Multi-objectives optimization; Offset design; Relative density; Solution methods; Structural performance; Technique for order preference by similarities to ideal solutions; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method; Honeycomb structures","Wang, Bin, Mushrooming of circular tubes under dynamic axial loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 40, 2, pp. 167-182, (2002); Liu, Yucheng, Bending collapse of thin-walled circular tubes and computational application, Thin-Walled Structures, 46, 4, pp. 442-450, (2008); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Non-linear finite element analysis of bitubal circular tubes for progressive and bending collapses, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 99, pp. 228-236, (2015); Ghoddousi, Saman, Compression response of nature-inspired metamaterials based on Fibonacci spiral, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 285, (2025); Alavi, Ali, Comparative analysis of energy absorption capacity of simple and multi-cell thin-walled tubes with triangular, square, hexagonal and octagonal sections, Thin-Walled Structures, 74, pp. 155-165, (2014); Karagiozova, Dora, Energy absorption of aluminium alloy circular and square tubes under an axial explosive load, Thin-Walled Structures, 43, 6, pp. 956-982, (2005); Bambach, Mike R., Static and dynamic axial crushing of spot-welded thin-walled composite steel-CFRP square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 9, pp. 1083-1094, (2009); Zhang, Xiong, Energy absorption of longitudinally grooved square tubes under axial compression, Thin-Walled Structures, 47, 12, pp. 1469-1477, (2009); Lv, Xiaojiang, On safety design of vehicle for protection of vulnerable road users: A review, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Xu, Shen, Design and study of the crashworthiness of two-way gradient topology star-shaped honeycombs, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, (2025)",""

Inspired by natural materials, we propose a type of honeycomb arch beams (HAB) structure to achieve exceptional energy absorption performances under transverse bending loads. HABs with different cell shapes are first analyzed numerically using the finite element software LS-DYNA, followed by comparative analysis of their performance. Results demonstrate that rectangular honeycomb arch beams (RHABs) exhibit ideal energy-absorbing characteristics. Parametric studies are then carried out to investigate the effects of cell numbers (Circumferential: 15 ≤ A ≤ 120, Radial: 3 ≤ B ≤ 7), wall thickness (0.5 mm ≤ t ≤ 2.5 mm), span (240 mm ≤ S ≤ 400 mm), arch height (40 mm ≤ S ≤ 100 mm) and cross-sectional dimensions (30 mm ≤ Height H ≤ 50 mm, 20 mm≤ Width W ≤ 40 mm) on the crashworthiness of RHABs. Based on the method of dimensional analysis, theoretical expression for the plateau force of RHABs is derived. The accuracy of the theoretical expression is validated against numerical simulations with a maximum error of 11.0 % and most errors below 3 %.

This study aims to enhance the strength-to-weight ratio, also known as specific strength, a crucial parameter in the design and optimization of structures. The innovations of this work are the fabrication of a three-layer composite structure, with two composite layers of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) by vacuum pump and a mesh core made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) materials by fused deposition modeling (FDM) (3D printer). The other innovations, including compression, three types of cores (tubular, honeycomb, and truss), are used to consider the effect of the geometric shape of the printed core, as well as two different thicknesses of the sheet layers on the honeycomb core. The samples are manufactured by ASTM standards, undergoing tensile, three-point bending, buckling, and vibration tests. To verify the experimental results, the behavior of the samples under bending, buckling, and vibration has been obtained numerically. The equations of motion based on Hamilton’s principle and the equations of equilibrium using the minimum potential energy method have derived based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. Subsequently, the deformation due to bending, critical buckling load, and natural frequency of the three-layer composite sandwich structure has been calculated using the Navier’s method. Theoretical, experimental, and numerical (Abaqus) analyses validate the buckling and the vibration responses. Three-point bending tests further evaluate mechanical behavior. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the tubular core, due to its symmetrical geometric structure and absence of stress concentration points, performs more effectively against the applied loads induced by the test, including tensile, bending, and compressive loads. The critical buckling load and the ultimate failure force due to the bending load of the tubular core have increased by 1.84 and 1.98 times compared to the honeycomb core, respectively. Also, this core has enhanced the critical buckling load and the ultimate failure force by 1.15 and 1.14 times compared to the truss core, respectively. In addition, the honeycomb structure, because better stress distribution and displacement caused by bending loads within the cells, leads to increase the energy absorbed in the structure by 7% and 71.9% compared to tubular and truss cores, respectively. Among the innovations of this work are the construction and the investigation of the structural mass. Increasing the thickness of the composite layer in the honeycomb core while slightly increasing the structure’s mass has significantly improved its behavior. Notably, increasing face sheet thickness in honeycomb cores significantly enhances structural performance, improving braking force and specific energy absorption by 73% and 24%, respectively. In addition, one of the novelties of this work is the incorporation of a lightweight and compact core, which creates a structure that significantly reduces the final price while increasing bending stiffness and, consequently, the moment of inertia. Considering the unique characteristics of the structures, including high specific strength, they can be widely used in the wind turbine industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Buckling and vibration tests; FDM using PLA and ABS materials; Honeycomb; Sandwich structures; Tensile and three-point bending tests; Truss cores; Tubular","","Cui, Youjiang, Structure failure and strength evaluation of honeycomb-based sandwich composites under variable hydro-thermal-mechanical load, Composite Structures, 354, (2025); Asgari, Mohsen, Static Bending, Vibration, and Buckling Responses of a Sandwich Beam Composed of Five Layers Considering Honeycomb Core and CNTRC with SMA Particles and Temperature-Dependent Material Properties Using SSDT, Mechanics of Advanced Composite Structures, 12, 1, pp. 153-168, (2025); Hajighasemi, Mohammad Reza, Design and Manufacture of a Smart Macro-Structure with Changeable Effective Stiffness, International Journal of Applied Mechanics, 12, 1, (2020); Fatahi, Mohammad Hossein, Experimental and numerical implementation of auxetic substrate for enhancing voltage of piezoelectric sandwich beam harvester, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 27, pp. 6107-6117, (2022); Selvarajan, L., Review on characterization, impacts and optimization of EDM parameters on composite structure in additive manufacturing, Progress in Additive Manufacturing, 10, 8, pp. 4573-4624, (2025); Sahu, Dhaneshwar Prasad, Frequency analysis of skew sandwich plates with polyethylene terephthalate foam-core and carbon/basalt fiber-reinforced hybrid face layers using ANFIS model and experimental validation, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, (2024); Sahu, Dhaneshwar Prasad, Flexural and dynamic characterization of carbon/basalt hybrid laminated composite sandwich plates with PET foam core: A numerical and experimental approach, Structures, 72, (2025); Ghoddousi, Saman, Compression response of nature-inspired metamaterials based on Fibonacci spiral, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 285, (2025); Zahed, Mahdi, Reinforcement of 3D-Printed Re-Entrant Structures using Additional Supports under Three-Point Bending, Experimental and Numerical Analyses, Advanced Engineering Materials, 26, 1, (2024); Bargozini, Fatemeh, Buckling of a sandwich beam with carbon nano rod reinforced composite and porous core under axially variable forces by considering general strain, Results in Engineering, 21, (2024)",""

The structural performance of these plates is significantly influenced by the core's design. This study uses an integrated methodology combining numerical analysis with targeted experimental validation through an alternative dynamic method to explore vibration, bending, and buckling behavior of sandwich plates with novel bio-inspired cores. Using first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) to model shear effects accurately, five distinct core designs were created, inspired by the pomelo peel's cellular structure. These designs provide better stiffness-to-weight ratios and energy absorption than conventional honeycomb or foam cores, typically studied with classical plate theories. Facesheets were made from GFRP using the hand layup process, and cores were 3D printed using PLA. Finite element numerical simulations assessed natural frequencies, deflections, and critical buckling loads under various boundary conditions. Experimental vibration analysis focused on dynamic performance with an alternative dynamic method, aligning modal frequencies with simulations and showing good agreement. Among designs, PIM02 performed best dynamically due to its optimized cellular geometry, while PIM01 stood out in bending and buckling, making PIM02 the top choice under test conditions. This bio-inspired approach, guided by FSDT, improves sandwich structures for lightweight, high-performance use, offering a fresh method that beats traditional designs in versatility and strength. Highlights: Novel bio-inspired sandwich plate cores inspired by pomelo peel were studied. Five core designs analyzed for vibration, bending, and buckling behavior.

This was accomplished by analyzing three printing parameters, infill pattern structure, infill density, and layer height, each of which changed across four levels. The specimens' structural performance was then assessed using quasi-static axial compression testing. In addition to carefully documenting failure histories, data on crash load, absorbed energy, and displacement responses were methodically recorded during the testing. Several critical performance measures, including the initial peak crash load ((Formula presented.)), the total energy absorbed (U), the mean crash load ((Formula presented.)), the specific absorbed energy (SEA), and the crash force efficiency (CFE), were used to evaluate crashworthiness. A complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method, was employed to determine the optimal configuration. The results indicate that the honeycomb structure achieves the highest values for (Formula presented.), U, (Formula presented.), and SEA, with measurements of 5.57 kN, 250.54 J, 4.64 kN, and 15.27 J/g, respectively. Meanwhile, the Schwarz P attains the maximum CFE, with a value of 1.585. The COPRAS results further indicated that the HC-30-0.20 configuration exhibited the best crashworthiness performance. Highlights: The designed configurations were created using FDM. The tubes were exposed to axial compression loads. The crashing load and energy absorption curves against displacement were computed. Besides, the crashing histories were detected.

Inspired by natural hierarchical materials, the design incorporates hollow circular substructures to replace solid honeycomb ribs, optimizing both mechanical performance and energy absorption. Experimental and finite element simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of substructure number and rib configuration on structural properties while maintaining a constant mass. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical square honeycomb structure (SHH-C332) exhibits a 127% increase in strength, a 63.94% higher elastic modulus, and an 82.27% improvement in energy absorption compared to the classic square honeycomb structure (SH-C330). Additionally, the study reveals that the load-bearing capacity is maximized when the number of circular substructures (N) is ≤2, while excessive substructures (N > 2) lead to stress concentration and reduced performance. The hierarchical design also shows tunable mechanical properties by adjusting geometric parameters, making it adaptable for precise engineering requirements. These findings highlight the potential of biomimetic hierarchical structures in developing sustainable, lightweight, and high-performance materials for applications in aerospace, automotive, and construction industries.

This review systematically explores bio-inspired cellular structures as promising solutions for improving the impact resistance of EV battery packs. Inspired by natural geometries, these designs exhibit superior energy absorption, controlled deformation behavior, and high structural efficiency compared to conventional configurations. A comprehensive analysis of experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies published up to mid-2025 was conducted, with emphasis on design strategies, optimization techniques, and performance under diverse loading conditions. Findings show that auxetic, honeycomb, and hierarchical multi-cell architectures can markedly enhance specific energy absorption and deformation control, with improvements often exceeding 100% over traditional structures. Finite element analyses highlight their ability to achieve controlled deformation and efficient energy dissipation, while optimization strategies, including machine learning, genetic algorithms, and multi-objective approaches, enable effective trade-offs between energy absorption, weight reduction, and manufacturability. Persistent challenges remain in structural optimization, overreliance on numerical simulations with limited experimental validation, and narrow focus on a few bio-inspired geometries and thermo-electro-mechanical coupling, for which engineering solutions are proposed. The review concludes with future research directions focused on geometric optimization, multi-physics modeling, and industrial integration strategies.

By constructing fishbone-shaped Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) arrays onto the grid walls and introducing Absorbent Honeycomb Sandwich Structure (AHS) as its small-scale configuration, Hierarchical Grid Hybrid Absorber (HGHA) is proposed. By deriving the equivalent models of absorbent honeycomb, its Electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical properties are decoupled. The high relative permittivity and dielectric loss of AHS, combined with the local strong E-filed excited by the CFRP arrays, broaden the absorption band towards lower frequency and significantly reduce the reflection loss (RL), respectively. After optimization, HGHA achieves broadband (2–18 GHz), wide-angle (0–60°), and efficient (average RL = −16.9 dB) EM wave absorption. Furthermore, honeycomb provide efficient lateral support for the grid walls, changing its failure mode from elastic buckling to plastic microbuckling. Thus, the specific compressive strength and specific energy absorption of HGHA is improved by 99.3% and 173%, respectively, compared to grid sandwich structure.

This study proposes an anisotropic auxetic configuration—the re-entrant circular star-shaped honeycomb (RECSH)—to enhance energy absorption and reduce initial peak force. A comprehensive investigation involving experimental testing, theoretical modelling, and finite element (FE) simulations was carried out to evaluate the in-plane quasi-static compressive behaviour of RECSH. The results revealed a two-plateau deformation response, each of which exhibited a distinct stress plateau attributed to the structural support provided by the embedded circular geometry. A theoretical framework based on plastic dissipation was developed to predict the plateau stresses, and the influence of key geometric parameters on deformation modes and energy absorption was systematically examined. A multi-objective optimisation strategy was used by a Kriging surrogate model and NSGA-II algorithm to identify an optimal configuration with improved crashworthiness. Compared with conventional designs, the optimised RECSH demonstrates enhanced specific energy absorption (SEA) and reduces initial peak stress (IPS) in both x- and y-directions. This novel auxetic structure offers promising potential for applications in impact mitigation and crash protection systems. © 2025 The Authors","Anisotropic Poisson's ratio; Auxetic honeycomb; Energy absorption; Enhanced performance; Plateau stress; Structural optimisation","Accidents; Anisotropy; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Structural optimization; Anisotropic poisson ratio; Auxetic honeycomb; Auxetics; Energy; Enhanced performance; Limited energies; Performance; Plateau stress; Star-shaped; Structural optimisations; Energy absorption","Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Cheng, Hongchun, Shear Stiffness and Energy Absorption of Auxetic Open Cell Foams as Sandwich Cores, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 256, 1, (2019); Li, Zichuan, Indentation resistance of brittle auxetic structures: Combining discrete representation and continuum model, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 252, (2021); Jiang, Wei, Manufacturing, characteristics and applications of auxetic foams: A state-of-the-art review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 235, (2022); Teng, Xingchi, A simple 3D re-entrant auxetic metamaterial with enhanced energy absorption, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 229, (2022); Etemadi, Ehsan, Enhancing the energy absorption capability of auxetic metamaterials through auxetic cells within re-entrant circular units, Engineering Structures, 315, (2024); Jiang, Feng, Fabrication and crushing response of graded re-entrant circular auxetic honeycomb, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 242, (2023); Li, Zhen, In-plane crushing behaviors of piecewise linear graded honeycombs, Composite Structures, 207, pp. 425-437, (2019); Heo, Hyeonu, Compliant cellular structures: Application to a passive morphing airfoil, Composite Structures, 106, pp. 560-569, (2013); Zhou, Xinran, 3D Printed Auxetic Structure-Assisted Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting and Sensing, Advanced Energy Materials, 13, 34, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

As a common type of lattice structure, honeycomb structures exhibit superior mechanical properties and have been widely studied and applied. Based on the traditional panel-based honeycomb structure, two types of truss-honeycomb structures-HS and FHS-were designed in this study by integrating topology optimization and multi-scale reinforcement design strategies. The structures were fabricated using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology. Their performance was analyzed through pendulum impact tests, quasi-static compression tests, and drop-weight impact tests, accompanied by finite element simulations of both quasi-static compression and drop-weight impact processes. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the FHS structure exhibits significantly higher yield strength than the HS structure. Moreover, for different height-to-width ratios, the energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the FHS structures are consistently greater than those of the HS structures. In addition, the FHS structures demonstrate more stable failure modes during impact loading, and their energy absorption performance can be further enhanced by adjusting the height-to-width ratio. Overall, compared with conventional honeycomb structures, the FHS structures not only achieve more pronounced lightweight characteristics but also exhibit superior mechanical properties and stable energy absorption behavior. This design approach offers a novel pathway for enhancing the energy absorption capacity and improving the impact resistance of truss structures. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy absorption; Failure modes; Impact testing; Lattice structures","Compression testing; Compressive strength; Design for testability; Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; Marine navigation; Model structures; Offshore technology; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Subsea engineering; Trusses; Absorption performance; Drop-weight impacts; Energy; Impact behavior; Impact energy; Lattice structures; Mechanical; Property; Quasi-static compression; Width ratio; Impact testing; absorption; additive; computer simulation; experimental study; manufacturing; numerical model; optimization","Angadi, S.

Traditional surrogate model-based optimization methods can only ensure that the crashworthiness indicators meet the design expectations. However, unstable buckling and drastic load fluctuations cannot be avoided. In view of this, a multi-dimensional crashworthiness performance prediction and constrained optimization of a novel kind of honeycomb-filled composite structure are investigated. By utilizing the deep learning technique, the deformation images, crashworthiness indicators and load curves of the structure are predicted and introduced as constraints to the multi-objective optimization. Compared to the regular optimization results, the range of the Pareto front is significantly reduced after the introduction of extra constraints. Furthermore, the best solution obtained from the constrained optimization not only satisfy the conventional indicators constraint, but also performs well in terms of the deformation mode and load history. By applying the proposed method, the reliability of the optimization is dramatically improved. It is well proved that the proposed methodology can provide a feasible reference for similar problems of crashworthiness optimization of energy-absorbing structures. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Constrained optimization; Crash performance; Deep learning; Honeycomb-filled composite structures","Composites structures; Crash performance; Deep learning; Energy absorbing structure; Filled composites; Honeycomb-filled composite structure; Multi dimensional; Optimisations; Performance prediction; Railway vehicles; Honeycomb structures; composite; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment","Xu, Ping, Energy distribution analysis and multi-objective optimization of a gradual energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 115, pp. 255-263, (2017); Xing, Jie, Crashworthiness optimisation of a step-like bi-tubular energy absorber for subway vehicles, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 25, 3, pp. 252-262, (2020); Xing, Jie, Study on the layout strategy of diaphragms to enhance the energy absorption of thin-walled square tubes, Structures, 29, pp. 294-304, (2021); Xu, Ping, The coordinated design and optimisation of combined energy-absorbing structure with multi-level thin-walled tapered square tubes, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 29, 5, pp. 823-837, (2024); Xie, Suchao, Design and analysis of a composite energy-absorbing structure for use on railway vehicles, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 230, 3, pp. 825-839, (2016); Zhou, Hui, Composite energy-absorbing structures combining thin-walled metal and honeycomb structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 231, 4, pp. 394-405, (2017); Yao, Shuguang, The impact performance of honeycomb-filled structures under eccentric loading for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 123, pp. 360-370, (2018); Wang, Zhonggang, Matching effect of honeycomb-filled thin-walled square tube—Experiment and simulation, Composite Structures, 157, pp. 494-505, (2016); Hussein, Rafea Dakhil, Crushing response of square aluminium tubes filled with polyurethane foam and aluminium honeycomb, Thin-Walled Structures, 110, pp. 140-154, (2017); Xie, Suchao, Crashworthiness of Nomex® honeycomb-filled anti-climbing energy absorbing devices, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 26, 2, pp. 121-132, (2021)",""

To address this, we propose a novel re-entrant diamond-enhanced honeycomb (RE-DEH) that combines two geometric designs: the re-entrant honeycomb (REH) and diamond-enhanced honeycomb (DEH). Compared to REH with identical wall thicknesses, the RE-DEH demonstrates significantly higher specific stiffness and Specific Energy Absorption (SEA). Additionally, a parametric study of the geometric configuration reveals that the inclination angle a of the REH is the dominant factor governing both energy absorption capacity and Poisson's ratio. Further optimization using a bi-material configuration − where modified PLA materials of varying stiffness are applied to REH and DEH regions − reduces the magnitude of the average Poisson's ratio by 50 % (from −0.36 to −0.54) while maintaining low relative density. Simultaneously, this design increases the SEA to 1.20 J/g, representing a 23.71 % enhancement over single-material counterparts. Therefore, the bi-material structure design is an effective strategy to overcome the trade-off between the energy absorption and auxetic effect, providing a new approach for the optimization of honeycomb structure. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic performance; Bi-material structure; Compression response; Energy absorption capability; Re-entrant diamond-enhanced honeycomb (RE-DEH)","Dynamic response; Geometry; Light absorption; Structural dynamics; Auxetic performance; Auxetics; Bi-material; Bimaterial structure; Compression response; Energy absorption capability; Energy absorption capacity; In-plane compression; Performance; Re-entrant diamond-enhanced honeycomb; Honeycomb structures","Guo, Yongguang, Deformation behaviors and energy absorption of auxetic lattice cylindrical structures under axial crushing load, Aerospace Science and Technology, 98, (2020); Montazeri, Amin, Auxetic mechanical metamaterials with symmetry-broken Re-entrant units, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 266, (2024); Choudhry, Niranjan Kumar, Auxetic lattice reinforcement for tailored mechanical properties in cementitious composite: Experiments and modelling, Construction and Building Materials, 438, (2024); Zhao, Aiguo, Evaluation of shock migration performance for a multi-stable mechanical metamaterial, Composite Structures, 321, (2023); Fu, Minghui, Nonlinear shear modulus of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs under large deformation, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 80, pp. 284-296, (2016); Xiao, Lijun, Compressive performance and energy absorption of additively manufactured metallic hybrid lattice structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 219, (2022); Yang, Wanchun, Ballistic impact responses and failure mechanism of composite double-arrow auxetic structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 174, (2022); Gao, Qiang, On the low-velocity impact responses of auxetic double arrowed honeycomb, Aerospace Science and Technology, 98, (2020); Wei, Lulu, A novel star auxetic honeycomb with enhanced in-plane crushing strength, Thin-Walled Structures, 149, (2020); Chen, Yuwen, In-plane compression characteristics of star-shaped honeycomb with asymmetric cells, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 105, (2024)",""

Establishing an equivalent model can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization design and performance analysis, and the reliability and precision of the model are directly associated with the accuracy of equivalent mechanical parameters of the honeycomb core. Modal behavior analysis can prevent the structural damage and failure caused by the resonance, and is particularly important to the dynamic design of sandwich structures. Hence, an equivalent model establishment method considering the influence of the modal behavior on the equivalent mechanical parameters is developed for the curved sandwich structure with concave hexagonal honeycomb. A preliminary equivalent model is established by combining the derived equivalent mechanical parameters along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions of the core with the sandwich panel theory. Three-point bending tests are performed on curved concave hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structures with photosensitive resin core and carbon fiber face sheets, and the test data are compared with the finite element results of actual models and preliminary equivalent models. The equivalent mechanical parameters of the core (i.e., the material properties of the core's equivalent model) are optimized by a genetic algorithm to minimize the average relative error between the first four modal frequencies of the equivalent model and those of the actual model, and the accuracy improvement of modified equivalent model is further understood through modal analysis. The results show that the simulated load–displacement curves of actual model and preliminary equivalent model are basically consistent with the test data of the actual model, and optimizing the equivalent mechanical parameters of the core, in which the modal behavior is considered, significantly reduces the relative errors between the equivalent model and actual model. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Curved concave hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structure; Equivalent mechanical parameters optimization; Equivalent model; Modal behavior","Bending tests; Dynamic response; Failure rate; Machine vibrations; Modal analysis; Sandwich structures; Vibration analysis; Curved concave hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structure; Equivalent mechanical parameter optimization; Equivalent mechanical parameters; Equivalent modeling; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Modal behavior; Parameter optimization; Test data; Uniform stress distributions; Honeycomb structures","Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of sandwich plates with GLARE face-sheets and honeycomb core under metal foam projectile impact: Experimental and numerical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 164, (2022); Mech Adv Mater Struct, (2023); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Le, Vinh Tung, Advanced sandwich structures for thermal protection systems in hypersonic vehicles: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 226, (2021); Lombardi, Nicolas J., Steel hexagonal honeycomb core equivalent elastic Moduli for bridge deck sandwich panels, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 23, 1, pp. 62-69, (2010); Wang, Wei, Comparative application analysis and test verification on equivalent modeling theories of honeycomb sandwich panels for satellite solar arrays, Advanced Composites Letters, 29, (2020); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences, (1948); Gibson, Lorna J., MECHANICS OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL CELLULAR MATERIALS., 382, 1782, pp. 25-42, (1982)",""

This study systematically investigates the mechanical performance of titanium alloy honeycomb implants featuring variable twisted angles (0°–180°), aiming to optimize implant design for improved stress distribution in peri-implant bone tissue. Combined with finite element (FE) simulation and an in-vitro experimental platform based on a masticatory robot, the mechanical response of the implant under static compression and chewing different textures of food were analyzed. The results demonstrated an inverse relationship between torsional angle and both relative density and energy absorption capacity. Low-torsion configurations (≤60°) exhibited superior performance, reducing stress concentrations at thread roots and tails by 1.3–5.3 % compared to conventional designs under single axial load, while reducing by 1.5–7.2 % under combined load. The maximum strain at implant-bone interface was reduced by 1.6–3.4 % under single load and 8.9–14 % under combined load through the geometric torsion of the internal honeycomb structure, respectively. In-vitro test results showed that the low-torsion structure (<90°) was more advantageous in reducing mechanical stimulation of bone tissue during chewing hard and brittle food.

Theoretical formulas based on the energy-balance model were established to predict the total energy absorption, maximum impact force and residual lower facesheet deflection of both the conventional (Type 1 structure) and hierarchical (Type 2 structure) honeycomb sandwich structures. A polynomial model was used to establish the regression equations for the structural stiffness, upper facesheet indentation depth, and residual lower facesheet deflection of the sandwich structures with double-layer graded hierarchical honeycomb cores (Type 3 structure). The improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm was employed to perform a multi-objective optimization design on the impact responses of Type 3 structures. The results showed that both the hierarchical and graded hierarchical honeycomb cores can improve the stiffness and impact resistance of sandwich structures when the density of sandwich structures was same. However, under an impact energy of 100J, applying the hierarchical honeycomb core to the Type 2 structure increased the deflection of the lower facesheet. Compared to the Type 1 structure, the optimized Type 3 structure exhibited the highest structural stiffness and both the smallest upper facesheet indentation depth and the smallest residual lower facesheet deflection under an impact energy of 100J, with improvements of 39%, 15%, and 33%, respectively. Moreover, the low-velocity impact responses of Type 2 and Type 3 structures were influenced by the structural organization parameter and the gradient rate. The promising results of the present study may be expected to provide some insights for the design of more efficient crashworthy structures. © The Author(s) 2025","finite element analysis; graded honeycomb; hierarchical honeycomb; impact response; Sandwich structure","Deflection (structures); Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization; Structural panels; 2-structure; Face sheets; Finite element analyse; Graded honeycomb; Hierarchical honeycomb; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact energy; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Sandwich structures","Palomba, Giulia, Single and double-layer honeycomb sandwich panels under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 121, pp. 77-90, (2018); Sun, Guangyong, Dynamic response of sandwich panel with hierarchical honeycomb cores subject to blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 142, pp. 499-515, (2019); Ha, Ngoc-san, A review of recent research on bio-inspired structures and materials for energy absorption applications, Composites Part B: Engineering, 181, (2020); Sutherland, L.

This study introduces an interesting honeycomb structure known as the hybrid topological cellular honeycomb structure (HTCHS), which integrates four distinctive topological cells. To effectively fabricate HTCHS samples, the research utilized a fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, employing polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG) as the matrix material, successfully producing the HTCHS samples. A finite element simulation model for the HTCHS is created using LS-DYNA software(LS-DYNA R11.1.0 software), and its accuracy is confirmed through a comparative analysis of experimental and simulation results. The influence of the topological cell parameters (T<inf>1</inf> to T<inf>4</inf>) on compressive energy absorption, specific energy absorption, and peak crushing force through parametric modeling is investigated. The mechanical properties of honeycomb structures vary depending on the cell parameters at different positions, and monotonically increasing the design parameters does not improve the energy absorption capacity of the HTCHS. To enhance the mechanical performance of the HTCHS, the initial periodic cell configurations are transformed into non-periodic designs. A discrete optimization design framework for local parameters of the HTCHS is established, integrating cell coding with the MOPSO algorithm. The feasibility of the optimization results is validated through experimental data, demonstrating that this study offers an effective technical solution for developing a novel generation of cellular honeycomb structures with customizable mechanical properties. © 2025 by the authors.","3D printing; bionics design; energy absorption; honeycomb structures; mechanical property","Bearings (machine parts); Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Bionics; Cells; Computer aided design; Computer software; Cytology; Loads (forces); Structural design; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bio-inspired designs; Bionic design; Cell parameterS; Cellulars; Energy; Mechanical; Property; Structure samples; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Xu, Xiang, Adjustable Ultra-Light Mechanical Negative Poisson's Ratio Metamaterials with Multi-Level Dynamic Crushing Effects, Small, 20, 43, (2024); Hirankittiwong, Pemika, Advanced engineered nanostructures for aerospace technology: A review, Results in Engineering, 26, (2025); Zinno, Alberto, Experimental characterization of phenolic-impregnated honeycomb sandwich structures for transportation vehicles, Composite Structures, 93, 11, pp. 2910-2924, (2011); Alabtah, Fatima Ghassan, Energy absorption characteristics of a bio-inspired prepreg carbon fiber crash box under quasi-static axial compression, Composites Part C: Open Access, 14, (2024); Wang, Danqi, Safety assessment of intelligent vehicles considering drivers’ risk perception information under interval 2-tuple q-rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets, Applied Soft Computing, 175, (2025); Haq, Ahsan Ul, Experimental and numerical investigation on the ballistic impact performance of sandwich panels with additively manufactured honeycomb cores, Aerospace Science and Technology, 155, (2024); Ul Haq, Ahsan, Dynamic response of honeycomb cored sandwich panels under high velocity impact: A numerical study, Materials Today: Proceedings, (2023); Silva, Rita De Cássia, Effect of 3D-Printed Honeycomb Core on Compressive Property of Hybrid Energy Absorbers: Experimental Testing and Optimization Analysis, Materials, 17, 2, (2024); Song, Jian, Energy-Absorption Behavior of Novel Bio-Inspired Thin-Walled Honeycomb Tubes Filled with TPMS Structure, Coatings, 14, 6, (2024); Ju, Jinlong, Experiment and Simulation Study on the Crashworthiness of Markforged 3D-Printed Carbon/Kevlar Hybrid Continuous Fiber Composite Honeycomb Structures, Materials, 18, 1, (2025)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The investigation analyzed chiral structures such as lozenge and clepsydra, as well as geometries with wavy patterns such as roller and Es, in addition to a honeycomb structure. All geometries have a relative density of 50%. After being subjected to three-point bending tests, the capacity to spring back with respect to the bending angle and the shape recovery of the structures were measured. The roller and lozenge structures demonstrated the best performance, with shape recovery assessed through three consecutive hot water immersion cycles. The lozenge structure exhibits 25% higher energy absorption than the roller, but the latter ensures better replicability and shape stability. Additionally, the roller absorbs 15% less energy than the lozenge, which experiences a 27% decrease in absorption between the first and second cycle.

To integrate biological features into structures and achieve adjustable feature scales, an image–physics driven topology optimization method (IPTO) is proposed. In this method, “image” represents the biological feature image, while “physics” refers to the optimization process based on the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) framework. The visual geometry group 19-layer network (VGG19) is employed to extract biological features, such as honeycombs and fish scales, and integrate them into the SIMP framework to minimize compliance, thereby embedding biological features into materials. To adjust the size of biological features in the generated structure, a block periodic filling strategy is adopted. Features extracted by the VGG19 are adaptively reduced with network depth l, and empty regions are filled to achieve a stepwise reduction of feature size with increasing depth. To adjust the density of biological features in the generated structure, a biological feature density control weight β is introduced, allowing effective adjustments to the density of the biological features. In addition, refer to images of earthworm skin, cuttlebone, teeth, a combination of cuttlebone and teeth, and leaf venation to further validate the effectiveness of the suggested method. Finally, static pressure tests are conducted to assess the energy absorption advantages of biological features, taking the optimized honeycomb structure as an example. Compared to the traditional SIMP structure, the optimized honeycomb structure has a 17.4% improvement in energy absorption, with only a 2.3% increase in compliance. These results demonstrate the potential of IPTO for optimization of multifunctional structures. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Biological features; Convolutional neural network; Topology optimization","Biological materials; Biological systems; Energy absorption; Network layers; Network topology; Neural networks; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Biological features; Biological structures; Convolutional neural network; Energy; Layer networks; Multifunctionality; Solid isotropic material with penalizations; Topology optimisation; Topology Optimization Method; Honeycomb structures","Abueidda, Diab W., Topology optimization of 2D structures with nonlinearities using deep learning, Computers and Structures, 237, (2020); Bendsøe, Martin Philip, Generating optimal topologies in structural design using a homogenization method, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 71, 2, pp. 197-224, (1988); Bruyneel, Michaël, A family of MMA approximations for structural optimization, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 24, 4, pp. 263-276, (2002); Yelmen, Burak, Deep convolutional and conditional neural networks for large-scale genomic data generation, PLOS Computational Biology, 19, 10 October, (2023); Cui, Chengyun, Novel cuttlebone-inspired hierarchical bionic structure enabled high energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 186, (2023); Czarnecki, Slawomir, Auxetic Properties of the Stiffest Elastic Bodies as a Result of Topology Optimization and Microstructures Recovery Based on Homogenization Method, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 261, 12, (2024); Dong, Xiaohu, Optimal layout of internal stiffeners for three-dimensional box structures based on natural branching phenomena, Engineering Optimization, 51, 4, pp. 590-607, (2019); Xiong, Min, Bionic hierarchy growth method for optimal design of dendritic heat transfer structure, Engineering Optimization, 52, 7, pp. 1149-1165, (2020); Andreassen, Erik, Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 43, 1, pp. 1-16, (2011); Fang, Gang, Bionic octopus structure Inspired Stress-Driven reconfigurable microwave absorption and multifunctional compatibility in infrared stealth and De-icing, Chemical Engineering Journal, 467, (2023)",""

This study develops a three-dimensional equivalent Cauchy continuum model (3D-ECM) based on the variational asymptotic method (VAM) to efficiently predict the mechanical response of the accordion honeycomb. The accuracy of the 3D-ECM is validated via quasi-static compression experiments on 3D-printed specimens and detailed 3D finite element simulations (3D-FEM), showing a strong correlation between simulation and experimental data. Parametric analyses reveal that the re-entrant angle, ligament-to-strut length ratio, and thickness ratios significantly affect the equivalent elastic moduli, providing insights into geometric optimization strategies for targeted mechanical performance. Comparative experiments among honeycomb structures with positive, negative, and zero Poisson’s ratios show that the accordion honeycomb achieves superior dimensional stability and tunable stiffness but exhibits lower energy-absorption efficiency due to discontinuous buckling and recovery processes. Further comparison among different ZPR honeycombs confirms that the accordion design offers the highest equivalent modulus in the re-entrant direction.

The 4D printing technique is being studied for use in many different areas. This study investigates two distinct functions: deployable applications and energy absorption capabilities. It assesses the potential of 4D printing alongside the energy-absorbing properties of honeycomb lattice structures fabricated from a blend of polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The research focuses on the effects of different TPU volume fractions (0%, 20%, and 60%) on shape memory and energy absorption of multi-materials by integrating TPU rasters within the PLA outline walls. To evaluate the pertinent properties, shape memory and compression tests were performed. The energy absorption up to the initial peak and the densification were assessed through the compression tests. Findings revealed that a lattice structure composed solely of PLA demonstrated the highest energy absorption. The configuration with a 20% TPU volume fraction, i.e., one TPU raster positioned between the PLA infill, was determined to be the most effective lattice structure for shape memory and impact protection, as indicated by the analysis of the shape memory index, energy absorption, and plateau stress. 4D printing, which integrates time-dependent behavior into 3D-printed materials, offers significant potential in deployable systems and impact protection. Shape memory tests revealed maximum fixity and recovery ratios of 94% and 97%, respectively. The shape memory index (SMI) reached its highest value (77%) in the 1 TPU raster configuration (20% TPU). Compression tests after recovery indicated the pure PLA lattice exhibited the highest plateau stress (8.31 MPa) and EA up to densification (48.1 J). Optimization using desirability function analysis (DFA) identified 1 TPU raster as the optimal configuration.

Five FSCS models with different cushion layer thicknesses and densities were tested in a large-scale enclosed blast-resistant device. The results found that the FSCS models remained undamaged when subjected to long-duration plane wave loading with a peak pressure of 0.6 MPa and a duration of 200 ms. Increasing the cushion layer thickness enhanced pressure attenuation from 65.31 % at 15 mm to 75.71 % at 25 mm, while lower-density foam-geopolymer materials exhibited better attenuation, reaching 80.59 % at 579 kg/m³ compared to 66.36 % at 1166 kg/m³ . The top of the cylinder experienced pressure four times higher than the lateral center, with peak displacement and acceleration amplitude increasing by 60 % and 90 %, respectively. Circumferential strain was more pronounced than axial strain, while the inner wall of the lining primarily underwent elastic deformation. Furthermore, a dynamic mechanical model for underground circular tunnels under long-duration planar loading was developed, incorporating an optimal cushion layer thickness calculation method that considers material self-weight and impedance effects. This model accurately predicts the deflection variation of underground sandwich cylindrical structures at any time, providing crucial insights for the design and optimization of cushion energy-absorbing layers in sandwich structures. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Cushion layer thickness; Foam geopolymer; Long-duration load; Plane wave; Sandwich structure","Cylinders (shapes); Deflection (structures); Dynamic response; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Shock waves; Structural dynamics; Blast resistant; Cushion layer thickness; Cushion layers; Cylindrical structure; Foam geopolymer; Geopolymer; Layer thickness; Long duration; Long-duration load; Plane wave; Sandwich structures; dynamic response; experimental study; loading; polymer; strain; structural response; theoretical study","Wang, Yanchao, Blast resisting responses and upgrading technology for an underground structure subjected to external explosions, Structures, 56, (2023); Mandal, Jagriti, Underground Structures Subjected to Various Blast Loading Scenarios: A Scoping Review, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 29, 4, pp. 2491-2512, (2022); Li, Hujun, Experimental and numerical simulation of the propagation law of shock waves in corrugated steel-lined tunnels, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 168, pp. 1019-1030, (2022); Anas, S.

The prominent in-plane energy absorption capability of the PRH structure will be widely applied in the field of energy absorbers. First, the internal and external deformation patterns and energy absorption properties of the structure under quasi-static loading were investigated using a validated finite element model, and the effects of the stacking parameters on the mechanical properties of the structure under internal and external compression were discussed. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model with plateau stress and specific energy absorption (SEA) under in-plane loading of the PRH structure was developed and solved using the response surface methodology, NSGA-II genetic algorithm and TOPSIS decision making method. The best solution of the proxy model for plateau stress and SEA under in-plane loading of the PRH structure was found, and it was compared with similar models such as pre-folded hexagonal honeycomb (PHH) and origami-based re-entrant honeycomb (OBH). It was found that the energy absorption properties of this structure are better under in-plane loading, and the SEAm and SEAv of PRH were 24% and 53.23% higher than those of PHH. The SEAm and SEAv of the PRH were 66.77% and 50.46% higher than those of OBH, respectively.

The most commonly designed MMs such as honeycomb and re-entrant auxetics are prone to failure at the sharp corners and weak joints due to the increased stress concentration under deformation. To mitigate this challenge, braided MM structures involving intertwining threads of nylon—forming curved unit cells—have been studied. These textile-inspired cylindrical braided metamaterials (CBMMs) with contrasting unit cells, namely diamond and regular CBMMs, were fabricated by 3D printing. The layer-by-layer deposited structure built by fused filament fabrication delivered an assembly of overlapped threads that are fused at the contact point. To understand deformation behavior of these MMs, finite element models were developed for various load scenarios including quasi-static compression, cyclic and creep loads at room temperature. Stress distribution, deformation mechanisms, and failure modes were analyzed and validated by experiments to analyze the geometries and associated performance. The diamond CBMMs showed stress softening at 30 % compressive strain, withstanding a load of ∼440 N, whereas the regular CBMMs at 50 % strain experienced ∼250 N. The diamond CBMMs delivered higher creep resistance under sustained load and better energy absorption under cyclic loading than the regular CBMMs. The latter, however, exhibited 94 % shape recovery in contrast to 88 % recovery in former prototype during their first cyclic load. This study helps design mechanical lightweight devices that endure significant sustained load and exhibit enhanced energy absorption and shape recovery characteristics in cyclic loading. © 2025","Creep; Cyclic loading; Cylindrical braided metamaterials; Finite element analysis; Quasi-static compression; Specific energy absorption","Creep resistance; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Loading; Recovery; Shape optimization; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Structural design; Structures (built objects); Textiles; Absorption recovery; Cyclic loading; Cylindrical braided metamaterial; Energy; Finite element analyse; Mechanical; Quasi-static compression; Shape recovery; Specific energy absorption; Unit cells; Creep; Cyclic loads; Metamaterials","Gilmer, Eric L., Temperature, diffusion, and stress modeling in filament extrusion additive manufacturing of polyetherimide: An examination of the influence of processing parameters and importance of modeling assumptions, Additive Manufacturing, 48, (2021); Traxel, Kellen D., Naturally architected microstructures in structural materials via additive manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, 34, (2020); Adanur, Sabit, Additive manufacturing of interlaced fibrous structures, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 27, 4, pp. 671-681, (2021); Bodaghi, M., Self-expanding/shrinking structures by 4D printing, Smart Materials and Structures, 25, 10, (2016); Jang, Dongchan, Fabrication and deformation of three-dimensional hollow ceramic nanostructures, Nature Materials, 12, 10, pp. 893-898, (2013); Meza, Lucas R., Resilient 3D hierarchical architected metamaterials, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 37, pp. 11502-11507, (2015); Vyatskikh, Andrey, Additive manufacturing of 3D nano-architected metals, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Kolken, Helena M.A., Auxetic mechanical metamaterials, RSC Advances, 7, 9, pp. 5111-5129, (2017); Yang, Li, Additive Manufacturing of Metal Cellular Structures: Design and Fabrication, JOM, 67, 3, pp. 608-615, (2015); Surjadi, James Utama, Mechanical Metamaterials and Their Engineering Applications, Advanced Engineering Materials, 21, 3, (2019)",""

This study investigates the effects of laser-induced graphene (LIG) and short Kevlar fibers on the interfacial toughness of aramid fiber/foam aluminum sandwich panels, aiming to enhance the interfacial bonding capability of the structure. Results demonstrate that the synergistic toughening effect of LIG and short Kevlar fibers significantly improves the interlaminar toughness, with a 134.90% increase in peak load and a 161.64% increase in energy absorption during the three-point bending tests. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis reveals the toughening mechanism: the micro-porous structure of LIG provides effective adhesion points for the short Kevlar fibers, creating a stable fiber bridging structure that mitigates interface delamination. Furthermore, optimization of the surface density of the short Kevlar fibers for the LIG-coated aramid fiber/aluminum foam sandwich panels shows a trend of increasing toughness followed by a decline with increasing surface density, with optimal interfacial performance achieved at a surface density of 6 g/m2. These findings suggest that the combined approach of LIG and short Kevlar fibers is an effective strategy for enhancing the interfacial toughness of aramid fiber/foam aluminum sandwich panels, with promising applications in composite materials. Highlights: LIG-Kevlar fibers improve toughness & energy absorption in sandwich panels. The optimal short Kevlar fiber density for interfacial performance is 6 g/m2.

This study innovatively introduces Fractal theory, which breaks the traditional paradigm of optimizing homogeneous materials, and establishes in 3D printed honeycomb structures a quantitative mapping relationship between crack propagation paths and fractal dimensions. The investigation focuses on 6 mm hexagonal honeycomb units, along with 5 mm and 10 mm square variants, exploring their drone design applications based on size-specific energy absorption characteristics. Using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, we manufactured polylactic acid (PLA) honeycomb samples with hexagonal (Hex6) and square (Sq5, Sq10) topologies, with their mechanical responses characterized through quasi-static bending tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the hexagonal structure exhibits a unique multi-stage energy dissipation mechanism, showing 2.7% and 21.0% higher energy absorption capacity (0.7031 ± 0.0296 MJ/m3) compared to Sq5 (0.6847 ± 0.1213 MJ/m3) and Sq10 (0.5812 ± 0.0666 MJ/m3), respectively.

However, limited research has addressed their operational lifespan and manufacturing variability, both of which are critical for practical implementation. This study aims to establish a design optimization framework for NSH-UCs that accounts for both performance metrics such as energy absorption (EA) and operational aspects like reusability and manufacturing-induced uncertainty. To this end, NSH-UC specimens with varying dimensions were fabricated using fused filament fabrication with PLA/PHA filaments, and their mechanical behavior was evaluated through quasi-static and cyclic compression tests. A surrogate-based optimization method was then applied to improve EA and extend operational lifespan, while considering geometric and material uncertainties inherent to the additive manufacturing process. The proposed framework led to a significant improvement in EA and end-of-life performance compared to the initial design, despite only modest changes in specific EA. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating performance, reliability, and manufacturing variability into early-stage design, highlighting the framework’s potential for structural health monitoring and prognostics and health management applications. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The mechanical properties and deformation modes of the honeycomb structure demonstrate significant variations under both in-plane and out-of-plane loadings, with the strength and impact resistance under out-of-plane loading being markedly superior to those observed under in-plane loading. However, there exists a distinct lack of systematic and comprehensive research regarding the influence of relative density, loading speed, and microstructure on the crushing behavior of in-plane rhombic honeycomb structures. Consequently, this paper presents an innovative design and research initiative focused on the rhombic honeycomb enhanced by self-similar inclusions (RHESSI honeycomb), systematically analyzing its impact resistance characteristics in the in-plane direction. Specifically, the paper undertakes a design analysis of structures with varying relative densities and conducts an in-depth investigation of impact resistance indicators across different loading speeds. Furthermore, it examines the deformation mode of the structure under in-plane impact and calculates the optimal wall thickness to enhance the energy absorption characteristics of the structure. It is believed that as the hierarchy increases, the CFE of the structure increases accordingly, with the maximum increase reaching 104.66%; meanwhile, the IPCF decreases, with the maximum decrease being 50.49%.

To prevent potential damage, various strategies have been attempted to date with limited success. Among possible strategies, the current study investigated the unique capabilities of energy-absorbing aluminum composites in providing a protective panel to resist impact-induced forces. To achieve a holistic assessment, three core alternatives, i.e., aluminum honeycomb, aluminum foam, and expanded polystyrene foam, sandwiched between aluminum plates, were considered in this study. The selected composite panels had been used as impact-resistant components in mechanical and aerospace engineering applications, but their applications in the civil engineering domain had remained marginal, mainly because of limited studies performed on them. To address the fundamental questions related to the response of this category of composites to over-height collisions, the current study utilized a set of high-fidelity finite-element models. The developed models were validated with a suite of experimental test results from past studies. The models replicated two representative concrete girders, each without and with energy-absorbing composite panels. The added panels were in various configurations, in terms of geometric and material properties. Upon simulating the over-height collision with a range of impact intensities and velocities, key response measures were evaluated, including energy absorption, impact force, and girder damage. This holistic investigation's outcome led to a set of recommendations on the energy-absorbing composites of choice configured to minimize the damage from over-height collisions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Design optimization; Energy-absorbing composites; Impact analysis; Over-height collision; Structural response","Honeycomb structures; Pressure vessels; 'current; Aluminum composites; Composite panels; Concrete superstructures; Design optimization; Energy; Energy-absorbing composite; Impact analysis; Over-height collision; Structural response; Concrete beams and girders; aluminum; civil engineering; collision; composite; concrete structure; energy flow; holistic approach; impact; structural analysis; structural component; structural response","undefined, (2013); Elshazli, Mohamed T., Comprehensive Numerical Modeling of Prestressed Girder Bridges under Low-Velocity Impact, Buildings, 14, 3, (2024); Nguyen, Bella, Understanding the Problem of Bridge and Tunnel Strikes Caused by Over-height Vehicles, Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 3915-3924, (2016); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2008); Yang, Mijia, Analysis of cushion systems for impact protection design of bridges against overheight vehicle collision, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 12, pp. 1220-1228, (2010); Cheng, Shi, Numerical analysis of I-Lam honeycomb sandwich panels for collision protection of reinforced concrete beams, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 19, 4, pp. 497-522, (2017); Li, Xiangcheng, Experimental study on out-of-plane mechanical and energy absorption properties of combined hexagonal aluminum honeycombs under dynamic impact, Materials and Design, 194, (2020); Pietras, Daniel, Out-of-plane crushing response of aluminum honeycombs in-situ filled with graphene-reinforced polyurethane foam, Composite Structures, 249, (2020); Han, Qigang, Study on mechanical properties of multi-structure dactyl-inspired sandwich honeycomb with basalt fiber, Composite Structures, 247, (2020)",""

In this present study, a novel double-core hexagonal sandwich structure filled with aluminum (Al) foam is used to investigate the structural response under blast loading subjected to 1 to 3 kg of charge of TNT kept at a stand-off distance (SoD) of 100 mm. The investigation and its assessment are mainly focused on the deflection of the face sheets and the energy absorption capacity of the panel. The Johnson-Cook plasticity model and crushable foam hardening are used in stainless steel and Al foam, respectively, to examine the performance under blast loading. The conventional weapons effect programme (ConWep) method is employed for numerical modeling and blast load analysis. Subsequently, a comparison is made between the blast resistance of the double-core sandwich structure and that of the experimental results of the single-core sandwich structure obtained from previous literature. Further, to improve the performance of the developed double-core sandwich structure, an optimization study is conducted using the genetic algorithm (GA) and the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to explore single- and multi-objective problems, respectively. The results showed that for the single-objective optimization, the maximum back facesheet deflection is reduced by 13.35% at constant mass compared to the initial design, while for the multi-objective optimization, five optimal design values are obtained from the Pareto front and can be seen as a potential replacement for single-core panels.

The present research addresses the original combination of 3-D printing with reinforcement of concrete and cementitious compounds, especially relating to Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). The investigation comprehensively covers the effect of the use of various printing materials and reinforcement constructs, and focuses on geometry as an important parameter to adjust the mechanical properties and ductility of the printed materials. Using deep analyses, it has been concluded that FDM becomes a key technology in the 3D-printing of reinforced concrete and cement members, which permits design optimization of structural performance. The results highlight that the geometrical features of the reinforcement are crucially important to the improvement in flexural strength and energy dissipation. Specifically, auxetic and truss geometries are identified as superior configurations for improving these properties, while alternative patterns can significantly augment the ductility and energy absorption capacity of concrete. The flexural strength of reinforced concrete samples improves when concrete is reinforced with lattice truss, honeycomb, and different types of trusses by 27%, 160%, and 12% respectively. When concrete or cementitious mortar is reinforced with auxetic structure and lattice structure, the compressive strength improves by more than 18.5% and 33.7% respectively. While hyperboloid shell and steel auxetic tube are added to concrete, the compressive strength of concrete decreases by more than 20% and 24% respectively.

This study investigates 3D-printed polylactic acid components as mechanical absorbers, focusing on their performance enhancement through thermal post-processing and topology optimization. A key challenge in additive manufacturing is the presence of thermal gradients, which affect interlayer bonding and reduce mechanical strength. Thermal annealing was applied to printed components to address this, significantly improving their crushing resistance. Experimental results showed a 40.6% increase in energy absorption for a simple crash box and a 12.5% improvement for a honeycomb structure. Finite element simulations were used to model the crushing process and guide geometry optimization. The combination of post-processing and optimized lattice structures led to a 32-fold increase in peak crushing force, with only a fivefold increase in component weight.

Origami-inspired metamaterials represent one avenue for design and optimisation of these materials, offering a large geometric design space and a range of unique properties. Potential applications for these materials include shock and vibration attenuation, blast protection, impact energy absorption, deployable and reconfigurable structures, soft robotics, and many others. In order to most effectively utilise the broad design space offered by these materials, effective and efficient material models must be developed. Analytical modelling offers an attractive route for probing such a broad design space more rapidly and at a lower computational cost versus, for example, finite element methods. In this paper the small-strain elastic behaviour of origami-inspired honeycombs that employ the “symmetric diamond Miura-ori” cell geometry is modelled analytically for both in-plane and out-of-plane loading. This analytical model contains two modelling parameters, k¯<inf>1</inf> and k¯<inf>2</inf>, which will are determined using finite element analysis through a curve-fitting process. The finite element modelling includes a comprehensive study of shell elements vs continuum tetrahedral elements, domain size effects, as well as the influence of loading direction on adherence to folding kinematics. Following the calibration of k¯<inf>1</inf> and k¯<inf>2</inf>, the analytical model is used to explore the large design space characteristic of the origami-inspired honeycombs. A high degree of independent tunability of the elastic moduli emerges spanning orders of magnitude. Special cases including tuning of elastic moduli at a constant relative density, tunability of relative density at a constant modulus, and cases of both transverse and full isotropy were investigated and discussed. In this work a novel analytical model is developed, validated by FE analysis, and used to explore the vast design space of these origami-inspired honeycombs. This work also develops further understanding of the FE modelling of small-strain elasticity of these origami-inspired structures. This work highlights the power and efficacy of the novel analytical model for the precise design of highly tunable materials, as well as provide important insights into the FE modelling of the small-strain elasticity of these materials. © 2025 The Authors","Analytical modelling; Anisotropy; Elasticity; Miura-inspired honeycomb; Property tunability; Uniaxial loading","Metamaterials; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Analytical modeling; Design spaces; FE modeling; Miurum-inspired honeycomb; Property; Property tunability; Relative density; Small strains; Tunabilities; Uni-axial loading; Honeycomb structures","Tan, Xiaojun, Bioinspired Flexible and Programmable Negative Stiffness Mechanical Metamaterials, Advanced Intelligent Systems, 5, 6, (2023); Zhang, Kai, Buckling induced negative stiffness mechanical metamaterial for bandgap tuning, Composite Structures, 304, (2023); Mei, Chaosheng, On band gap and damping of metamaterials involving negative-stiffness elements, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 239, (2023); Tan, Xiaojun, Tuning negative stiffness mechanical metamaterial's snap-through behavior with a series-connected spring, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 107, (2024); Zhu, Shaowei, Negative stiffness metamaterial with directional stability in uniform fields, Thin-Walled Structures, 194, (2024); Sang, Sheng, A design of active elastic metamaterials with negative mass density and tunable bulk modulus, Acta Mechanica, 230, 3, pp. 1003-1008, (2019); Chen, Yangyang, A hybrid elastic metamaterial with negative mass density and tunable bending stiffness, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 105, pp. 179-198, (2017); Gao, Yuqiang, Active multifunctional composite metamaterials with negative effective mass density and negative effective modulus, Composite Structures, 291, (2022); Yao, Yongtao, Fabrication and characterization of shape memory auxetic metamaterial, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 34, 1, pp. 101-110, (2023); Liu, Yuheng, 3D printing shape memory polymer of laminated multi-component metamaterial towards optimization of auxetic and shape recovery behaviors, Smart Materials and Structures, 32, 2, (2023)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

While integrating holes for connections and sensors is common, it can compromise structural integrity, making it essential to understand their impact on energy absorption and load-bearing efficiency. Despite prior research on CFRP crashworthiness, the interaction between PUF insertion and hole patterns in rectangular tubes remains underexplored. This study addresses that gap by analyzing how these combined parameters affect specific energy absorption (SEA), crush force efficiency (CFE), and progressive failure modes. A quasi-static axial compression test was conducted to evaluate the specific energy absorption (SEA) and crush force efficiency (CFE). The Taguchi method was applied to analyze four factors: hole diameter, PUF filling, and the number of holes in the x- and y-directions. Taguchi analysis combined with Grey relation analysis was performed to optimize the multi-response outputs simultaneously. The mono-response Taguchi analysis indicates that hole diameter has the greatest influence on the SEA value; meanwhile, PUF-filling has the highest effect on the CFE value. Based on the Taguchi-Grey relational analysis, the optimal configuration consists of an 8 mm hole diameter, PUF filling, two holes in the x-direction, and one hole in the y-direction. This optimization was confirmed through testing, with results showing a SEA of 24 J/g and a CFE of 0.62, slightly lower in SEA and higher in CFE than the neat PUF-filled tubes (26 J/g and 0.57, respectively). © 2025","Crush force efficiency (CFE); Quasi-static crushing test; Specific energy absorption (SEA); Taguchi method; Thin-walled structure","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Compaction; Crashworthiness; Failure modes; Honeycomb structures; Rigid foamed plastics; Structural dynamics; Crush force efficiency; Crushing test; Polyurethane Foam; Quasi-static crushing; Quasi-static crushing test; Specific energy absorption; Taguchi's methods; Thin-walled structures; Compression testing","Crashworthiness of Transportation Systems Structural Impact and Occupant Protection, (2012); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Mohan Kumar, K.

Nevertheless, the related strategy of coupling design between two honeycombs is still limited, and the coupling mechanical behavior still needs further clarification. This work proposes a type of coupling-designed honeycombs (CDH) by a non-contact interweaving combination strategy. The crushing properties of the CDH under different patterns of dual-Poisson's ratios are systematically investigated, in which the honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR) and positive Poisson's ratio (ZPR) are considered. Results demonstrate that the coupling effect highly depends on the patterns of dual-Poisson's ratios. When the NPR mode is present, the coupling effect exhibits a distinct improvement. By inducing the change in mesoscopic deformation mechanisms and enhancing the densification effect, the coupling effect can remarkably enhance the crushing strength and specific energy absorption (SEA). Especially, the SEA of the CDH with dual-NPR pattern is 362.53 % higher than the traditional RE honeycomb. Furthermore, an optimization analysis considering SEA and initial peak stress is carried out, which confirms that the CDH with the dual-NPR pattern shows the best overall performance. This work helps to clarify the coupling mechanical behaviors of the CDH with multi-pattern dual-Poisson's ratios and provides valuable insights for the development of novel lightweight materials. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Coupling design; Crushing properties; Dual-Poisson's ratios; Honeycombs; Interweaving combination; Negative Poisson's ratio","Honeycomb structures; Coupling designs; Coupling effect; Crushing property; Dual-poisson ratio; Honeycomb; Interweaving combination; Multi patterns; Negative Poisson ratio; Property; Specific energy absorption; Poisson ratio","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Li, Youjian, Material extrusion of quaternary co-continuous biopolymers: A strategy for realizing lightweight cellular solids with high impact toughness, Additive Manufacturing, 77, (2023); Huang, Li, Analytical homogenization for equivalent in-plane elastic moduli of multi-material honeycombs, Composite Structures, 325, (2023); Montgomery-Liljeroth, Ebba, Elastic properties of 2D auxetic honeycomb structures- a review, Applied Materials Today, 30, (2023); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Ha, Ngoc-san, Thin-walled corrugated structures: A review of crashworthiness designs and energy absorption characteristics, Thin-Walled Structures, 157, (2020); Zhong, Jianlin, Mechanical behaviors of composite auxetic structures under quasi-static compression and dynamic impact, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 109, (2025); Qiao, Jinxiu, Impact resistance of uniform and functionally graded auxetic double arrowhead honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 83, pp. 47-58, (2015); Lv, Weitao, Study on blast resistance of a composite sandwich panel with isotropic foam core with negative Poisson's ratio, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 191, (2021); Hou, Wenbinw Bin, Crashworthiness optimization of crash box with 3D-printed lattice structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 247, (2023)",""

This study focuses on developing and assessing a novel nested honeycomb-gyroid hybrid lattice structure to improve crashworthiness performance across multiple loading directions. Three lattice structures with honeycomb, gyroid, and hybrid honeycomb-gyroid nested unit cells were designed with 30 % relative density and fabricated using Laser Powder Bed Fusion. Various energy absorption indicators were evaluated by performing compression tests in three mutually perpendicular directions (D1, D2, D3) under both quasi-static and high-strain-rate conditions. The hybrid structure exhibited the highest mean crushing force of 41.07 kN in the in-plane direction under high-strain-rate loading. Results reveal that the in-plane compression of the hybrid structure exhibits a mechanical response with uniform stress distribution and the out-of-plane compression results in improved load-bearing ability and energy absorption. A higher high-strain-rate crash force efficiency value of 76.05 % is exhibited by the gyroid structure when loaded along the out-of-plane direction, and 54.28 % along the in-plane direction; however, the hybrid structure offered a uniform mechanical response in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The hybrid structure (HGLS) outperforms the parent structures in terms of specific energy absorption under high-strain-rate loading across all directions due to the complex interactions between the overlapping geometries, thereby resulting in improved energy absorption. This highlights the significance of novel nested design in the enhancement of the multi-directional energy absorption performance of cellular structures. © 2025 The Authors.

The increasing demand for metamaterial structures with diverse specialized attributes requires innovative design approaches. In this study, a novel bi-material triangular curved beam honeycomb metamaterial (BTBM) is designed, which exhibits a tunable Poisson’s ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and band gap characteristics. These properties are intrinsically coupled through the geometric and material design of the bi-material triangular curved beam structure, meaning that adjustments to the unit cell configuration simultaneously influence PR, CTE, and band gap behavior. This dual-mode control offers versatile design strategies for multifunctional metamaterials. The energy band structure is calculated using finite element simulation analysis, and its accuracy is validated by computing the transmission characteristic curve. Numerical simulations were performed to systematically analyze the coupled effects of geometric parameters and material combinations on the PR and CTE.

Meanwhile, the material properties of SMA result in a design constraint that the local strain in energy-absorbing structures cannot exceed the certain limit, so the problem of maximizing the overall structure's energy absorption while limitation of local recoverable strain needs to be addressed. This study proposes a non-concurrent honeycomb structure (NHS) with curved substructures. By effectively controlling the local material's strain level, NHS maximizes specific energy absorption (SEA) while utilizing SMA recoverability for reusable energy absorption. The quasi-static compression and impact tests were progressively tested and analyzed to investigate the energy absorption characteristics, shape recovery laws, and influence of failure strain of NHS. The experimental results combined with parametric analysis demonstrate that NHS can effectively control the local strain, and the shape recovery rate after five cycles of compression-heating recovery is above 90 %. Despite the presence of localized fractures, the impact sample can still exhibit a high level of shape recovery rate at a higher structural compression ratio.

The developed data-driven optimization design framework integrates deep neural network models and genetic algorithms, enabling the generation of novel BSHs that fulfill specific design criteria.

Additionally, empirical equations to compute the maximum initial peaking compression force, mean compression force, and specific energy absorption of BSHs at specific relative densities were summarized. These optimized BSHs were categorized into bowl-shaped BSHs, 30-sided BSHs, 5-shaped BSHs, 2-shaped BSHs, M-shaped BSHs, and r-shaped BSHs based on their topological structures. The BSH with the highest specific energy absorption, 13.4 J/g, belonged to the 5-shaped BSHs category, with a corresponding relative density of 9.15 %. The predominant deformation mode for these optimized BSHs, ensuring maximal material utilization, was identified as perfect folding mode. Compared to traditional hexagonal honeycomb and other polyline/curve hexagonal configurations at equivalent relative densities, the BSHs exhibited superior energy absorption capabilities. This study offers a systematic design approach for future endeavors aimed at developing high energy absorbing honeycombs with more intricate cross-sectional shapes. © 2025","Empirical equation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb; Machine learning; Optimization design","Deep neural networks; Honeycomb structures; Machine design; Sandwich structures; Splines; B splines; Data-driven optimization; Empirical equations; Energy; Energy absorption capability; Honeycomb; Machine-learning; Optimization design; Relative density; Specific energy absorption; Bulk Density","Shifa, Madni, Mechanical and electrical properties of hybrid honeycomb sandwich structure for spacecraft structural applications, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 1, pp. 222-240, (2021); Ganilova, Olga A., Experimental investigation of the thermoelastic performance of an aerospace aluminium honeycomb composite panel, Composite Structures, 257, (2021); Goyal, Vinay K., Proof test methodology for reducing the risk of unvented honeycomb core failures in aerospace structures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 25, 1, pp. 61-76, (2023); Hou, Wenbinw Bin, Study on mechanical properties of carbon fiber honeycomb curved sandwich structure and its application in engine hood, Composite Structures, 286, (2022); Upadhyaya, Shravan, Synthesis and characterization of honeycomb sandwiched composite material for automobile applications, Materials Today: Proceedings, 54, pp. 502-506, (2021); Amraei, Mohsen, Application of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panel as an energy absorber of high-speed train nose, Journal of Composite Materials, 48, 9, pp. 1027-1037, (2014); Garbatov, Yordan Y., Flexural response of additive-manufactured honeycomb sandwiches for marine structural applications, Ocean Engineering, 302, (2024); He, Yinchuan, Design and mechanical properties analysis of hexagonal perforated honeycomb metamaterial, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 270, (2024); Deng, Yun, Dual-Phase Inspired Soft Electronic Sensors with Programmable and Tunable Mechanical Properties, ACS Nano, 17, 7, pp. 6423-6434, (2023); Guo, Yanfeng, Shock absorbing characteristics and vibration transmissibility of honeycomb paperboard, Shock and Vibration, 11, 5-6, pp. 521-531, (2004)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

It examines the evolution of bumper technology from steel structures to advanced composites, analyzing their impact on vehicle performance and crash safety. The research evaluates various materials for bumper components, including aluminium alloys, ABS plastics, carbon fiber-reinforced plastics for the body, and expanded polypropylene and polyethylene foam for energy absorbers. The study simulates bumper performance under low-velocity impact conditions using computer-aided design and finite element analysis. Three energy absorption geometries-triangular, diamond, and honeycomb structures-are assessed for crash scenarios. The paper highlights trade-offs between design complexity, manufacturing considerations, and energy absorption performance. This comprehensive study contributes to the understanding of bumper design optimization, material selection, and performance evaluation, offering valuable insights for automotive engineers developing next-generation vehicle safety systems. The main findings indicate that ABS polymer is the best material for bumper bodies because it offers the best impact resistance and the least amount of deformation while achieving significant weight reduction as compared to conventional materials. Although production difficulty must be taken into account, the best strength absorption and deformation characteristics in electricity absorber design are shown by the hexagonal cross-sectional shape in vertical orientation. While polyethylene foam performs well in prolonged impact situations, expanded polypropylene is more effective for initial impact absorption in power absorbers, indicating the possibility of hybrid solutions in future designs. © 2025, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

In this paper, the quasi-static compression experiments of thin-walled square tube filled with foam aluminum and foam aluminum are carried out respectively, and analyze its deformation process and stress-strain changes. According to the shape and size of holes randomly and irregularly arranged in porous foam aluminum, the two-dimensional random distribution model of gradient foam aluminum material was established by Digimat and filled into a square tube. Ansys is used to simulate the quasi-static compression and impact of thin-walled square tube filled with gradient foam aluminum. The validity and validity of the two-dimensional random distribution model are proved by comparing the experimental and simulation results. The results show that under the same impact displacement, the energy absorption effect of gradient foam aluminum square tube is better than that of homogeneous foam aluminum square tube of the same mass. In order to further improve the impact resistance of foam aluminum square tube, so that its pressure can be evenly distributed and transferred to other parts of the tube, the energy absorption and peak stress are taken as optimization objectives, and a multi-objective optimization model of gradient foam aluminum filling structure is established.

Currently, research on the reusability of SMP-based metamaterials is limited, particularly regarding the influence of cellular unit geometries on their recovery performance, which remains unclear. To address this gap, this study combines typical cellular units with positive, negative, and zero Poisson's ratio properties into various structures. Through quasi-static compression experiments, complemented by three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) technology and finite element analysis, the mechanical compression performance and deformation mechanisms of the three structures are compared in detail.

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb structures. However, most of the existing researches focus on the gradient design of traditional honeycomb structures, and the gradient design of new structures needs to be further studied. Compared with the traditional honeycomb, the sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure has better energy absorption capacity, compressive strength and bending strength, and also has excellent performance in sound insulation and shock absorption. Therefore, this paper takes the sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure as the research object. Materials and Methods: In order to further improve the dynamic response of honeycomb structures under in-plane impact, numerical simulation, experimental verification and multi-objective optimization design are adopted in this paper. Firstly, the sine curve is introduced into the negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure. The gradient layer number of the cellular structure was fixed, and the sinusoidal negative Poisson ratio cellular structure was established with the amplitude, period and cell wall thickness of the sinusoidal curve as the gradient. Under multivelocit conditions, the sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio cell structures of the non-gradient (NG-CM), amplitude gradient (AG-CM), periodic gradient (PG-CM), and wall thickness gradient (WTG-CM) was simulated and analyzed for comparison. Secondly, according to the theory of multicellular materials, a formula for calculating the relative density of honeycomb structures with negative Poisson's ratio of sinusoidal curves is established. The relationship between cell parameters, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio is derived by taking a single cell with sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio as the analysis target. Thirdly, the NG-CM specimen was made by metal 3D printer and the quasi-static compression test was carried out. The test results were compared with the simulation results, and the reliability of the finite element simulation results was verified. Forthly, the number of gradient layers of the honeycomb structure is changed. AG-CM, PG-CM and WTG-CM with two gradient layers, four gradient layers and six gradient layers were established respectively, and their buffering energy absorption characteristics were simulated by ABAQUS under multi-velocity conditions. Finally, NSGA-II algorithm based on random forest is used to optimize the gradient sinusoidal honeycomb structure. The amplitude gradient value and wall thickness gradient value of the honeycomb structure are taken as design variables, and the PCF and SEA generated by the honeycomb structure in the face of impact are taken as optimization targets. In order to verify the accuracy of the optimization results, a simulation model was established and the impact simulation was carried out through the gradient values corresponding to the two groups of optimization values. The error between the optimization results and the simulation results was within 5%, which met the requirements of the optimization design. The innovation of this paper is that the AG-CM, PG-CM, WTG-CM honeycomb structure based on sine curve is proposed, and then the negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure is proposed with layer gradient. The research in this paper revealed the relationship between gradient setting, impact mode, gradient layer number, PCF and SEA of sinusoidal gradient negative Poisson’s ratio honeycomb structure, which provided a prerequisite for quantitative analysis when considering the specific application situation. It will provide a new design idea for the multi-objective optimization of the impact dynamic performance of honeycomb structures. Conclusion: The results show that WTG-CM has the lowest PCF and the highest specific absorption energy (SEA) under low velocity (7 m/s) impact. In the face of positive gradient impact (PGI) at medium and high speed (35 m/s, 70 m/s), the buffering and energy absorption characteristics of AG-CM are better than other honeycomb structures. WTG-CM has the lowest PCF and the highest SEA when facing the inverse gradient shock (NGI). The smaller the number of gradient layers, the more obvious the densification is. The honeycomb structure produces plastic deformation in regions with low relative density. The difference of compaction strain between gradient layers decreases with the increase of the number of gradient layers. According to the actual demand, two groups of optimization values are selected from a series of optimization solutions. The PCF of optimization value 1 is reduced by 64.9% compared with NG-CM, and the SEA of optimization value 2 is increased by 22.2% compared with NG-CM, showing obvious optimization effect. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Energy absorption; Functional gradient; Honeycomb structures; In-plane impact; Negative Poisson's ratio","","Int J Impact Eng, (2004); Bian, Yijie, Deformation mode and energy absorption of polycrystal-inspired square-cell lattice structures, Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (English Edition), 41, 10, pp. 1561-1582, (2020); Wang, Tao, A novel 3D impact energy absorption structure with negative Poisson's ratio and its application in aircraft crashworthiness, Composite Structures, 262, (2021); Zhang, Jianxun, Low-velocity impact of rectangular foam-filled fiber metal laminate tubes, Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (English Edition), 42, 12, pp. 1733-1742, (2021); Dalela, Srajan, A review on application of mechanical metamaterials for vibration control, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 22, pp. 3237-3262, (2022); Linforth, Steven, Investigation of the auxetic oval structure for energy absorption through quasi-static and dynamic experiments, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 147, (2021); Lu, Huan, In-plane dynamics crushing of a combined auxetic honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 160, (2021); Menon, Hrishikesh G., Proposed auxetic cluster designs for lightweight structural beams with improved load bearing capacity, Engineering Structures, 260, (2022); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic indentation of auxetic and non-auxetic honeycombs under large deformation, Composite Structures, 207, pp. 323-330, (2019); Jiang, Hongyong, Crashworthiness of novel concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio biologically inspired by coconut palm, Thin-Walled Structures, 154, (2020)",""

The design of protective structures that meet the complex requirements of real-world environments and combine excellent mechanical performance with lightweight characteristics is becoming increasingly important. This study proposes a blast protection sandwich structure incorporating an elliptical annular re-entrant (EARE) honeycomb. A validated numerical model was used to investigate the response behavior of EARE honeycomb sandwich panels under explosive loading. The explosive response process of EARE honeycomb sandwich panels was divided into three phases. In the first and second phase, the elliptical ring structures in the cells provided support to the faceplate and diagonal ribs, restricting further collapse of the cells and overall deflection of the sandwich panel. This enhanced the explosive protection performance of EARE honeycomb sandwich panels. The study also parametrically investigated the explosive protection performance of EARE honeycomb sandwich panels under different design and loading variables. The results indicate that under larger explosive loads, the honeycomb core and backplate play a more significant role in the explosive protection performance of the sandwich panel. Increasing the stiffness of the sandwich panel by changing design variables reduces the maximum residual deflection (MaxD) while decreasing the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the sandwich panel. Finally, to balance the explosive protection performance and mass of EARE honeycomb sandwich panels, a multi-objective optimization was conducted.

Honeycomb plates, known for their lightweight and high strength, are extensively used in aerospace, transportation, and architecture. This study presents a novel biomimetic helicoidal honeycomb plate (HHP) that combines the benefits of both these structures. By varying cell geometries (15, 12.5, 10, and 7.5 mm) and helicoidal angles (0°, 60°, 120°, and 180°), the mechanical response of the HHP to blast loadings is examined. Results indicate that the helicoidal angle significantly improves blast resistance. Specifically, the 180° helicoidal angle with 15 and 12.5 mm cell geometries provides the highest blast resistance, while the 120° angle performs best for 10 mm cells and the 0° angle for 7.5 mm cells. To achieve optimal blast resistance, balancing rigidity and toughness is essential. Increasing the helicoidal angle improves blast resistance, especially in structures with lower rigidity. These insights are crucial for the design of advanced protective structures, offering valuable guidance for blast and impact protection in the fields of protective and safety engineering. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Biomimetic design; Blast resistance; Energy absorption; Helicoidal angle optimization; Helicoidal honeycomb plate; Sandwich structures","Honeycomb structures; Rigidity; Biomimetic design; Blast loading; Cell geometries; Energy; Fibre structure; Helicoidal angle optimization; Helicoidal honeycomb plate; High-strength; Mechanical response; Optimisations; Sandwich structures","Denny, Jack W., A numerical investigation of blast-structure interaction effects on primary blast injury risk and the suitability of existing injury prediction methods, International Journal of Protective Structures, 15, 1, pp. 3-22, (2024); Patel, Murlidhar, Blast analysis of efficient honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP/Steel FML skins, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 178, (2023); Zhang, Tianhui, Elastic-plastic response for the foam-filled sandwich circular tube under internal blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 188, (2024); Wanchoo, Piyush, Advances in naval composite and sandwich structures for blast and implosion mitigations, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 26, 2, pp. 152-174, (2024); Zhang, Lu, Bending behavior of lightweight C/SiC pyramidal lattice core sandwich panels, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 171, (2020); Comput Concrete, (2020); Zoumaki, Maria, Mechanical Characterization and Finite Element Analysis of Hierarchical Sandwich Structures with PLA 3D-Printed Core and Composite Maize Starch Biodegradable Skins, Journal of Composites Science, 6, 4, (2022); undefined, (2024); Qin, Zhiwen, In-plane compressive strength and failure behaviors of composite sandwich structures for wind turbine blades, Engineering Failure Analysis, 159, (2024); Ren, Jianwei, Enhancing impact resistance of metallic foam core sandwich constructions through encasing high-strength fibrous composites, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024)",""

Additionally, an optimization study of the infill pattern (IP) was conducted using the Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. The study showed that the compressive behavior of the examined parts is similar to cellular materials (e.g., foams) and varies based on the IP, exhibiting brittle, quasi-brittle, or ductile fracture modes. The highest compressive modulus (745.35 MPa) and compressive strength (33.95 MPa) were observed for the Hilbert Curve IP, while the lowest values were recorded for the Lightning IP. Honeycomb IP presented the best energy absorption performance (16.65 MJ/m3), whereas Lightning IP had the lowest (0.14 MJ/m3). In terms of specific properties, Star IP was found as the most efficient, owing to its lightweight design, outperforming other IPs. Considering conventional and specific compressive properties through the MCDA method, Star IP was identified as the optimal pattern across three key criteria: “stiffness-driven”, “strength-driven”, and “energy absorption-driven” structures.

The results show that foam filling increases the energy absorption and specific energy absorption of the orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel by 64.75% and 38.22% under compressive load, respectively. Furthermore, during compression, the filled foam causes the core strut undergo pure buckling failure and gradually folds rather than brittle fracture. Under low-velocity impact, the strengthening effect of foam filling on the first peak load of the load–displacement of the orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel decreases with the increase of impact energy, while the inhibition effect on the impactor drop increases with the increase of impact energy. The results can provide a reference for the design and optimization of foam-filled hybrid sandwich structures. Highlights: The compressive property and low-velocity impact resistance of the foam-filled orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel are tested. The effect of foam filling on the mechanical properties of the orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel is obtained by comparing the out-of-plane compressive response and low-velocity impact response of the empty and foam-filled orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel and foam sandwich panel.

A specific folding pattern was applied to the honeycomb to create the origami-based re-entrant honeycomb (ORH), aimed at improving the energy absorption properties of the sandwich structure. The study on the energy absorption properties of structures under low-velocity impact (LVI) utilized both experimental and numerical approaches. The energy absorption properties of the sandwich structure were examined by conducting LVI tests with different impact energy and then compared to the mechanical properties of the traditional re-entrant honeycomb sandwich structures (TRHSS). Additionally, a refined finite element model has been established and its accuracy verified. Numerical studies were conducted to explore the effects of structural parameters on the energy absorption properties of ORH sandwich structure (ORHSS). The results show that the ORHSS exhibited a significant reduction in peak force when subjected to LVI, in contrast to the TRHSS. Furthermore, the ORHSS exhibit significant efficiency in energy absorption. Enhancing the wall thickness (Formula presented.) or folding angle (Formula presented.) can significantly improve the energy absorption properties of the ORHSS, thereby boosting the honeycomb's contribution to this process. This optimization results in an improved absorptive effect of the structure. The findings offer new recommendations for developing lightweight absorbent materials with potential applications across various industries. Highlights: A novel composite sandwich structure serves as an efficient device for absorbing energy. This sandwich structure exhibits excellent cushioning and energy absorption capabilities. Changing geometric parameters can enhance the impact performance of the structure. A larger folding angle (Formula presented.) makes the core more prone to deformation. The greater the forward length (Formula presented.) of the ORH, the lower specific energy absorption (SEA) of the ORHSS. © 2024 Society of Plastics Engineers.","composites; finite element analysis (FEA); low-velocity impact; sandwich panel","Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; A: Honeycomb; Energy absorption properties; Experimental approaches; Finite element analyse; Finite element analyze; Folding patterns; Foldings; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Low velocity impact; Sandwich panel; Sandwich structures","Wang, Meng, Quasi-static three-point bending of sandwich panels with Miura-ori cores, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 268, (2024); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Acanfora, Valerio, Experimental investigation on 3D printed lightweight sandwich structures for energy absorption aerospace applications, Aerospace Science and Technology, 137, (2023); Zhang, Chao, Damage in hybrid corrugated core sandwich structures under high velocity hail ice impact: A numerical study, Defence Technology, 27, pp. 217-236, (2023); Zhang, Wei, Deformation and failure of hybrid composite sandwich beams with a metal foam core under quasi-static load and low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 242, (2020); Langdon, Genevieve S., The response of honeycomb core sandwich panels, with aluminum and composite face sheets, to blast loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 12, 6, pp. 733-754, (2010); Guo, Haoyuan, Review of sandwich structures under impact loadings: Experimental, numerical and theoretical analysis, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024); Lv, Hangyu, Low-velocity impact response of composite sandwich structure with grid–honeycomb hybrid core, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 246, (2023); Xue, Xinwei, Study on the impact resistance of honeycomb sandwich structures under low-velocity/heavy mass, Composite Structures, 226, (2019); Duan, Yuechen, Mechanical characteristics of composite honeycomb sandwich structures under oblique impact, Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters, 12, 5, (2022)",""

In electric vehicle (EV) design, the body surrounding the battery must effectively absorb impact, especially during crashes. This study aims to improve the crash performance of the side profiles in the battery box of an M1 category vehicle. It is based on the crash test in Annex 8D of the ECE R100 regulation. In this study, the safe displacement at which the battery will not deform is set as 20 mm, and the maximum force and energy absorption at this displacement are compared. In total, 33 different electric and hybrid vehicle models were benchmarked in this study. L-shaped geometry and aluminum materials are generally preferred; this study focuses on using glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) pultruded profiles to make batteries more durable and lighter. The GF800 material was selected for its superior mechanical strength among glass fiber composites. A virtual tensile test verified its properties. A unique hybrid model combining honeycomb and auxetic geometries was developed, showing a crash performance improvement of ~360% over honeycomb structures and ~88% over auxetic structures. Through multi-objective optimization using artificial neural networks (ANNs), 27 models were analyzed, leading to an optimized design. The final design resulted in the battery box side profile being 23.9% lighter and 38.6% cheaper, and exhibiting a performance 3% higher.

This study drew inspiration from natural structures and started from the structural form. By utilizing dual bio-inspired characteristics from turtle shell support and honeycomb structure, a novel honeycomb hyperbolic bio-inspired strut (HHBS) structure was designed. Five fractal configurations were created by varying the strut angle, and their energy absorption capabilities and deformation modes were analyzed through numerical simulation and quasi-static compression experiment. The analysis results indicated that the 150°HHBS structure performed best. Based on this finding, the 150°HHBS structure was further strengthened by modifying part of the circular column struts into oblate column struts, enabling adjacent single cells within the lattice structure to form multi-cell structures through shared struts. This improvement minimized the increase in mass, resulting in a new honeycomb hyperbolic bio-inspired strut optimization (HHBSO) structure. The study results demonstrated that the HHBSO structure further improved the energy absorption capability of bio-inspired lattice structures. With the application and advancement of additive manufacturing technology, the manufacturing of dual bio-inspired lattice structures with high mechanical efficiency and lightweight characteristics is possible, which has significant implications for the research and development of energy absorption structures. © 2024 The Authors","Bio-inspired design; Energy absorption; Laser powder bed fusion; Lattice structure; Structure strengthening","Crystal lattices; Structural analysis; Struts; Bio-inspired designs; Energy; Energy absorption capability; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Optimisations; Powder bed; Structure strengthening; Structure-based; Honeycomb structures","Bhat, Chinmai, Design, fabrication, and properties evaluation of novel nested lattice structures, Additive Manufacturing, 68, (2023); Li, Qiqi, Parametric analysis on axial compression performance of bio-inspired porous lattice structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Liu, Jianxing, Imperfection sensitivity of mechanical properties in soft network materials with horseshoe microstructures, Acta Mechanica Sinica/Lixue Xuebao, 37, 7, pp. 1050-1062, (2021); Pei, Xuan, Bionic mechanical design of titanium bone tissue implants and 3D printing manufacture, Materials Letters, 208, pp. 133-137, (2017); Son, Karen N., Design of multifunctional lattice-frame materials for compact heat exchangers, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 115, pp. 619-629, (2017); Liu, Jie, On sound insulation of pyramidal lattice sandwich structure, Composite Structures, 208, pp. 385-394, (2019); Qin, Haoxing, Vibration reduction design method of metamaterials with negative Poisson’s ratio, Journal of Materials Science, 54, 22, pp. 14038-14054, (2019); Ramakrishna, Doodi, Compression behavior of bio-inspired lattice structures inspired by Papilio Xuthus, Materials Today: Proceedings, 90, pp. 184-187, (2023); Rahmani, Ramin, Lightweight 3D printed Ti6Al4V-AlSi10Mg hybrid composite for impact resistance and armor piercing shielding, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 9, 6, pp. 13842-13854, (2020); Leary, Martin John, Selective laser melting (SLM) of AlSi12Mg lattice structures, Materials and Design, 98, pp. 344-357, (2016)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

One to three levels of sandwich composite are prepared with a rectangular core configuration by keeping the specimen’s constant dimensions. A second multilevel sandwich composite sample set is developed with hexagonal, square, and triangular core configurations, maintaining length, width, height, and weight constant. The developed composite samples are characterized by their compressive properties. For single, double, and triple-level sandwich composites with rectangular cores, it is found that increasing the number of levels led to an increase in compressive load capacity, with triple-level structures exhibiting the highest strength. However, an increase in the number of levels resulted in a decrease in specific compressive load. Additionally, the energy absorption capacity increases as the number of levels increases. In the case of multilevel sandwich composites with triangular, square, and hexagonal core, the triangular core demonstrated the highest compressive strength and energy absorption capacity compared to square and hexagonal configurations. The failure modes of the sandwich composite structure have also been discussed. The results indicate that the sandwich composite’s compressive, energy absorption properties, and failure modes depend on many parameters, such as the number of levels, core structure, free wall length, face sheet length, and loading direction. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into potential applications and performance of these advanced sandwich structures, enabling improved design and optimization for specific engineering applications across diverse industries. © The Author(s) 2024.","cell geometry; compression property; energy absorption; hollow composite; multilevel structure; Sandwich structure","Compressive strength; Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization; Cell geometries; Composites structures; Compression properties; Core configuration; Energy; Hollow composite; Multi-level structures; Multilevels; Rectangular core; Sandwich composites; Sandwich structures","Karsandik, Yasin, Impact behavior of sandwich composites for aviation applications: A review, Composite Structures, 314, (2023); Öztemiz, Hasan Murat, Experimental and FEM investigation of bending behaviors of S-core sandwich panel composites, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 286-287, (2024); Safaei, Babak, Frequency-dependent damped vibrations of multifunctional foam plates sandwiched and integrated by composite faces, European Physical Journal Plus, 136, 6, (2021); Rao, Rui, Isogeometric nonlinear bending analysis of porous FG composite microplates with a central cutout modeled by the couple stress continuum quasi-3D plate theory, Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, 21, 3, (2021); Fotsing, Édith Roland, Mechanical properties of composite sandwich structures with core or face sheet discontinuities, Composites Part B: Engineering, 88, pp. 229-239, (2016); Pan, Xin, Low-velocity impact response of thermoplastic composite sandwich panels with the intersected corrugated core, Composite Structures, 324, (2023); Ghanati, Parisa, Elastic buckling analysis of polygonal thin sheets under compression, Indian Journal of Physics, 93, 1, pp. 47-52, (2019); Ding, Zhe, Multi-scale topological design of asymmetric porous sandwich structures with unidentical face sheets and composite core, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 422, (2024); Kumar, Anil, Analysis of effects of varying face sheet thickness on different properties of composite sandwich Structure, Materials Today: Proceedings, 38, pp. 116-121, (2020); Wang, Pengtao, Surface stress size dependency in nonlinear free oscillations of FGM quasi-3D nanoplates having arbitrary shapes with variable thickness using IGA, Thin-Walled Structures, 166, (2021)",""

However, for design optimization, the computational challenges posed by simulating extensive structures featuring lattice cells demand an exponential increase in degrees of freedom, inevitably prolonging computational time. The present work addresses some of the challenges in simulating these structures by employing numerical homogenization and investigating the effective elastic properties, aiming to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The homogenization approach is validated using experiments on lattice structures made in polymer. The study also evaluates the applicability of existing analytical models by comparing their predictions with numerical homogenization results. A comprehensive analysis considering the structural parameters, namely re-entrant angle (θ) and relative density (ρ<inf>rel</inf>), is presented to understand the prediction accuracy of different analytical models. Both uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the influence of these structural parameters on the effective properties and to assess the variability due to probable geometric uncertainties introduced in manufacturing. Additionally, the influence of cell density on the homogenization model’s accuracy is also examined. The findings reveal good agreement between the lattice simulation, the homogenized model, and the experimental result within the linear elastic limit. The study infers that amongst the analytical models, Malek’s model is highly accurate for predicting E<inf>11</inf>, E<inf>33</inf>, and Poisson’s ratio μ<inf>12</inf> for higher θ and up to 30% ρ<inf>rel</inf> but shows significant deviations for G<inf>12</inf>, G<inf>23</inf>, and μ<inf>23</inf>, necessitating numerical homogenization for higher accuracy beyond these ranges. The uncertainty analysis indicates that elastic moduli such as E<inf>11</inf>/E<inf>s</inf> and E<inf>33</inf>/E<inf>s</inf> exhibit the highest sensitivity to variations in strut thickness and angle, highlighting the need for precise manufacturing control to mitigate variability in effective elastic properties. The sensitivity analysis revealed that strut thickness (t) significantly influences the elastic and shear moduli, while the interaction of θ and t plays a crucial role in determining Poisson’s ratios for the auxetic honeycomb lattice. Additionally, numerical homogenization effectively predicts the elastic properties of re-entrant honeycomb structures with higher accuracy and lower computational costs. This comprehensive analysis enhances the understanding and practical application of both analytical and numerical methods in lattice structure design. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Elastic properties; Finite element method; Homogenization; Re-entrant honeycomb lattice","Failure rate; Homogenization method; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Sensitivity analysis; Shape optimization; Shear strain; Stress relief; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Struts; Comprehensive analysis; Computational costs; Effective elastic property; Elastic properties; Element method; Homogenization; Honeycomb lattices; Lattice structures; Numerical Homogenisation; Re-entrant honeycomb lattice; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","Alwattar, Tahseen A., Developing an equivalent solid material model for bcc lattice cell structures involving vertical and horizontal struts, Journal of Composites Science, 4, 2, (2020); Computational Elasticity, (2005); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Barbero, Ever J., Finite Element Analysis of Composite Materials using Abaqus®, Second Edition, pp. 1-572, (2023); Carneiro, Vítor Hugo Pimenta, Significance of cell number on the bulk elastic properties of auxetic reentrant lattices, Science and Technology of Materials, 30, 1, pp. 8-12, (2018); Catapano, Anita, A multi-scale approach for the optimum design of sandwich plates with honeycomb core.

This research adopted a structured sequence of steps to integrate desired aircrew helmet properties. The study involved the analysis of 3D woven structural composites through quasistatic compression and dynamic impact tests to assess their compressive strength and impact energy properties, respectively. Initially, the study focuses on optimizing the honeycomb liner by adjusting its structural parameters to improve the compressive strength. The research then delved into the critical role of impact energy, aiming to enhance load transfer to the liner for maximal impact energy absorption. Key findings highlight that the L2T2H3 honeycomb liner configuration, when combined with the OR8L3M shell, significantly improves the protective performance by exhibiting superior impact energy, cushioning properties, and compressive strength. Factors such as weave architecture, impactor geometry, impactor velocity, and face sheet thickness were found to influence the energy absorption capacity, emphasizing the importance of structural design optimization. The combined use of helmet shell and liner components demonstrated superior energy absorption capabilities compared to individual components.

In this paper, the quasi-static compression experiments of traditional hexagonal aluminum honeycomb structures with different apertures are carried out under axial load. The stress-strain curves and deformation modes are analyzed, the specific energy absorption of the structure is calculated, and the influence of the aperture on the energy absorption characteristics is determined. Based on the hybrid strategy, five new bionic honeycomb structures evolved from the traditional hexagonal honeycomb structure were designed, and a quasi-static compression simulation model was established for the new bionic honeycomb structure. The reliability of the simulation model was verified by the experimental results. The results showed that the energy absorption characteristics of the five new bionic honeycomb structures were superior to the traditional hexagonal honeycomb structures. Among them, Hg type bionic honeycomb structure has the best energy absorption characteristics, and its specific energy absorption is 16.93 J/g. Using the sensitivity analysis method, it was determined that the wall thickness t and the aperture ρ had the greatest influence on energy absorption. A mathematical optimization model was established, and NSGA-II algorithm was used to solve the Pareto optimal front solution to determine the optimal optimization scheme.

In this work, four typical honeycomb structures were prepared, and the mechanical behaviors, shape recovery effects, and energy absorption properties of three types of auxetic honeycomb structures re-entrant honeycomb (RH), arrow honeycomb (AH), and star honeycomb (SH) were compared with those of hexagonal honeycomb (HH) through quasi-static loading–unloading tests. The findings indicate that the 3D printed polyurethane (TPU) honeycomb structures demonstrate robust shape recovery, stable energy absorption, notable stress softening characteristics. The recovery behaviors can be characterized by three distinct phases, namely hyperelastic, transitional, and viscoelastic. The unit configuration significantly influences the shape recovery capability, with apparent elastic modulus and stability of the energy absorption efficiency determining the overall shape recovery capability. The loading method also affects the energy absorption and dissipation patterns in different honeycomb structures. In terms of specific energy absorption (SEA), AH has the highest rating, with RH and SH at 86 % and 50 % of the SEA of AH respectively. The number of reusable cycles is primarily dictated by the specific configuration of the unit type. In scenarios involving reusability, the energy absorption capacity of the TPU honeycomb can only reach 70 % of its original energy absorption capacity.

To assess its performance effectively, the study established the 3D equivalent Cauchy model (3D-ECM) and 2D equivalent Kirchhoff–Love model (2D-EKM) using the variational asymptotic method. The equivalent properties derived from the unit-cell constitutive model were integrated into the equivalent models for macroscopic analysis. Through 3D printing experiments and numerical simulations, the model's accuracy in predicting the compression behaviors and auxetic effects of various uni- and multi-cellular ERHs under uniaxial compression, as well as the three-point bending behaviors of ERH panels were confirmed. In addition, this model substantially simplifies the modeling process, leading to a 8-fold increase in computational efficiency. Parametric analyses demonstrated that the ERH structure can uphold a beneficial auxetic effect while achieving lightweight and high strength characteristics when the axial ratio of the ellipse equals 1.25. Furthermore, ERH structures outperform arc-shaped re-entrant and regular re-entrant honeycombs in energy absorption and specific energy absorption capacity.

One effective solution is the adoption of lightweight structures in vehicle design. Cellular structures, known for their lightweight and energy absorption properties, are highly applicable in this context. Auxetic metamaterials, a new class of cellular materials with a negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR), expand under tensile load and densify under compressive load. This unique behavior improves performance and crashworthiness compared to conventional materials. This study examines the crushing performance and crashworthiness of the reentrant diamond auxetic (RDA) metamaterial, a previously unstudied type. Using the design of experiments (DOE), the study explores how structural parameters influence dynamic crushing and crashworthiness. Response surface-based surrogate models and multi-objective optimization are used to balance injury-based and energy-based crashworthiness metrics, which often conflict.

Furthermore, a theoretical model was established between braiding parameters, geometric parameters of honeycomb cell structure, and in-plane compressive modulus.

To further enhance the shape recovery properties and load-carrying capacity of kirigami-inspired honeycomb, the hierarchical structure is introduced by importing porous structures into cell walls of 4D-printed kirigami-inspired honeycomb (Structure II), and then an innovative honeycomb structure (Structure I) is designed for achieving the hierarchical effect. Additionally, three hierarchical structures with different shape configurations (Structure III–V) are also designed for comparing with traditional Structure II. The finite element analysis and experiments are conducted to compare the compression deformation behavior and energy absorption capacity of Structure I–V. It is found that Structure I exhibits significantly improved properties compared with the traditional Structure II. The stiffness of Structure I is increased by 50.43%, and the energy absorption performance is also increased by 65.00%. The recovery time has been shortened by 27.27% and it has a better shape recovery rate. Structure III–V can also enhance the performances compared with traditional Structure II.

However, most prior research has neglected the effect of V-shaped boundary condition on deformation modes and energy absorption mechanisms of sandwich tubes. In this study, lateral blast experiments and numerical simulations were conducted on aluminum foam sandwich circular tubes with four V-shaped constraints to analyze dynamic response and energy absorption mechanisms. A finite element model of a foam core developed using the 3D Voronoi algorithm simulated the deformation behavior of the sandwich circular tube. Three distinct deformation modes were identified in the experiments: localized large plastic deformation, integral bending around the plastic hinge, and overall slip of the structure. The deformation modes and mid-point deflections of both internal and external tubes obtained from numerical simulations showed strong agreement with the experimental results. The impact of the V-shaped constraints angle on the blast resistance of the sandwich tubes were investigated, revealing that while the angle significantly influenced the deformation modes, it had minimal effect on the energy absorption capacity of the structures. Multi-objective optimization of the sandwich tubes was conducted using a combination of the response surface method (RSM) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA).

The ballistic performances of the CCSS with metal face plates hit vertically by projectiles with the nose shapes of conical, flat, and hemispherical are studied analytically and numerically in this paper. Based on the principle of energy conservation, an analytical model of ballistic characteristics of the sandwich ceramic core structure is developed. Numerical calculations are conducted, and the numerical model has been verified by experimental results from references by others. In addition, the analytical results agree well with finite element results. The effects of shape of projectile head, the thickness ratio of three plates of CCSS, and the ratio of shear strength of ceramic core to yield strength of metal face plates on the ballistic characteristics of the CCSS are discussed. It is shown that the conical-nosed projectile achieved the highest ballistic limit velocity (BLV) and the sharper nose increases the normal stress at the impact area thereby enhancing the BLV. The thickness of the ceramic core significantly influences the resistance of the CCSS and the thicker ceramic core enhances the ability of CCSS to absorb kinetic energy from the projectile. Furthermore, an appropriate increase in the yield strength of face plates can enhance the anti-ballistic impact performance of the CCSS. These insights have practical implications for the design of protective systems in military and civilian applications, where optimizing materials for impact resistance is crucial. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","analytical model; Ballistic limit; ceramic core; energy absorption; sandwich structure","Honeycomb structures; Shape optimization; Shear strength; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Yield stress; Ballistic characteristics; Ballistic impact; Ballistic Limit; Ballistic limit velocity; Ceramic core; Energy; Face plates; High-energy absorption; Impact performance; Lightweight materials; Sandwich structures","Palomba, Giulia, Lightweight sandwich structures for marine applications: a review, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 26, pp. 4839-4864, (2022); Wang, Mingshi, Plastic behavior of metal sandwich beams with foam-filled sinusoidal corrugation, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 7, pp. 1620-1632, (2024); Shafiei, Ehsan, Simulation and experimental validation of shear deformation and strength of textile-reinforced composites, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 25, pp. 4569-4581, (2022); Zhang, Jianxun, Large deflection of foam-filled Y-shape sandwich beams under lateral loading, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 14, pp. 3020-3032, (2024); Kilic, Namik, Optimization of high hardness perforated steel armor plates using finite element and response surface methods, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 24, 7, pp. 615-624, (2017); Zhang, Fubin, Mechanical properties of the composite sandwich structures with cold formed profiled steel plate and balsa wood core, Engineering Structures, 300, (2024); Yang, Lihong, Ballistic performance of composite armor with dual layer piecewise ceramic tiles under sequential impact of two projectiles, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 1, pp. 1-14, (2022); Sayyad, Atteshamuddin Shamshuddin, Modeling and analysis of functionally graded sandwich beams: a review, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 26, 21, pp. 1776-1795, (2019); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of multilayer curved aluminum honeycomb sandwich beams under low-velocity impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 177, (2022); Yang, Lihong, Dynamic response of graded PVC foam sandwich panel under air blast loads, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 25, pp. 3694-3708, (2022)",""

However, existing research predominantly centers on chiral honeycomb structures, neglecting discussions on the energy absorption capabilities of anti-chiral honeycomb structures subjected to out-of-plane impacts. In view of this, an innovative design method is proposed in this paper to construct a series of anti-tri-chiral honeycomb structures (MATCH-θ) with missing rib-plate and excellent crashworthiness by skillfully designing and replacing the nodal elements of the anti-tri-chiral structures. Subsequently, the effects of the constitutive angle θ and the wall thickness t of the cellular elements were investigated using a validated finite element model, revealing the energy absorption mechanism of MATCH-θ. It is shown that this type of structure has better crashworthiness performance compared to the conventional anti-tri-chiral honeycomb structure ATCH-90°. In particular, the MATCH-110° structure with t = 0.1 mm showed a 36% increase in specific energy absorption, a 36% increase in mean crush force, and a 35% increase in crush force efficiency compared to the conventional anti-tri-chiral honeycomb structure ATCH-90° with the same mass.

Origami-based core offers a large enhancement of the mechanical properties, yet little study research focuses on the effect of various foldcore configurations on the transverse mechanical properties of sandwich tubes, necessitating the design method for applications. This study introduces an innovative approach by incorporating origami into the composite sandwich core to enhance the transverse energy absorption capacity. The quasi-static transverse mechanical properties of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich tubes with foldcores are studied under three-point bending-like local compression and transverse structural compression. A systematic geometric design framework and numerical modelling technique are provided. By integrating finite element analysis and experiments, the research investigates the effects of various origami foldcore configurations and geometric parameters on transverse energy absorption capacity. The experiment setup is provided by sandwich tubular specimens with a full-diamond configuration as the foldcore. The cylindrical tubes (foldcore) of the sandwich structures were manufactured using four plies [0°]<inf>4</inf> of T700 (T300) woven CFRP with the hot press moulding (vacuum bag using female and male moulds) technique respectively. Then, the parametric study and damage mode analysis of eight different foldcore patterns (axial Miura, circumferential Miura, diamond, Kresling, and their curved-creased counterparts) were studied. The results showed the superior energy absorption performance of the sandwich tube with Miura-pattern foldcore over the origami-pattern counterparts, nested tube, and traditional honeycomb sandwich tube with CFRP or aluminium-made cores. Therefore, the structural parameters optimisation of the Miura pattern tube was carried out by the Response Surface method (RSM) and a design strategy for increasing the energy absorption capacity was found. The findings offer guidance for designing high-specific energy absorption tubular structures for future advanced engineering applications. © The Author(s) 2024.","CFRP foldcore sandwich tube; design strategy; energy absorption performance; structural parameters optimization; transverse mechanical properties","Aerospace industry; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Hydroelasticity; Molding; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Absorption performance; Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer foldcore sandwich tube; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Design strategies; Energy; Energy absorption performance; Parameter optimization; Structural parameter; Structural parameter optimization; Transverse mechanical properties; Sandwich structures","Xiang, Xinmei, Energy absorption of origami inspired structures and materials, Thin-Walled Structures, 157, (2020); Nojima, Taketoshi, Development of newly designed ultra-light core structures, JSME International Journal, Series A: Solid Mechanics and Material Engineering, 49, 1, pp. 38-42, (2006); Peraza Hernandez, Edwin Alexander, Modeling and analysis of origami structures with smooth folds, CAD Computer Aided Design, 78, pp. 93-106, (2016); Ji, Jinchen, Vibration control based metamaterials and origami structures: A state-of-the-art review, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 161, (2021); Fang, Hongbin Bin, Advances in the dynamics of origami structures and origami metamaterials, Lixue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 54, 1, pp. 1-38, (2022); Supian, A.

The combination of green and recyclable short basalt-fiber-reinforced composite with advanced additive manufacturing technology makes it possible to design and fabricate the 3D printed hierarchical triangular honeycomb composites with exceptional mechanical properties for energy absorption applications. Out-of-plane quasi-static compression tests were performed on the 3D printed hierarchical honeycomb composite to investigate the compressive response and deformation behaviour of hierarchical triangular honeycombs. Parametric studies were conducted using ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code to study the effects of structural hierarchy and triangular cell size on mechanical properties and energy absorption of 3D printed hierarchical triangular honeycombs. The result revealed that the 3D printed hierarchical triangular honeycomb composite experienced a large and stable plastic deformation to densification without fracture failure resulting in excellent energy absorption. The second level triangular honeycomb composite exhibited the most promising mechanical properties. After optimization of the triangular cell size, the mean crushing force and specific energy absorption of the second level triangular honeycomb composite were about 1.7 times and 2.0 times those of the conventional hexagonal honeycomb composite. Compared to other typical hierarchical honeycombs, the proposed hierarchical triangular honeycomb composite exhibited higher plateau stress and larger densification strain, thus providing some insights in designing lightweight, recyclable and sustainable 3D printed honeycomb composites with superior mechanical properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy absorption; Fiber-reinforced composites; Finite element analysis; Hierarchical strategy; Honeycomb","ABAQUS; Compression testing; Densification; Honeycomb structures; Basalt fiber; Energy; Fibre-reinforced composite; Finite element analyse; Hierarchical strategies; Honeycomb; Honeycomb composite; Mechanical; Out-of-plane; Property; Fiber reinforced plastics","Jefferson Andrew, Jefferson, Energy absorption and self-sensing performance of 3D printed CF/PEEK cellular composites, Materials and Design, 208, (2021); Habib, Fatah N., In-plane energy absorption evaluation of 3D printed polymeric honeycombs, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 12, 2, pp. 117-131, (2017); Zeng, Chengjun, Compression behavior and energy absorption of 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composite honeycomb structures with shape memory effects, Additive Manufacturing, 38, (2021); Wang, Zhonggang, Out-of-plane crushing behavior of hybrid hierarchical square honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 181, (2022); Bates, Simon R.G., Compressive behaviour of 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane honeycombs with graded densities, Materials and Design, 162, pp. 130-142, (2019); Sang, Lin, Development of 3D-printed basalt fiber reinforced thermoplastic honeycombs with enhanced compressive mechanical properties, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 125, (2019); Khan, Muhammad Kashif, Experimental investigation of in-plane and out-of-plane crushing of aluminum honeycomb, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 539, pp. 135-142, (2012); Wang, Yuanlong, On the out-of-plane ballistic performances of hexagonal, reentrant, square, triangular and circular honeycomb panels, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 173, (2020); Journal of Machine Design, (2016); Xu, Shanqing, Experimental study of the out-of-plane dynamic compression of hexagonal honeycombs, Composite Structures, 94, 8, pp. 2326-2336, (2012)",""

After analyzing and comparing the crashworthiness of three typical honeycomb structures, the concave hexagonal negative Poisson’s ratio honeycomb is selected as the energy-absorbing inner core of the hydrogen storage tank protection structure. The sensitivity analysis of the structural parameters of the NPR shell is conducted through orthogonal tests to identify parameters with a significant impact on crash performance. These parameters are then used as experimental variables for subsequent optimization design. Subsequently, a response surface approximation model between the optimization objective and the structural parameters is established based on the response surface method. Finally, the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm (ASA), neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm (NCGA), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) are used to optimize the structural parameters, and the optimization results are verified by the whole-vehicle crash simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that all three algorithms achieve better optimization results, among which NCGA is more advantageous in improving the overall performance of the protective shell. After NCGA optimization, the specific energy absorption of the protective shell increases by 19.75%, the maximum collision force of the rigid wall decreases by 23.63%, and the maximum stress of the hydrogen storage tank body decreases by 22.77%.

The mechanical properties of rationally designed auxetic metamaterials are mostly influenced by their topological characteristics rather than the material properties of their constituent material. The goal of this paper is to use optimization algorithms to achieve the desired target mechanical properties for reentrant auxetic metamaterials. The GEKKO optimization package in Python is used for optimizing the geometry of auxetic lattice structures. Several mechanical properties including Poisson’s ratio, relative Young’s modulus, relative yield stress, and relative energy absorption capability, as well as the noted properties normalized with respect to relative density and relative Young’s modulus are chosen for being minimized or maximized. ANSYS finite element package is also implemented for validation of the results obtained from the optimization algorithm. According to the results, to achieve the maximum magnitude of Poisson’s ratio (positive and negative), the size of the unit cell in the lateral direction must be selected to be maximum and the thickness must become minimum. Moreover, to achieve the maximum value of the relative Young’s modulus or energy absorption in any direction, the size of the unit cell in that direction must be maximized. Also, to achieve the maximum amount of relative yield stress in both directions, the unit cell must have a maximum thickness and an internal angle close to zero. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2D re-entrant; Auxetics; Honeycomb; Mechanical properties; Optimization; Poisson’s ratio","Biomechanics; Density (specific gravity); Energy absorption; Metamaterials; Optimization; Python; 2d re-entrant; Auxetics; Elastic mechanical properties; Honeycomb; Lattice structures; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Poisson’s ratio; S ratio; Unit cells; Yield stress","Abedini, Bahareh, Thermomechanical behavior of lattice structures: An analytical, numerical, and experimental study, Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines, 52, 7, pp. 3700-3723, (2024); Rahmani-Asl, Mohammad, BPOpt: A framework for BIM-based performance optimization, Energy and Buildings, 108, pp. 401-412, (2015); Atilla Yolcu, Dilek, Measurement of Poisson's ratio of the auxetic structure, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 204, (2022); Babaee, Sahab, 3D soft metamaterials with negative poisson's ratio, Advanced Materials, 25, 36, pp. 5044-5049, (2013); Beal, Logan D.R., GEKKO optimization suite, Processes, 6, 8, (2018); Topology Optimization Theory Methods and Applications, (2003); Berinskii, I.

Honeycombs with varying cell sizes, node lengths, and cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated and tested to observe their interaction with quasi-static, impact, and blast loads. The deformation mode under in-plane and out-of-plane quasi-static loads provided an idea about the structural soundness and adaptability of reinforced honeycombs under static conditions. Low-velocity impacts were performed to investigate the energy absorption and impact resistance of reinforced honeycomb structures, which are very suitable for aerospace and transportation sectors where impact mitigation is highly required. Comparisons between conventional honeycomb cores and the reinforced counterparts were made, with a focus on parameters such as weight, stiffness, and strength to help engineers in the optimization of designs for particular applications. Crashworthiness studies showed how cell size, node length, and cell-wall thickness influence energy absorption in impacts and provided a basis for the fulfillment of strict crash-resistance standards. Further understanding of the behaviour of these structures in dynamic scenarios was advanced by FEM simulations of blast loads, thus enabling the development of blast-resistant designs. The aluminium-reinforced honeycombs possessed an ultimate strength of 145.28 MPa, a yield strength of 98.15 MPa, and a modulus of elasticity of 69 GPa. Under low-velocity impact, the peak force of a reinforced honeycomb with cell size 10 mm and wall thickness 0.1 mm was 1456.8 N, which agreed very well with numerical prediction with an error of less than 5%. Blast tests showed that reinforced honeycomb cores reduced back-face sheet deformation by up to 37% compared to conventional honeycombs for a variety of explosive masses, with improved blast resistance and energy absorption. The results add much value to the design and optimization of honeycomb structures for various engineering applications and also form a basis for future research on wider manufacturing parameters, dynamic loading conditions, and environmental effects. © 2025 Techno-Press, Ltd.","aluminium-reinforced honeycomb; energy absorption; FEM; impact resistance; mechanical behaviour","Accidents; Blast resistance; Cells; Crashworthiness; Cytology; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Environmental impact; Explosives; Reinforcement; Structural design; Structural optimization; Aluminum-reinforced honeycomb; Blast loads; Cell-size; Cell-wall thickness; Energy; Experimental investigations; Honeycomb core; Low velocity impact; Mechanical behavior; Quasi-static loads; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Abbadi, Ahmed, Experimental study on the fatigue behaviour of honeycomb sandwich panels with artificial defects, Composite Structures, 120, pp. 394-405, (2015); Akatay, Abdullah, The influence of low velocity repeated impacts on residual compressive properties of honeycomb sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 125, pp. 425-433, (2015); An, Xuanyi, Penetration resistance of hybrid metallic honeycomb structures with ceramic insertions against long-rod tungsten projectiles, Composite Structures, 189, pp. 488-497, (2018); Bianchi, Gabriel, Static and fatigue behaviour of hexagonal honeycomb cores under in-plane shear loads, Applied Composite Materials, 19, 2, pp. 97-115, (2012); Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Cheng, Ping, Effects of cellular crossing paths on mechanical properties of 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced biocomposite honeycomb structures, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 178, (2024); Combescure, Christelle Jeanne, Post-bifurcation and stability of a finitely strained hexagonal honeycomb subjected to equi-biaxial in-plane loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 88-89, pp. 296-318, (2016); Crupi, Vincenzo, Collapse modes in aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 6-15, (2012); Crupi, Vincenzo, Comparison of aluminium sandwiches for lightweight ship structures: Honeycomb vs. foam, Marine Structures, 30, pp. 74-96, (2013); Fan, Zhiqiang, Blast resistance of metallic sandwich panels subjected to proximity underwater explosion, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 93, pp. 128-135, (2016)",""

Compared to conventional honeycomb or foam materials, auxetic configurations can reduce peak stress by 20%–40%, extend the stress plateau by up to 60%, and enhance densification resistance by over 30%, making them highly suitable for impact, blast, and crash energy mitigation. This review systematically summarizes recent developments in the design, optimization, and manufacturing of auxetic structures for energy absorption purpose. Among various unit-cell topologies, modified re-entrant offer high specific energy absorption under quasi-static loading, while rotating and hierarchical designs demonstrate superior performance in multi-directional and dynamic scenarios. Optimization strategies, ranging from topology optimization to surrogate-assisted machine learning, enable precise tailoring of energy absorption profiles. Additionally, advances in additive manufacturing and modular assembly facilitate the scalable fabrication of complex auxetic geometries. This review highlights the correlations between structural features and energy absorption efficiency and proposes guidelines for selecting geometry, material, and fabrication strategies based on application-specific requirements. By integrating quantitative comparisons and performance-driven insights, this work aims to support the development and deployment of next-generation auxetic energy absorbers in engineering practice. © The Author(s) 2025","auxetic structures; design; energy absorption; manufacturing; negative Poisson’s ratio; optimization","Energy efficiency; Honeycomb structures; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Topology; Toughness; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Deformation behavior; Design applications; Design optimization; Energy; Mechanical; Negative poisson’s ratio; Optimisations; S ratio; Energy absorption","Acharya, Antu, Design and study of novel Nested auxetic lattices with tunable and enhanced in-plane elastic properties, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 293, (2024); Agrawal, Gourav, Robust topology optimization of negative Poisson's ratio metamaterials under material uncertainty, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 198, (2022); Airoldi, Alessandro, Foam-filled energy absorbers with auxetic behaviour for localized impacts, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 788, (2020); Aktaş, Cüneyt, An investigation of the crashworthiness performance and optimization of tetra-chiral and reentrant crash boxes, Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines, 51, 12, pp. 6881-6904, (2023); Albak, Emre İsa, Crashworthiness design for multi-cell circumferentially corrugated thin-walled tubes with sub-sections under multiple loading conditions, Thin-Walled Structures, 164, (2021); Albak, Emre İsa, Optimization for multi-cell thin-walled tubes under quasi-static three-point bending, Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 44, 5, (2022); Aldhafferi, Nahier, Extreme learning machine computational method of modeling energy gap of doped zinc selenide nano-material semiconductor, Materials Today Communications, 31, (2022); Alomarah, Amer, A bio-inspired auxetic metamaterial with two plateau regimes: Compressive properties and energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 192, (2023); Ashfaq, Babar, A novel design of mono and bi-cells based hybrid auxetic structures and assessment of their compressive properties, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 28, pp. 1620-1632, (2024); Bai, Yisong, Programmable Mechanical Metamaterials with Tailorable Negative Poisson's Ratio and Arbitrary Thermal Expansion in Multiple Thermal Deformation Modes, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 14, 31, pp. 35905-35916, (2022)",""

A key factor in ensuring the stability of the entire support system is the ability of the yielding structure to provide stable and sustained constant-resistance yielding. This study investigates the yielding mechanical properties of steel honeycomb structures and examines the influence of their parameters on performance, using both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Additionally, the yielding behavior of different honeycomb configurations is compared to identify the optimal structure for steel honeycomb elements. First, laboratory experiments are conducted to assess the effects of honeycomb wall thickness, unit height, and layer count on yielding performance. Next, numerical simulations are used to analyze the yielding behavior of various honeycomb configurations, facilitating the selection of the most suitable structure for yielding support. The results show that steel honeycombs under compression exhibit elastic, constant-resistance, strengthening, and densification stages. The constant-resistance and strengthening stages govern energy absorption efficiency, determined by three metrics: constant-resistance load, effective yielding displacement, and energy absorption capacity. Thicker walls increase load capacity and energy absorption but reduce deformation. Larger cell heights lower load resistance but enhance deformation and energy absorption. More layers at the same cell height improve deformation without sacrificing strain efficiency. High-load applications require thicker walls and shorter cells. Circular, concave, and hexagonal honeycombs offer optimal stability, with low peak loads, near-unity peak-to-mean ratios, and smooth load–displacement transitions. Triangular and quadrilateral designs, despite high energy absorption, exhibit unstable yielding due to excessive peak loads and rapid unloading. The former group is recommended for engineering applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Constant-resistance yielding; Energy absorption; Honeycomb configurations; Steel honeycomb element; Yielding support","Energy efficiency; Numerical models; Structural optimization; Unloading; Constant-resistance yielding; Energy; Honeycomb configuration; Honeycomb elements; Laboratory experiments; Performance; Steel honeycomb element; Thick-wall; Yielding behavior; Yielding supports; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","International Journal of Geoengineering Case Histories, (2010); Barla, Giovanni B., Analysis of the behaviour of a yield-control support system in squeezing rock, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 26, 1, pp. 146-154, (2011); Miliziano S Soil Structure Interaction of Preliminary Deformable Lining for Conventional Tunnel in Squeezing Conditions Using Hidste Elements; Cantieni, Linard, The interaction between yielding supports and squeezing ground, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 24, 3, pp. 309-322, (2009); Chen, Ziquan, A Case Study on the Asymmetric Deformation Characteristics and Mechanical Behavior of Deep-Buried Tunnel in Phyllite, Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, 52, 11, pp. 4527-4545, (2019); Chen, Ziquan, Supporting mechanism and mechanical behavior of a double primary support method for tunnels in broken phyllite under high geo-stress: a case study, Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment, 78, 7, pp. 5253-5267, (2019); Chen, Shuai, A novel gradient negative stiffness honeycomb for recoverable energy absorption, Composites Part B: Engineering, 215, (2021); Hazard Control in Tunnelling and Underground Engineering, (2022); Deng, Xiaolin, In-plane energy absorption characteristics and mechanical properties of novel re-entrant honeycombs, Composite Structures, 313, (2023); Entfellner, Manuel, Investigating High-Strength Expanded Polystyrene (HS-EPS) as yielding support elements for tunnelling in squeezing ground conditions, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 140, (2023)",""

To further improve the stiffness and energy absorption capacity of the structure, this paper proposes a modified re-entrant auxetic honeycomb structure by introducing a circular structure into a re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb cell and then connecting the two together using two reinforcing bars. The bending performance of their made sandwich beams (MRBs) is investigated by the finite element method. The results show that the MRB preserves the negative Poisson's ratio characteristics of the RB compared to the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb sandwich beam (RB). In addition, the maximum compressive force and specific energy absorption of the MRB, respectively, increase by 232.8 and 111.8%, which significantly improves its stiffness and energy absorption performance. Subsequently, the parameter analysis revealed that the stiffness, energy absorption, and auxetic effects of the MRB can be further optimized by properly adjusting the geometric parameters. Finally, the complex proportionality assessment method (COPRAS) is implemented to determine the influence weights of the structural parameters on the bending performance of the sandwich beams. The results show that the structural parameters of the core layer have a more significant effect on the bending performance, especially with the modified honeycomb cell thickness.

The primary findings demonstrate the advantages of hybrid structures that combine hexagonal honeycomb and reentrant cells. Mechanical strength assessments revealed that the hybrid specimen with a ratio of R3/H2 retained 89% of the flexural strength of the hexagonal configuration (1520 N) while exhibiting 82% of the elongation capacity of the reentrant structure (13.0 mm), indicating a balanced optimization of strength and flexibility. Energy absorption tests showed a significant increase in total fracture energy with the proportion of hexagonal cells, rising from approximately 15.41 J/m2 for fully reentrant (R5-H0) to 17.98 J/m2 for fully hexagonal (R0-H5), highlighting the superior energy dissipation capabilities of the hybrid structures. Impact resistance evaluations revealed that the hybrid configuration R1/H4 absorbed 16.43 J of impact energy, compared to 15.41 J for the fully reentrant structure, underscoring the benefits of integrating hexagonal cells for enhanced stiffness. The row-based hybridization approach allows for precise tuning of mechanical properties, enabling tailored structures to meet specific application demands. Future work will involve calculating the moments of inertia for each specimen to more accurately quantify their resistance to bending and provide deeper insights into the structural advantages of hybrid designs.

However, traditional honeycomb configurations often exhibit inadequate load-bearing capacity and limited energy absorption efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel ring-arc honeycomb (RAH) structure characterized by a double-plateau stress response. The mechanical behavior and energy absorption performance of the RAH are investigated through quasistatic compression experiments and validated using finite element simulations. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the influence of cell radius, cell angle, and wall thickness on structural performance. The results reveal that the RAH exhibits a distinct two-stage stress plateau under compression. Compared with the conventional re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb, the RAH structure shows a 140% increase in initial peak stress, a 282% enhancement in plateau stress, and a 191% improvement in specific energy absorption, demonstrating significantly improved load-bearing and energy dissipation capacity.

For the methodology, a set of simulation experiments is conducted using the uniform design (UD) method. Static and dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) is employed to calculate the maximum von Mises stress (VMS) and deformation in the honeycomb core (HCC) under ASTM tension, compression, and impact load testing rules using ANSYS/Workbench. Additionally, the energy absorption of the HCS model is evaluated from dynamic FEA results. By integrating Kriging interpolation (KGI), entropy weighting analysis (EWA), gray relation analysis (GRA), and genetic algorithm (GA), various optimal design results for the HCC model are obtained, considering maximum structural strength and energy absorption rate, respectively. After applying the multi-objective optimal design procedure, the improvement rate for the maximal von Mises stress is 40.5% comparing to the original design. Moreover, the improved rates for the maximum deformation and energy absorption are 16.2% and 21.5%.

In the current investigation, the structural performance of a honeycomb-structured cylindrical sample of Ti6Al4V alloy manufactured by direct metal laser sintering process was investigated under compressive loading in the quasistatic and dynamic regime. The microstructural characterization was performed using secondary electron imaging and electron backscatter diffraction in a scanning electron microscope. The as-printed sample was characterized by closed porosity, partially sintered particles, and surface microcracks as major defects. The quasistatic compression behavior of the sample was characterized by a fluctuating load-displacement curve due to the layer-by-layer progressive collapse of the structure from top to bottom. The microcracks on the walls of the structure propagate in the transverse direction upon load application, causing local instability in the structure. A similar behavior was also observed for dynamic deformed sample although the amount of collapse was limited. Detailed microstructural characterization indicates the absence of plastic deformation under quasistatic and dynamic regimes highlighting the role of surface microcracks in the final failure of the structure.

Unlike previous approaches that enhance auxetic behavior by adding new elements, this work adopts a functional grading strategy based on geometric variation to tailor mechanical properties. Three auxetic patterns—reentrant, reentrant combined-wall (RCW) honeycomb, and ellipse—were chosen for their design adaptability and suitability for functional grading. These patterns were redesigned using a geometric grading approach, fabricated via fused deposition modeling (FDM), and tested under compressive loading. The novelty of the study lies in the implementation of functional grading through geometry rather than material composition. The experimental results demonstrated that functionally graded models outperformed their uniform counterparts, particularly in the elastic–plastic region, with increases of 56% for the reentrant model, 35% for the RCW honeycomb, and 53% for the ellipse based on load carrying capacity. Moreover, the graded ellipse model achieved the highest energy absorption among the tested specimens. Functional grading also influenced deformation initiation, enabling more controlled structural behavior. These findings highlight the potential of geometric grading to enhance auxetic structures, offering promising insights for future design and optimization efforts. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Auxetic structures; compression test; functionally graded structures; mechanical performance","Geometry; Grading; Honeycomb structures; Structural design; Auxetic behavior; Auxetic structures; Compression test; Functional grading; Functionally graded structure; Geometric variations; Mechanical; Mechanical performance; Property; S ratio; Compression testing","Hao, Jian, Novel dual-platform lightweight metamaterials with auxeticity, Engineering Structures, 270, (2022); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic polymers: a new range of materials, Endeavour, 15, 4, pp. 170-174, (1991); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Nature, (1991); Han, Dong, Lightweight auxetic metamaterials: Design and characteristic study, Composite Structures, 293, (2022); Gatt, Ruben, Negative Poisson's ratios in tendons: An unexpected mechanical response, Acta Biomaterialia, 24, pp. 201-208, (2015); Pagliara, Stefano, Auxetic nuclei in embryonic stem cells exiting pluripotency, Nature Materials, 13, 6, pp. 638-644, (2014); Li, Xiang, Novel auxetic structures with enhanced mechanical properties, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 27, pp. 59-65, (2019); Liu, Yangzuo, Auxetic meta-materials and their engineering applications: a review, Engineering Research Express, 5, 4, (2023); Zhao, Changfang, Experimental study and finite element analysis on energy absorption of carbon fiber reinforced composite auxetic structures filled with aluminum foam, Composite Structures, 303, (2023)",""

Honeycomb sandwich panels have outstanding specific strengths with efficient energy-absorbing ability and are widely employed as protective panels against extreme air blast loadings. Improvement in the air blast mitigation performance of the honeycomb sandwich panels without increasing their mass and volume occupancy is the challenging task for weight-critical applications. Therefore, in the present explicit numerical study, the effect of honeycomb core topologies (square, reentrant, octagonal, and circular) on the blast performance of the high-strength AL-6XN sandwich panels is investigated at constant mass and volume for 1–3 TNT air blast loadings. The unit cell volume occupancy of the different honeycomb cores is also maintained constantly. The rate-dependent Johnson-Cook material model was used for achieving realistic plastic deformations in the designed sandwich panels. To identify an optimal honeycomb core design, the blast performance of the designed honeycomb sandwich panels of the equal mass is compared in terms of their face sheets center point deflections, face sheets radial deflections, changes in kinetic energy, changes in internal energy, plastic dissipation energy (PDE), deformation modes, and equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) of the core structures. The obtained results indicated that the circular honeycomb core used sandwich panels have better blast resistance than the other designed sandwich panels of the identical mass in terms of smaller back face sheet’s center point deflection and radial deflection and higher energy absorption by the core structure. Hence, the circular honeycomb core is the most suitable candidate for designing protective structures against blast attacks, such as skid plates of armor vehicle. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Air blast; crushing; energy absorption; honeycomb; sandwich panel; TNT","","Asaithambi, Prakash, Investigation of the effect of exposed area on blast mitigation response of structures, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 32, 7, pp. 1488-1503, (2025); Quanjin, Ma, Numerical modeling of composite spherical-roof contoured core (SRCC) sandwich panels subjected to blast loading, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 32, 11, pp. 2635-2657, (2025); Gerdooei, Mahdi, Improving the performance of a multi-layer armored system subjected to shock loading of an underwater explosion, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 3, pp. 419-428, (2022); Ahmed, Sameh, Response of Metallic Sandwich Panels to Blast Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 145, 12, (2019); Patel, Murlidhar, Assessment of dynamic response of armor grade steel plates and FMLs under air-blast loads, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 32, 11, pp. 2574-2595, (2025); Patel, Murlidhar, Dynamic behavior analysis of steel, aluminum, and composite plates under extreme air blast loadings, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 32, 23, pp. 5830-5846, (2025); Du, Jinlong, On dynamic response of double-layer rectangular sandwich plates with FML face-sheets and metal foam cores under blast loading, Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 45, 1, (2023); Wang, Tao, Blast response of geometrically asymmetric metal honeycomb sandwich plate: Experimental and theoretical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 105, pp. 24-38, (2017); Jin, Xiaochao, Dynamic response of sandwich structures with graded auxetic honeycomb cores under blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 106, pp. 206-217, (2016); Zhu, Feng, Structural response and energy absorption of sandwich panels with an aluminium foam core under blast loading, Advances in Structural Engineering, 11, 5, pp. 525-536, (2008)",""

Five geometric parameters—horizontal and inclined ligament lengths, cylinder radius, ligament angle, and wall thickness—are selected as design variables. A surrogate model coupled with a genetic algorithm is developed to simultaneously maximize energy absorption (EA) and minimize structural mass under low-velocity impact loading from a rigid sphere. Five ACRH configurations, including the optimised design, are systematically compared. Results indicate that the method effectively identifies optimal parameters, achieving a 16.95% increase in EA and a 23.74% mass reduction relative to the baseline.

The hybrid HCS, composed of re-entrant (RE) and elliptical annular re-entrant (EARE) honeycomb cells, was created by constructing arrangement matrices to achieve structural lightweight. The machine learning (ML) framework consisted of a neural network (NN) forward regression model for predicting impact resistance and a multi-objective optimization algorithm for generating high-performance designs. The surrogate of the local design space was initially realized by establishing the NN in the small sample dataset, and the active learning strategy was used to continuously extended the local optimal design until the model converged in the global space. The results indicated that the active learning strategy significantly improved the inference capability of the NN model in unknown design domains. By guiding the iteration direction of the optimization algorithm, lightweight designs with high impact resistance were identified. The energy absorption capacity of the optimal design reached 94.98% of the EARE honeycomb, while the initial peak stress and mass decreased by 28.85% and 19.91%, respectively. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for global explanation of the NN indicated a strong correlation between the arrangement mode of HCS and its impact resistance. By reducing the stiffness of the cells at the top boundary of the structure, the initial impact damage sustained by the structure can be significantly improved. Overall, this study proposed a general lightweight design method for array structures under impact loads, which is beneficial for the widespread application of honeycomb-based protective structures. © 2025 China Ordnance Society","Hybrid structures; Impact resistance; Inverse design; Lightweight; Re-entrant honeycomb","Inverse problems; Model structures; Structural analysis; Active learning strategies; Design frameworks; Ellipticals; High impact resistance; Hybrid structure; Inverse designs; Lightweight; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Re-entrant honeycomb; Honeycomb structures","Hu, Qianran, The personal protective equipment (PPE) based on individual combat: A systematic review and trend analysis, Defence Technology, 28, pp. 195-221, (2023); Xia, Ping, Achieving high strength and energy absorption of novel 3D printed helical layered square honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 203, (2024); Li, Jiachen, Experimental crushing behavior and energy absorption of angular gradient honeycomb structures under quasi-static and dynamic compression, Defence Technology, 36, pp. 47-63, (2024); Zhang, Yong, Load characteristics of triangular honeycomb structures with self-similar hierarchical features, Engineering Structures, 257, (2022); Qi, Chang, Dynamic crushing response of novel re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs: Numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, Aerospace Science and Technology, 124, (2022); Zhang, Jianjun, Energy absorption of re-entrant honeycombs in tension and compression, Engineering Structures, 288, (2023); Def Technol, (2024); Esmaeili, Afshin, A new design of star auxetic metastructure with enhanced energy-absorption under various loading rates: Experimental and numerical study, Structures, 63, (2024); Jiang, Hongyong, Crashworthiness of novel concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio biologically inspired by coconut palm, Thin-Walled Structures, 154, (2020); Hao, Jian, Novel dual-platform lightweight metamaterials with auxeticity, Engineering Structures, 270, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

The objective is to develop a lightweight yet robust alternative to conventional homogeneous armor materials such as Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA), Modified Homogeneous Armor (MHA), and High Nitrogen Steel (HNS). Post-processing treatments, including stress relieving and heat treatment, resulted in a 14.14-57.77% reduction in surface roughness and a 39.67-57.36% increase in hardness, enhancing mechanical integrity.

Numerical methods are employed to analyze the deformation modes and bending responses of sandwich beams with various core layers under three-point bending conditions. It is observed that the NCH-SW demonstrates distinct deformation modes and superior bending resistance and energy-absorbing properties compared to the re-entrant-star cellular sandwich beam (RSH-SW). Additionally, the buckling resistance of NCH-SW is influenced by the compression position and the geometric parameters of the sandwich beam. When compressed at C-position (circle ring), NCH-SW demonstrates exceptional load-carrying capacity and energy absorption. The energy absorption (EA) at the C-position is 73.7% higher, and the specific energy absorption (SEA) is 73.6% higher compared to the R-position (re-entrant cell). Increasing the thickness and distribution of the upper and lower panels positively impacts the bending resistance of the sandwich beam, particularly when the thickness of the lower panel is increased. In addition, altering the cell angle θ enhances the bending resistance of NCH-SW; however, if θ is too large, it diminishes the load-carrying capacity and energy absorption capability of the sandwich beam. Unlike θ, an increase in wall thickness (t) leads to a rise in maximum impact force (MIF), while crush force efficiency (CLE) decreases. There is a notable enhancement in EA, although SEA remains limited. Finally, the geometrical parameters (t, θ) of NCH are optimally designed to obtain NCH-SW with excellent bending resistance through response surface methodology, utilizing SEA and MIF as optimization indices.

Initially, numerical simulations were conducted to analyse the effect of wall thickness in upper and lower sections of the absorber, as well as the parameter 'n‘ that characterises the type of thickness variations within the wall, as design variables. A comprehensive database was compiled, encompassing various combinations of these parameters. Subsequently, a mathematical model was developed by fitting it to the initial data using the response surface methodology. The specific absorption energy and initial crush force were computed and utilised as the objective function for optimisation. Ultimately, by employing the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) technique and applying problem constraints, an optimal configuration for the honeycomb absorber was determined, with a focus on maximising the specific absorption energy.

They are intentionally designed to collapse in a controlled manner during frontal collisions. The objective of this research is to enhance the energy absorption capabilities of crash boxes through the integration of strut-based lattice patterns. Initially, crash boxes of various geometries suitable for lattice insertion were selected and optimized by analyzing their energy absorption capacity using ABAQUS software. The analysis revealed that the square crash box exhibited the highest energy absorption. Subsequently, the procedure entailed integrating various unit cell-based lattice patterns into square crash box. These constructed models were subjected to simulations to evaluate their specific energy absorption (SEA) performance, which is ratio of energy absorbed to its mass. The simulation outcomes conclusively determined the body-centered cubic (BCC) crash box as the most effective among the considered structures. During optimization, fine-Tuning the BCC crash box has been done by adjusting unit cell dimensions and strut diameter, which boosts energy absorption by 30.16% compared to the initial square crash box.

Finally, the multiscale optimization methods are extended to the design of 2D sandwich cantilever beams and 3D sandwich fully clamped beams. © 2024 by the authors.","energy absorption; micro-nano 3D printing; multiscale concurrent topology optimization; numerical simulation; three-point bending test","Bending tests; Honeycomb structures; Macros; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Energy; Micro-nano 3d printing; Micro/nano; Multi-scale optimization; Multiscale concurrent topology optimization; Optimization method; Three-point bending test; Topology optimisation; Sandwich structures","Markworth, Alan J., Modelling studies applied to functionally graded materials, Journal of Materials Science, 30, 9, pp. 2183-2193, (1995); Li, Shiqiang, Finite element simulation of metallic cylindrical sandwich shells with graded aluminum tubular cores subjected to internal blast loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 96-97, pp. 1-12, (2015); Mohammadi, Hossein, An insight from nature: Honeycomb pattern in advanced structural design for impact energy absorption, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 22, pp. 2862-2887, (2023); Yao, Ruyang, A bio-inspired foam-filled multi-cell structural configuration for energy absorption, Composites Part B: Engineering, 238, (2022); Yang, Jiankai, Optimization of bio-inspired bi-directionally corrugated panel impact-resistance structures: Numerical simulation and selective laser melting process, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 91, pp. 59-67, (2019); Yin, Sha, Strong and Tough Bioinspired Additive-Manufactured Dual-Phase Mechanical Metamaterial Composites, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 149, (2021); Jia, Zian, Engineering lattice metamaterials for extreme property, programmability, and multifunctionality, Journal of Applied Physics, 127, 15, (2020); Zhang, Tianhui, Dynamic response and energy absorption performance of aluminum foam-filled sandwich circular tubes under internal blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 173, (2023); Zhu, Feng, Some theoretical considerations on the dynamic response of sandwich structures under impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 6, pp. 625-637, (2010); Duda, Thomas, 3D Metal Printing Technology, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 29, pp. 103-110, (2016)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Glass-fibre/epoxy facesheets with various PVC foam core configurations underwent low-velocity single and multiple impacts. An in situ moisture-uptake methodology monitored moisture ingress until saturation. Results showed moisture uptake reduced impact bending capacity and bending stiffness to varying degrees. While energy-absorption performance remained largely unchanged under single impacts, significant differences were noted for multiple impacts. Failure analysis confirmed the reductions in some damage modes such as facesheet fracture, indentation, and core shear failures, while core shearing, delamination, core/facesheet debonding, and fibre breakage were identified as the main failure modes. These insights enhance understanding and optimisation of FRPSSs for improved out-of-plane damage resistance in marine applications. © 2024 by the authors.","acoustic emission; composite sandwich; impact bending; moisture uptake; X-ray micro-CT","Acoustic emission testing; Bending (forming); Failure modes; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Marine applications; Shearing; Acoustic-emissions; Bending behaviour; Composite sandwich structure; Composite sandwiches; Face sheets; Fibre-reinforced composite; Impact bending; Moisture uptake; Multiple impact; X-ray micro-CT; Sandwich structures","Iqbal, Zafar, Investigating damage resistance in aerospace radome applications: Experimental analysis of hybrid sandwich composites, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 44, 15-16, pp. 849-864, (2025); Wei, Shiyi, High-velocity impact resistance of the carbon fiber composite grid sandwich structures, Polymer Composites, 45, 6, pp. 5558-5573, (2024); Chang, Bianhong, Energy Absorption and Damage Analysis of Fragments in High-Speed Impact on Composite Honeycomb Sandwich Structures, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 16, (2024); Cestino, Enrico, Effectiveness of Nanotechnology Treatments in Composite Aircraft Applications, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 5, (2024); Osa-Uwagboe, Norman, Seawater Effect on Energy-Absorption Properties of Polymer-Based Composite Sandwich Structures, Procedia Structural Integrity, 54, pp. 44-51, (2024); Cao, Yan, Experimental and numerical studies on shear behavior of lattice-web reinforced PET foam sandwich panels, Engineering Structures, 290, (2023); Osa-Uwagboe, Norman, Review on Mechanical Performance of Fibre-Reinforced Plastics in Marine Environments, Applied Composite Materials, 31, 6, pp. 1991-2018, (2024); Wu, Qingqing, Study on the dynamic mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials based on asymmetrical sandwich beams, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 8, (2018); Chawla, Vivek, The combined effect of temperature and seawater on the compression properties of carbon fiber vinyl ester composites for sandwich structures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 26, 2, pp. 133-151, (2024); Khan, Mahfujul Haque, Impact performance and bending behavior of carbon-fiber foam-core sandwich composite structures in cold arctic temperature, Journal of Composites Science, 4, 3, (2020)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Various metastructures in the form of four auxetic geometries are proposed as the sandwich core: re-entrant honeycomb (REH), double-arrow honeycomb (DAH), star honeycomb (SH), and tetra-chiral honeycomb (CH). This paper employs a combination of finite element and machine learning methodologies to evaluate blastworthiness performance. Optimization is carried out using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method. The optimization results show significant improvements in blastworthiness performance, with notable reductions in permanent displacement and enhancements in specific energy absorption (SEA). Global sensitivity analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals that cell thickness is the most critical factor affecting blastworthiness performance, followed by the number of cells and corner angle or radius for CH. The application of optimized ASP on AFVs shows promising results, with no failure occurring in the occupant floor. Furthermore, AFVs equipped with the optimized ASP DAH significantly reduce maximum displacement and acceleration by 39.00% and 43.56%, respectively, and enhance SEA by 48.30% compared to optimized aluminum foam sandwich panels. This study concludes that ASPs have potential applications in broader engineering fields. © 2024 by the authors.","armored fighting vehicle; auxetic structure; blastworthiness; finite element; machine learning; protective structures; sandwich panels","Armored vehicles; Honeycomb structures; Linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Structural optimization; Armoured fighting vehicles; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Blastworthiness; Design objectives; Finite element; Machine-learning; Performance; Protective structures; Sandwich panel; Sensitivity analysis","Krzystała, Edyta, Minimisation of the explosion shock wave load onto the occupants inside the vehicle during trinitrotoluene charge blast, International Journal of Injury Control and Safety Promotion, 23, 2, pp. 170-178, (2016); Landmine Monitor, (2023); Nurick, Gerald N., Deformation of thin plates subjected to impulsive loading-A review.

However, the performance of the thin-walled tube system is greatly limited by the presence of redundant connection structures. To address these issues, a multi-bionic design strategy for high-performance modular system was developed in this work, which innovatively combines the robust joint structure of the interlocking suture with the efficient deformation mode of the Bouligand structures. In the design process, the suture-inspired system was studied separately, and its mechanical behaviors were investigated by FEM simulations and experiments. The results showed that the modular system has good structural scalability and tunable deformation mode, and can be adjusted on demand to accommodate different loads and geometric features. Furthermore, in order to reduce the weight and improve the deformation degree of the system, an optimization strategy inspired by the efficient deformation mode of the Bouligand structure was proposed by perforating a sequence of helix-arranged guide holes in the sidewalls of the tubes. The results showed that the double-helix perforated system can reduce the weight by 10% while increasing the specific energy absorption by 58% compared with the unperforated system. In addition, the specific energy absorption and energy absorption efficiency of the system are as high as 48.25 J/g and 56.17%, which is comparable to traditional honeycomb sandwich panels while retaining structural stability and adjustable performance. Therefore, this multi-bionic strategy can integrate the advantages of various natural structures and provide new insights for the design of high-performance protective systems. © 2024","Bionic strategies; Bouligand structure; Energy absorption; Interlocking suture; Modular system","Connectors (structural); Design of experiments; Honeycomb structures; Perforating; Religious buildings; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Structural optimization; Water towers; Bionic design; Bionic strategy; Bouligand structure; Deformation modes; Design strategies; Energy; Interlocking suture; Interlockings; Modular system; Performance; Thin walled structures","Alghamdi, Abdulmalik A.A., Collapsible impact energy absorbers: An overview, Thin-Walled Structures, 39, 2, pp. 189-213, (2001); Olabi, Abdul Ghani, Metallic tube type energy absorbers: A synopsis, Thin-Walled Structures, 45, 7-8, pp. 706-726, (2007); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Abramowicz, Wlodek, Thin-walled structures as impact energy absorbers, Thin-Walled Structures, 41, 2-3, pp. 91-107, (2003); Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Song, Jie, Light-weight thin-walled structures with patterned windows under axial crushing, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 66, pp. 239-248, (2013); Liu, Hu, Crashworthiness improvements of multi-cell thin-walled tubes through lattice structure enhancements, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 210, (2021); Ha, Ngoc-san, Thin-walled corrugated structures: A review of crashworthiness designs and energy absorption characteristics, Thin-Walled Structures, 157, (2020); Hu, Dayong, Energy-absorption characteristics of a bionic honeycomb tubular nested structure inspired by bamboo under axial crushing, Composites Part B: Engineering, 162, pp. 21-32, (2019); Zhang, Jianxun, On axial splitting and curling behaviour of circular sandwich metal tubes with metal foam core, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 202, pp. 111-125, (2020)",""

The study found that gyroid lattice structures exhibit high energy absorption capacity and good structural integrity under shock loading, making them suitable for high strength-to-weight ratio and energy absorption applications in aerospace and defense industries. The sandwich panel with a TPU-core structure exhibited the highest deformation under shock loading, with a maximum deflection of approximately 6 mm, followed by ABS at 0.9 mm and PLA at 0.82 mm. Under shock loading, the sandwich panel with TPU gyroid core exhibited the highest specific deformation energy (0.146 J/g), which is consistent with its flexibility, though it remained in the same general order as ABS (0.104 J/g) and PLA (0.070 J/g). Interestingly, the specific total energy of the TPU gyroid core sandwich, while the lowest at 39.310 J/g, was still relatively close to ABS (54.098 J/g) and PLA (52.620 J/g), despite the substantial difference in inherent stiffness of TPU compared to ABS and PLA. This suggests that while TPU's stiffness is much lower compared to PLA and ABS, its total energy absorption capability in gyroid form is not as drastically reduced, indicating the importance of geometry and mass distribution within the gyroid structure. Overall, the results of this study highlight the importance of careful design and optimization of these structures to utilize their unique properties fully. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Finite Element Analysis; Gyroid; Shock Response; Shock tube experiment","Crystal lattices; High speed photography; Honeycomb structures; Shock problems; Shock tubes; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Finite element analyse; Gyroids; Highspeed photography; Sandwich panel; Shock loadings; Shock response; Shock-tube experiments; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Total energy; Sandwich structures","Schaedler, Tobias A., Architected Cellular Materials, Annual Review of Materials Research, 46, pp. 187-210, (2016); Zhu, Feng, A review of blast and impact of metallic and sandwich structures, Electronic Journal of Structural Engineering, 7, pp. 92-101, (2007); Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids, MRS Bulletin, 28, 4, pp. 270-274, (2003); Hanssen, Arve Grønsund, Close-range blast loading of aluminium foam panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 27, 6, pp. 593-618, (2002); Light Weighting for Defense Aerospace and Transportation, (2019); Nguyen, Minh Q., Simulation of impact on sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 67, 2 SPEC.

Axial drop impact tests were employed to exert drop impact loading on cross-sections of the specimens with a square drop weight. The results showed that the X-direction filled tube (X-DFT) had a higher crushing strength and yield strength than that of the Y-direction filled tube (Y-DFT). As the tubular cross-section edge number of the filled tube increased, the specific energy absorption (SEA) and specific total efficiency (STE) decreased. Under the same axial drop impact loading conditions, the SEA and STE of the X-DFT were superior to those of the Y-DFT. As the edge number of the tubular cross-section or the tubular length ratio increased, the SEA and STE of the filled honeycomb tube decreased significantly. While the impact energy increased, the SEA and STE of the filled tubes increased approximately linearly. This work investigated the influence of drop-impact and structural parameters on deformation characteristics and energy absorption.

The finite element model of BZH under axial compression is established, and its accuracy is verified by experiments. Compared with a honeycomb of uniform beam thickness (DUH) of the same mass, the thickness of the beam becomes thicker in the middle and thinner on both sides, which causes the BZH to produce more plastic hinges when compressed, and the energy absorption is increased by 12 %. By parameter analysis of beam thickness distribution trend, the mechanical properties of BZH can be effectively controlled. A theoretical model of BZH under quasi-static compression is also established and the BZH configuration is optimized by proxy modeling technique and NSGA-II algorithm.

The micro-topology of core layers would sufficiently influence the property of sandwich structure. However, the micro deformation and topology mechanism of structural deformation and energy absorption are unclear. In this paper, based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method and periodic base cell (PBC) technology, a topology optimization frame work is proposed to optimize the core layer of sandwich beams. The objective of the present optimization problem is to maximize shear stiffness of PBC with a volume constraint. The effects of the volume fraction, filter radius, and initial PBC aspect ratio on the micro-topology of the core were discussed. The dynamic response process, core compression, and energy absorption capacity of the sandwich beams under blast impact loading were analyzed by the finite element method. The results demonstrated that the over-pressure action stage was coupled with the core compression stage. Under the same loading and mass per unit area, the sandwich beam with a 20% volume fraction core layer had the best blast resistance. The filter radius has a slight effect on the shear stiffness and blast resistances of the sandwich beams. But increasing the filter radius could slightly improve the bending stiffness. Upon changing the initial PBC aspect ratio, there are three ways for PBC evolution: The first is to change the angle between the adjacent bars, the second is to further form holes in the bars, and the third is to combine the first two ways. However, not all three ways can improve the energy absorption capacity of the structure. Changing the aspect ratio of the PBC arbitrarily may lead to worse results. More studies are necessary for further detailed optimization. This research proposes a new topology sandwich beam structure by micro-topology optimization, which has sufficient shear stiffness. The micro mechanism of structural energy absorption is clarified, it is significant for structural energy absorption design. © The Author(s) 2024.","Dynamic resistance; Energy absorption; Impact loading; Micro mechanism; Sandwich beam; Topology optimization","Beams and girders; Dynamic response; Honeycomb structures; Pressure vessels; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Structural optimization; Topology; Base cell; Core layers; Dynamic resistance; Energy; Impact loadings; Micromechanisms; Microtopology; Sandwich beams; Structural energies; Topology optimisation; Aspect ratio","Liu, Hua, Clamped sandwich beams with thick weak cores from central impact: A theoretical study, Composite Structures, 169, pp. 21-28, (2017); Hou, Weihong, Ballistic impact experiments of metallic sandwich panels with aluminium foam core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 10, pp. 1045-1055, (2010); Rizov, Victor Iliev, Indentation study of foam core sandwich composite panels, Composite Structures, 69, 1, pp. 95-102, (2005); Zhu, Feng, Some theoretical considerations on the dynamic response of sandwich structures under impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 6, pp. 625-637, (2010); Zhu, Feng, A numerical simulation of the blast impact of square metallic sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 5, pp. 687-699, (2009); Wang, Zhonggang, Recent advances in novel metallic honeycomb structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 166, pp. 731-741, (2019); Wang, Zhonggang, Crashworthiness index of honeycomb sandwich structures under low-speed oblique impact, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 208, (2021); Shu, Chengfu, Crashworthiness analysis of two-layered corrugated sandwich panels under crushing loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 133, pp. 42-51, (2018); Chang, Wanshu, Bending behavior of corrugated-core sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 70, 1, pp. 81-89, (2005); Wicks, Nathan, Performance of sandwich plates with truss cores, Mechanics of Materials, 36, 8, pp. 739-751, (2004)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

This design involves inserting cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells into a honeycomb cell core, eliminating the need for traditional modules. To reduce the weight of BP, collision analyses using the finite element method (FEM) are conducted with various thickness-to-length ratios for the honeycomb cell structures. A new mathematical formula is developed to calculate the energy absorption rate per unit volume and compared with the FEM results. Based on the formula, the optimal thickness-to-length ratio is determined. Furthermore, a new method to capture effective mechanical properties for the integrated battery cells with honeycomb cells is developed using the optimal thickness ratios and a modified rule of mixture. To enhance the collision safety of the honeycomb BP, its dimensions have been optimized by performing transient FE analyses while colliding with a rigid pillar on its one edge.

A hybrid bio-inspired design is suggested for the sandwich structures to absorb the energy of the blast loads in the current study. The sandwich structure's core, which often has a regular grid pattern resembling a honeycomb structure, is crucial to how well the panel absorbs energy. In order to achieve the best results, we first chose the structure of the core grid by taking into account potential 2D grids (polygons and multi-pointed stars) through Genetic Algorithm optimization. Next, we combined a bio-inspired bi-tubular thin-walled structure with the core grid to take advantage of its high energy absorption capacity. Finally, the performance of the suggested design is compared with four frequently implemented ones. The results show that the hybrid design has better energy absorption characteristics compared with the bionic and conventional designs presented in the literature. © The Author(s) 2024.","","article; controlled study; drug development; energy absorption; genetic algorithm; hybrid; laparoscopic morcellator; respiratory gas humidifier","Sun, Guangyong, Energy absorption mechanics for variable thickness thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 118, pp. 214-228, (2017); Pang, Tong, Energy absorption mechanism of axially-varying thickness (AVT) multicell thin-walled structures under out-of-plane loading, Engineering Structures, 196, (2019); Xu, Fengxiang, A review on functionally graded structures and materials for energy absorption, Engineering Structures, 171, pp. 309-325, (2018); Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Zhao, Ying, Mechanical properties and energy absorption capabilities of aluminium foam sandwich structure subjected to low-velocity impact, Construction and Building Materials, 273, (2021); Liu, Taiqu, Energy absorption characteristics of sandwich structures with composite sheets and bio coconut core, Composites Part B: Engineering, 114, pp. 328-338, (2017); Yazdani Sarvestani, Hamidreza, 3D printed meta-sandwich structures: Failure mechanism, energy absorption and multi-hit capability, Materials and Design, 160, pp. 179-193, (2018); Lian, Jinming, Study on re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs in-plane impact, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Dadoura, Mohamed H., Enhancement of quasi-static compression strength for aluminum closed cell foam blocks shielded by aluminum tubes, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Tang, Yufan, Hybrid acoustic metamaterial as super absorber for broadband low-frequency sound, Scientific Reports, 7, (2017)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

This paper introduces a novel modularized graded honeycomb into a commercial crash box to improve its crashworthiness. Design/methodology/approach: A modularized graded honeycomb is inserted into a commercial crash box to develop a novel crash box. Finite element analyses are conducted to investigate the crashworthiness. Pareto cumulative influence analysis is conducted to rank the effects of design parameters on crashworthiness. A surrogate model-based multi-objective optimization is carried out to improve energy absorption while limiting the impact peak force. An optimal Pareto solution set is obtained. Findings: Modularized honeycomb-filled crash box outperforms that of its corresponding uniform honeycomb-filled crash box and empty crash box in resisting impact. Pareto cumulative influence analysis reveals that for most crashworthiness indicators, cell-wall thicknesses of crash box tube contribute the most, followed by average relative density and graded coefficient of modularized honeycomb (MH). Graded coefficient contributes nearly 10% on mean force and maximum displacement, but it has insignificant influence on peak force and weight. Optimization results show that the optimal designs can not only absorb more energy but also limit the peak force compared with those of uniform honeycomb-filled crash box. Originality/value: This paper fills a MH into a commercial crash box to propose a novel crash box and demonstrates the positive impact of modularized design on crashworthiness compared with that of uniform honeycomb-filled crash box. Moreover, modularizing honeycomb does not change the weight of the filler, and thus, the novel crash box would benefit development of crash box with lightweight and excellent energy absorption capacity. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crashworthiness; Honeycomb-filled crash box; Modularized graded honeycomb; Optimization","Accidents; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Structural design; Crash box; Cumulative influence; Energy; Honeycomb-filled crash box; Influence analysis; Low-velocity; Modularized; Modularized graded honeycomb; Optimisations; Peak force; Crashworthiness","Aghamirzaie, Mojtaba, Optimization of the octagonal origami tube energy absorption using the artificial neural network and heuristic method, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering, 239, 5, pp. 2805-2817, (2025); Barzigar, Seyed Sajad, An analytical investigation on the crushing behavior of thin-walled tubes filled with a foam with strain hardening region, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Baykasoglu, C., Multi-objective crashworthiness optimization of square aluminum tubes with functionally graded BCC lattice structure filler, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 29, 1, pp. 80-94, (2024); Chen, Xie, Zero-Poisson's-Ratio Honeycomb-Filled Braided Textile Reinforced Conical Tubes: Designing, Manufacturing and Testing, Applied Composite Materials, 30, 3, pp. 773-789, (2023); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Optimization of foam-filled crash-box under axial loading for pure electric vehicle, Results in Materials, 21, (2024); Gao, Qiang, Crashworthiness optimization of cylindrical negative Poisson’s ratio structures with inner liner tubes, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 64, 6, pp. 4271-4286, (2021); Hou, Wenbinw Bin, Crashworthiness optimization of crash box with 3D-printed lattice structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 247, (2023); Hu, Lingling, Analyses on the dynamic strength of honeycombs under the y-directional crushing, Materials and Design, 53, pp. 293-301, (2014); Li, Zhen, Design-oriented crushing analysis of hexagonal honeycomb core under in-plane compression, Composite Structures, 187, pp. 429-438, (2018)",""

A series of drop weight impact tests were conducted on sandwich structures comprising polyurethane foam, aluminum, and concrete. The investigation encompasses variations in the thickness of the polyurethane foam-aluminum absorption layer, the impact height, and different structural combinations, coupled with numerical simulations. Results indicate that as the thickness of the polyurethane foam-aluminum energy absorption layer increases, the energy absorbed by the composite structure also increases. However, the rate of this increase tapers off as the layer thickness continues to grow. The impact height influences energy absorption within a defined range, enabling optimal utilization of the deformation and energy absorption capacities of the polyurethane foam-aluminum layer. Notably, the double-sandwich structure outperforms the single-sandwich structure in terms of impact resistance. The incorporation of the polyurethane foam-aluminum sandwich structure significantly enhances the impact resilience of concrete. Among the tested configurations, the double-sandwich structure composed of polyurethane foam, aluminum, and concrete exhibits the optimal absorption performance. Nevertheless, the layered nature of the structure significantly increases its construction complexity, potentially impacting the practical feasibility of utilizing the polyurethane foam-aluminum-concrete composite structure in real-world applications. © 2024 by the authors.","concrete; impact test; numerical simulation; polyurethane foam-aluminum; sandwich structure","Composite structures; Convergence of numerical methods; Honeycomb structures; Rigid foamed plastics; Structural optimization; Absorption layer; Composites structures; Energy; Foam aluminium; Foam aluminum; Foam concretes; Impact test; Polyurethane concretes; Polyurethane Foam; Polyurethane foam-aluminum; Sandwich structures","Izadifar, Mohammadreza, Theoretical Elastic Constants of Tobermorite Enhanced with Reduced Graphene Oxide through Hydroxyl vs Epoxy Functionalization: A First-Principles Study, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 127, 36, pp. 18117-18126, (2023); Sharifi Ghalehnoei, Mohammadsina, Finite Element Analysis of Shear Reinforcing of Reinforced Concrete Beams with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Grid-Strengthened Engineering Cementitious Composite, Buildings, 13, 4, (2023); Ul Haq, Inzimam, Mechanical and durability performance of concrete mixtures incorporating bentonite, silica fume, and polypropylene fibers, Construction and Building Materials, 345, (2022); Rodsin, Kittipoom, Behavior of steel clamp confined brick aggregate concrete circular columns subjected to axial compression, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 16, (2022); Joyklad, Panuwat, Effect of fired clay brick aggregates on mechanical properties of concrete, Suranaree Journal of Science and Technology, 25, 4, pp. 349-362, (2018); Merrett, Robert P., The blast and impact loading of aluminium foam, Materials and Design, 44, pp. 311-319, (2013); Cheng, Yuansheng, Damage Response Characteristics of UHMWPE/aluminum Foam Composite Sandwich Panel Subjected to Combined Blast and Fragment Loadings, Binggong Xuebao/Acta Armamentarii, 42, 8, pp. 1753-1762, (2021); Karagiozova, Dora, Propagation of compaction waves in metal foams exhibiting strain hardening, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 49, 19-20, pp. 2763-2777, (2012); Zheng, Zhijun, Dynamic crushing of cellular materials: Continuum-based wave models for the transitional and shock modes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 42, pp. 66-79, (2012); Liao, Shenfei, Dynamic crushing of 2D cellular structures: Local strain field and shock wave velocity, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 57, pp. 7-16, (2013)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Two scenarios, including global and local impact, are considered to reveal the characteristics of impact resistance. The effects of different impact energies and core densities on energy absorption and failure mechanism are thoroughly discussed. Meanwhile, the post-impact residual compressive strength is carried out to evaluate the influence of impact on structural strength and stability. The results show that under the global impact, the impact resistance is related to core density, and the energy absorption is mainly from honeycomb core. While under the local impact, as the impact energy increases, the failure mechanism of the structure changes from core crushing to penetration. The research provides a guidance for low-velocity impact performance and structural optimization design of sandwich structures. © The Author(s) 2024.","All-CRRP sandwich structure; failure mechanism; low-velocity impact; residual strength; stretching process","Bulk Density; Compressive strength; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Stretching; Structural design; All-CRRP sandwich structure; Core densities; Failure mechanism; Global impacts; Impact energy; Local impacts; Low velocity impact; Residual strength; Stretching process; Ultra-light; Sandwich structures","Osa-Uwagboe, Norman, Mechanical behaviour of fabric-reinforced plastic sandwich structures: A state-of-the-art review, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 25, 5, pp. 591-622, (2023); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); Kausar, Ayesha, State-Of-The-Art of Sandwich Composite Structures: Manufacturing—to—High Performance Applications, Journal of Composites Science, 7, 3, (2023); Tao, Qiangqiang, Energy absorption and impact behavior of composite sandwich panels under high-velocity spherical projectile, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 162, (2022); Liu, Zhengxian, Design and fabrication of an all-composite ultra-broadband absorbing structure with superior load-bearing capacity, Composites Science and Technology, 240, (2023); Wang, Yan, Low-velocity impact responses and failure of sandwich structure with carbon fiber composite honeycomb cores, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 192, (2024); Zhang, Yile, Investigation of bird-strike resistance of composite sandwich curved plates with lattice/foam cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Vignjevic, Rade, Soft body impact resistance of composite foam core sandwich panels with unidirectional corrugated and tubular reinforcements, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 132, (2019); Akatay, Abdullah, The influence of low velocity repeated impacts on residual compressive properties of honeycomb sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 125, pp. 425-433, (2015); Giannaros, Efthimios, Low- and high-fidelity modeling of sandwich-structured composite response to bird strike, as tools for a digital-twin-assisted damage diagnosis, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 160, (2022)",""

The proposed customised manufacturing process allows for the production of cores with varying density values (ranging from 0.37 to 0.63 g/cm3). Both graded cores, with varying fibre content through the thickness, and non-graded cores were produced. The mechanical properties of these cores were evaluated under flexural and compressive testing with specific flexural strength reaching approximately 80 MPa·cm3/g and specific compressive elastic modulus around 340 MPa·cm3/g. Additionally, to assess their impact performance in sandwich panels, hybrid panels with CFRP skins were fabricated and subjected to Low Velocity Impact tests at 25 J, 45 J and 50 J. The results revealed that optimizing core density had increasingly beneficial effects as the impact energy increased. These findings suggest that the possibility of customising failure modes and tailor energy absorption capabilities of the proposed structures open the way for new, exciting perspectives for the development of innovative sandwich structures, broadening the application of natural fibres in various industrial sectors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.","Graded; Hemp; Hybrid composites; LVI; Natural fibres; Sandwich","Bending strength; Bulk Density; Compressive strength; Hemp; Hemp fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Sandwich structures; Bio-inspired optimizations; Design strategies; Graded; LVI; Mechanical analysis; Optimization design; Production analysis; Sandwich; Sandwich laminates; Compression testing","Fan, Hualin, Sandwich panels with Kagome lattice cores reinforced by carbon fibers, Composite Structures, 81, 4, pp. 533-539, (2007); Valentine, Max D.A., Additively manufactured cure tools for composites manufacture, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 127, 9-10, pp. 4237-4251, (2023); Giusto, Giovangiuseppe, Composite grid structure technology for space applications, Materials Today: Proceedings, 34, pp. 332-340, (2019); Sandwich Structures 7 Advancing with Sandwich Structures and Materials, (2005); Abdulrahim, Moshood Yemi, Experimental correlation between process parameters and impact energy of value-added banana stem fibres and cow horn particles/polyester hybrid composites, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 110, 7-8, pp. 1701-1708, (2020); Benkhelladi, Asma, Tensile and flexural properties of polymer composites reinforced by flax, jute and sisal fibres, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 108, 3, pp. 895-916, (2020); Sorrentino, Luca, RIFT Process Analysis for the Production of Green Composites in Flax Fibers and Bio-Based Epoxy Resin, Materials, 15, 22, (2022); K K Cavalcanti, Daniel K.K., Mechanical characterization of intralaminar natural fibre-reinforced hybrid composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 175, (2019); Perna, A.

The numerical modelling of the efficient HCHSS was developed for the core, front and back face plate using the C3D8R elements to determine the realistic failure behaviour for the honeycomb sandwich structure. The ConWep blast simulation loading was applied for the HCHSS. Advanced composite materials were used for the blast analysis of the HCHSS (carbon/epoxy, graphite/epoxy, woven basalt fibres/polypropylene and woven Kevlar fibres/polypropylene). The damage initiation and damage propagation based progressive damage modelling was developed and implemented in the VUMAT code for composite materials to determine the actual failure behaviour of the HCHSS. The face sheets used in this model were of a stainless-steel alloy AL-6XN. The sandwich structure was subjected to blast loads of 1, 2 and 3 kg of TNT and their performance was compared w.r.t both front and back-face deflection. The effectiveness of sandwich panels was further examined by altering the thickness of the core. Fibre-metal laminates (FML) were used in place of the steel face sheets in the panel in order to minimise its mass, and a thorough analysis of the panel’s mass in relation to its peak deflection was carried out. Upon analysing the results, it was noted that the panel with the basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) core gave the best results compared to other composite materials. For a blast load of 3 kg TNT, the peak back face deflection (PBFD) of HCHSS with a BFRP core decreased by 10.64%, 7.61% and 4.75%, respectively, compared to panels with CFRP, GFRP, and KFRP cores. The peak deflection of the panel decreased as the BFRP core thickness increased. The energy absorption capacity of the panel also increased with increasing thickness. Additionally, it was found that panels with BFRP cores and KFRP-steel laminate face sheets provided the optimum balance of strong blast resistant performance and light weight. Compared to the metallic (steel) sandwich panel, the mass of the sandwich panel with KFRP-steel laminate face sheets and BFRP core was reduced by 33%, but at the same time, its PBFD increased by almost 50%. © IMechE 2024.","Blast load; composites; core optimisation; fibre-metal laminates; finite element modelling; sandwich panel; TNT","ABAQUS; Alloy steel; Basalt; Blast resistance; Composite beams and girders; Deflection (structures); Dynamic loads; Fatigue testing; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Forecasting; Glass ceramics; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Laminated composites; Plates (structural components); Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Blast loads; Core optimization; Element models; Fibre Metal Laminates; Finite element modeling; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Optimisations; Sandwich panel; TNT; Steel fibers","Theobald, M.

The optimization of auxetic structures’ geometrical parameters can improve their performance. This research aims to optimize the design of an auxetic structure for maximum specific energy absorption and investigate its behavior under quasi-static compressive and high-velocity impact loading. The geometrical parameters of the cross-petal auxetic structure are optimized using genetic algorithm and a neural network surrogate model. The behavior of the optimized auxetic structure is examined in quasi-static compressive loading and compared with that of the basic auxetic structure using finite element simulations. The optimized auxetic structure is then evaluated in high-velocity impact loading as the core of a sandwich panel, with two plates placed in the front and rear. Simulations of projectile impacts at velocities ranging from 100 to 250 m/s reveal the sandwich panel’s behavior. Results indicate a 69.82% increase in specific energy absorption capacity for the optimized auxetic structure as compared to the basic structure in quasi-static compressive loading.

The split-ring resonators effectively induce bandgaps below 3 kHz, and the mechanisms of bandgap generation and polarization are studied through mode shapes, frequency contours and equivalent mass densities. Subsequently, a machine learning-based optimization framework is introduced to tailor the bandgaps, leading to a 155.59% increase in bandgap width. Furthermore, superior vibration isolation and impact mitigation are confirmed through experiments. Obvious attenuation peaks are observed in the bandgaps of the acceleration transmission spectrum in frequency domain. In time domain, the impact test demonstrates peak weakening and delay.

Assessment of the dynamic response of the structures under explosive loading through experimentation is costly, with many restrictions, and highly harmful for both people and the environment. Hence, the present study deals with an explicit numerical investigation of the protective sandwich structures’ blast performance. The influence of the number of stages of honeycomb on the sandwich structures’ blast mitigation capacity was evaluated with the effective utilization of face sheets’ material as their intermediate sheets while maintaining the total volumes as well as masses of the structure's constant. The explosive loads of 1 to 3 kg of trinitrotoluene were used for the stand-off distance of 100 mm. The rate-dependent Johnson-Cook plasticity model was implemented on the designed sandwich models to discover their damage behaviors. The sandwiches’ face deflection, energy absorption, kinetic energy variation, and crushing behaviors were considered to characterize their blast mitigation capacity. The obtained results showed that increasing the number of stages of core in the sandwich structure by using a fraction of the back face sheet materials for intermediate sheets significantly improved their blast performance without increasing their volume occupancies and masses. For the two-stage and three-stage sandwich designs, 50% and 20%, respectively, utilization of their back face material for their intermediate sheet was found to be optimal. © IMechE 2024.","Deformation; energy absorption; explosive loading; multistage sandwich; trinitrotoluene","Dynamic response; Explosives; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Sandwich structures; Structural optimization; Blast mitigation; Design optimization; Dynamic response optimization; Explosive loadings; Face sheets; Multi-stages; Multistage sandwich; Performance; Sheet material; Trinitrotoluene; Energy absorption","Patel, Murlidhar, Blast analysis of efficient honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP/Steel FML skins, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 178, (2023); Kasilingam, Senthil, Mitigation strategies of underground tunnels against blast loading, International Journal of Protective Structures, 13, 1, pp. 21-44, (2022); Grujicic, Mica, Use of aluminum foam core sandwich structures to improve the blast-mitigation performance of light tactical vehicle side-vent-channel solution, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 232, 12, pp. 993-1011, (2018); Geramizadeh, H., Numerical and experimental investigation for enhancing the energy absorption capacity of the novel three-dimensional printed sandwich structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 235, 7, pp. 1622-1634, (2021); Xiao, Weifang, Influence of charge shape and point of detonation of high explosive cylinders detonated on ground surface on blast-resistant design, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 181, (2020); Belarbi, Mohamed Ouejdi, Finite element bending analysis of symmetric and non-symmetric functionally graded sandwich beams using a novel parabolic shear deformation theory, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 235, 11, pp. 2482-2504, (2021); Monteiro, J.

However, the wavelength of this radar wave is relatively short; thus, designing and preparing both broadband and wide-angle radar wave absorbers in this band presents considerable challenges. In this study, a resin-based K-band radar wave absorber with a biomimetic lotus leaf structure was designed and formed by UV curing. Here, microscale lotus leaf papillae and antireflection structures were prepared using a DLP 3D printer, and the contact angle between the material and water droplets was increased from 56° to 130°. In addition, the influence of the geometric parameters of the lotus leaf antireflection structure on the electromagnetic absorption performance and mechanical strength was investigated. After simulation optimization, the maximum electromagnetic loss of the lotus leaf structure 3D-printed sample was −32.3 dB, and the electromagnetic loss was below −10 dB in the 20.8–26.5 GHz frequency range. When the radar incidence angle was 60°, the maximum electromagnetic loss was still less than −10 dB. The designed lotus leaf structure has a higher mechanical energy absorption per unit volume (337.22 KJ/m3) and per unit mass (0.55 KJ/Kg) than commonly used honeycomb lightweight structures during the elastic deformation stage, and we expect that the designed structure can be used as an effective lightweight material for K-band radar stealth. © 2024 by the authors.","3D printing technology; biomimetic lotus leaf antireflection structure; K-band radar stealth; lightweight material; self-cleaning surface; UV-cured polymer composites","Electric towers; Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; Photocomposition; Printing presses; Radar absorbing materials; Solar buildings; Stealth technology; Surface cleaning; 3-D printing; 3d printing technology; 3D-printing; Antireflection structures; Biomimetic lotus leaf antireflection structure; K bands; K-band radar stealth; Lightweight materials; Lotus leaves; Polymer composite; Printing technologies; Radar stealth; Self-cleaning surfaces; UV-cured polymer composite; UV-cured polymers; Self cleaning surfaces","Shirke, Nidi, Recent advances in stealth coating, Polymer Bulletin, 81, 11, pp. 9389-9418, (2024); Li, Chen, Interfacial engineering of core–shell structured FeCoNi@SnO2 magnetic composites for tunable radar-infrared compatible stealth, Chemical Engineering Journal, 481, (2024); Calvo-de la Rosa, Jaume, New Approach to Designing Functional Materials for Stealth Technology: Radar Experiment with Bilayer Absorbers and Optimization of the Reflection Loss, Advanced Functional Materials, 34, 6, (2024); Ma, Jian, A radar-infrared compatible stealth metamaterial with bird's nest morphology, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 986, (2024); El-Hameed, Anwer S.Abd, An Improved Performance Radar Sensor for K-Band Automotive Radars, Sensors, 23, 16, (2023); Cui, Jian, Ocean wave measurement using short-range K-band narrow beam continuous wave radar, Remote Sensing, 10, 8, (2018); Li, Yingchun, 3D target localization of modified 3D MUSIC for a triple-channel K-band radar, Sensors, 18, 5, (2018); Bakhshi, Mehran, Enhancing long-range radar (LRR) automotive applications: Utilizing metasurface structures to improve the performance of K-band Longitudinal Slot Array Antennas, AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications, 176, (2024); Dewangan, Laxmikant K., Broadband metamaterial absorber for stealth applications at K-band, AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications, 170, (2023); Dewangan, Laxmikant K., Direction independent broad-band wide angle metamaterial absorber for “K” band applications, Frequenz, 78, 1-2, pp. 9-20, (2024)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Attention has been paid to CFRP structures in order to accurately simulate their progressive failure behavior and discuss their ply designability. In this study, the preparation process of a CFRP corrugated sheet (half of the honeycomb structure) and a CFRP honeycomb structure was illustrated. The developed finite element method was verified by a quasi-static test, which was then used to predict the low-velocity impact (LVI) behavior of the CFRP honeycomb, and ultimately, the influence of the ply angle and number on energy absorption was discussed. The results show that the developed finite element method (including the user-defined material subroutine VUMAT) can reproduce the progressive failure behavior of the CFRP corrugated sheet under quasi-static compression and also estimate the LVI behavior. The angle and number of plies of the honeycomb structure have an obvious influence on their energy absorption under LVI. Among them, energy absorption increases with the ply number, but the specific energy absorption is basically constant. The velocity drop ratios for the five different ply angles are 79.12%, 68.49%, 66.88%, 66.86%, and 60.02%, respectively. Therefore, the honeycomb structure with [0/90]s ply angle had the best energy absorption effect. The model proposed in this paper has the potential to significantly reduce experimental expenses, while the research findings can provide valuable technical support for design optimization in aerospace vehicle structures. © 2024 by the authors.","carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP); cushioning energy absorption; finite element simulation; honeycomb structure; low-velocity impact (LVI); progressive failure","Corrugated containers; Corrugated paperboard; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Structural dynamics; Subroutines; Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Cushioning energy absorption; Energy; Failure behaviors; Finite elements simulation; Low velocity impact; Low-velocity impact; Ply angles; Progressive failure; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","Dou, Hao, Research on drop-weight impact of continuous carbon fiber reinforced 3D printed honeycomb structure, Materials Today Communications, 29, (2021); Muthukumar, Chandrasekar, Low velocity impact properties of natural fiber-reinforced composite materials for aeronautical applications, pp. 293-313, (2018); Deng, Jian, A comprehensive analysis of damage behaviors of composite sandwich structures under localized impact, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 16, pp. 3231-3244, (2023); Tang, Enling, Characterization of dynamic compressive strength and impact release energy of Al/PTFE energetic materials reinforced by aluminum honeycomb skeleton, Composite Structures, 241, (2020); Mohamadi, Yousef, Axial crushing responses of aluminum honeycomb structures filled with elastomeric polyurethane foam, Thin-Walled Structures, 164, (2021); Foo, Choon Chiang, Mechanical properties of Nomex material and Nomex honeycomb structure, Composite Structures, 80, 4, pp. 588-594, (2007); Liu, Longquan, Impact resistance of Nomex honeycomb sandwich structures with thin fibre reinforced polymer facesheets, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 20, 5, pp. 531-552, (2018); Fan, Jinbo, Experimental Investigation on the Low-Velocity Impact Response of Tandem Nomex Honeycomb Sandwich Panels, Polymers, 15, 2, (2023); Gilat, Amos, Experimental study of strain-rate-dependent behavior of carbon/epoxy composite, Composites Science and Technology, 62, 10-11, pp. 1469-1476, (2002); Pinho, Silvestre T., Fracture toughness of the tensile and compressive fibre failure modes in laminated composites, Composites Science and Technology, 66, 13, pp. 2069-2079, (2006)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access"

The mechanical behavior and deformation process of the BHSS were compared through quasi-static axial crushing experiments and finite element (FE) simulations. The energy absorbing characteristics of the BHSS with different layers were compared through FE simulations, and the results indicated that the 4-layer BHSS displayed superior crashworthiness. Then, parametric studies were conducted to investigate the influence of layer-height gradient and wall-thickness gradient on the energy absorption performance and deformation modes of the BHSS. It was confirmed that the double gradient designs significantly reduced the initial peak force and improved the specific energy absorption of the BHSS. Finally, the multi-objectives optimization based on response surface method and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was employed to optimize the geometric parameters of the BHSS, aiming at the optimal configuration for better crashworthiness.

Equivalent to introducing chiral structures into the honeycomb structure, the final structural configuration is similar to that of origami honeycomb. The in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical properties of DLHH with different torsion angles and relative densities are studied through a combination of experiments and simulations. The results indicate that with the increase of torsion angle, the compression resistance and energy absorption capacity of the structure in the plane are effectively improved. However, the out-of-plane performance of DLHH decreases to varying degrees with an increase in torsion angle. In addition, it's found that the out-of-plane performance of DLHH with a 30° torsion angle is similar to that of TH, while its in plane performance is twice that of TH. The experimental and simulation results indicate that the deformation mode of DLHH during in-plane compression is affected by the torsion angle. When the torsion angle is 60°, there is a stable approximate horizontal layer by layer deformation mode, while TH and other angles of DLHH exhibit shear deformation mode.

In this study, a new bionic glass sponge–type honeycomb structure (BSH) with a quadrilateral octagonal mesh microstructure inspired by the sea sponge structure was proposed. The in-plane crushing performance of the BSH with different geometrical parameters under different crushing speeds was investigated by ABAQUS/Explicit. The numerical findings suggested that the BSH displayed stronger energy absorption in contrast to the square, hexagonal and hierarchical honeycombs at both quasi-static and dynamic crushing conditions. More plastic hinges and more unit walls involved in deformation resulted in a high energy absorption capacity. In addition, three typical deformation modes of the BSH under different loading speeds were discussed, and the empirical model to predict the plateau stress of the BSH was established based on the shock wave theory. Finally, the effect of boundary segmentation parameter m on crushing performance was also illustrated. The energy absorption capacity reaches a maximum at m = 3 for quasi–static loading, whereas at m = 5 for dynamic loading. These findings provide valuable insights into the optimization of bionic honeycombs. © 2024 The Authors","Bionic glass sponge–type honeycomb structure; Energy absorption; In-plane loading","Bionics; Crushing; Dynamic loads; Energy absorption; Geometry; Glass; Loading; Shock waves; Stress analysis; Bionic glass sponge–type honeycomb structure; Crushing performance; Energy absorption capacity; Glass sponges; Inplane loading; Quasi-dynamics; Quasi-static crushing; Sea sponge; Sponge structures; Sponge types; Honeycomb structures","Chen, Yanyu, 3D printed hierarchical honeycombs with shape integrity under large compressive deformations, Materials and Design, 137, pp. 226-234, (2018); Limmahakhun, Sakkadech, 3D-printed cellular structures for bone biomimetic implants, Additive Manufacturing, 15, pp. 93-101, (2017); Haghpanah, Babak, Self-similar hierarchical honeycombs, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 469, 2156, (2013); Oftadeh, Ramin, Mechanics of anisotropic hierarchical honeycombs, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 81, pp. 126-136, (2014); Liang, Hongyu, In-plane compressive behavior of a novel self-similar hierarchical honeycomb with design-oriented crashworthiness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 209, (2021); Ajdari, Amin, Mechanical properties of functionally graded 2-D cellular structures: A finite element simulation, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 499, 1-2, pp. 434-439, (2009); Wang, Yuyang, In-plane compression of graded hierarchical honeycombs, Advances in Structural Engineering, 25, 7, pp. 1483-1504, (2022); Wang, Yuyang, In-plane crushing behaviour of hierarchical honeycombs: finite element simulation and analytical modelling, Acta Mechanica Sinica/Lixue Xuebao, 39, 11, (2023); Liu, Hu, In-plane crushing behavior and energy absorption of a novel graded honeycomb from hierarchical architecture, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 221, (2022); Ha, Ngoc-san, Mechanical properties and energy absorption of bio-inspired hierarchical circular honeycomb, Composites Part B: Engineering, 236, (2022)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Lithium-ion batteries, as the mainstream choice of power battery for electric vehicles solving the problem that they are prone to thermal runaway due to damage when impacted, are the key to preventing and controlling fire accidents in electric vehicles. To address the protective problem of the bottom power battery of electric vehicles when it is impacted by road debris, two new types of sandwich structures with an enhanced regular hexagonal structure and semicircular arch structure as the core layer, respectively, are innovatively proposed in this article. They are used to protect the bottom power battery of electric vehicles and are compared with the traditional homogeneous protective structure in terms of protective performance. A local finite element simulation (FEM) of an electric vehicle containing the necessary components was established for simulation. Stress distribution, deformation, and energy absorption data for each component of an electric vehicle assembled with a protective structure when subjected to a bottom impact were obtained safely and cost-effectively. Three evaluation coefficients, namely, the cell shape variable (B<inf>cmax</inf>), the protective effect parameter (ƒ<inf>PE</inf>), and the total energy absorption of the structure (E<inf>a</inf>), are proposed to compare and analyze the simulation results of different protective structures under equal mass conditions. The maximum values of the battery deformation of arched sandwich construction and reinforced honeycomb sandwich construction were 0.35 mm and 0.40 mm, respectively, which are much smaller than that of the maximum deformation of the battery under the protection of a homogeneous protective structure, which is 0.62 mm. Their protective effect parameters are 43.55 and 35.48, respectively, which proves that the optimization degree of the protective structure of the bottom of the electric vehicle after the application of the new structure is 35% or more. The total energy absorptions of the two structures are 91.77 J and 87.19 J, respectively, accounting for more than 70% of the kinetic energy in the system, which proves that the deformation of the sandwich structure can effectively absorb the kinetic energy of the collision between the road obstacle and the bottom of the car. The final results show that the arched sandwich structure showed the best impact resistance in the simulation, which can be used for the power battery’s protective structure on the electric vehicle’s bottom. This study fills a gap in local finite element modeling in electric vehicle crash simulations and provides ideas for fire prevention designs of electric vehicle structures. © 2024 by the authors.","battery; bottom crash; finite element analysis; fire prevention; protective structure","","Lv, Li, Production forecast of china’s new energy passenger vehicles in 2021–2023 under the compliance of dual-credit policy, World Electric Vehicle Journal, 12, 3, (2021); Tan, Qingbo, Development Path and Model Design of a New Energy Vehicle in China, Energies, 16, 1, (2023); Wang, Shengyuan, Exploring the Sustainability of China’s New Energy Vehicle Development: Fresh Evidence from Population Symbiosis, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 17, (2022); Zhang, Hao, Subsidy strategy on new-energy vehicle based on incomplete information: A Case in China, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 541, (2020); Kulkarni, Shank S., Investigation of Crashworthiness of Carbon Fiber-Based Electric Vehicle Battery Enclosure Using Finite Element Analysis, Applied Composite Materials, 30, 6, pp. 1689-1715, (2023); Li, Qiqi, Multi-objective optimization design of B-pillar and rocker sub-systems of battery electric vehicle, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 64, 6, pp. 3999-4023, (2021); Lian, Yufeng, Lateral Collision Avoidance Robust Control of Electric Vehicles Combining a Lane-Changing Model Based on Vehicle Edge Turning Trajectory and a Vehicle Semi-Uncertainty Dynamic Model, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 19, 2, pp. 331-343, (2018); Pan, Yongjun, Crush and crash analysis of an automotive battery-pack enclosure for lightweight design, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 2, pp. 500-509, (2022); Zhao, Junchao, Experimental study on thermal runaway behaviors of 18650 li-ion battery under enclosed and ventilated conditions, Fire Safety Journal, 125, (2021); Kong, Depeng, Effect of low temperature on thermal runaway and fire behaviors of 18650 lithium-ion battery: A comprehensive experimental study, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 174, pp. 448-459, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Over the past two decades, many different topological structures including triangular, square, hexagonal, and circular units were investigated, and the basic mechanical responses of honeycomb structures under various load conditions, including tension, compression, buckling, shear, and fatigue were studied. To further improve the performance of the honeycombs, appropriate optimizations were also carried out. However, the mechanical properties of a single lattice often struggle to exceed the upper limit of its structure. This paper investigates the effect of permutation and hybrid mode on the mechanical properties of CFRCLSs by comparing five structures: rhomboid (R-type), octagon orthogonal array (OOA-type), octagon hypotenuse array (OHA-type), octagon nested array (ONA-type), and rhomboid circle (RC-type), with the conventional hexagonal structure (H-type). CFRCLS samples are fabricated using fused filament fabrication (FFF), with carbon-fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) as the matrix. The in-plane compression properties, energy absorption characteristics, and deformation behaviors of the hybrid structures were studied by experimental tests. The results demonstrate that different permutation and hybrid modes alter the deformation behaviors and mechanical properties of the structures. Taking elastic modulus as an example, the values of H-type, R-type, OOA-type, OHA-type, ONA-type, and RC-type are, respectively, 6.08 MPa, 5.76 MPa, 19.0 MPa, 10.3 MPa, 31.7 MPa, and 73.2 MPa, while the ratio of their masses is 1:1:1.10:1.52:1.66. Furthermore, hybrid lattice structures exhibit significantly improved mechanical properties compared to single lattice structures. Compared to the single structure R-type, the RC-type increases elastic modulus, yield strength, and energy absorption, respectively, by 12.7 times, 5.4 times, and 4.4 times. © 2024 by the authors.","continuous carbon-fiber-reinforced composite; hybrid lattice structures; multiple permutations; path arrangement","Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Structural properties; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Composite lattices; Continuous carbon-fiber-reinforced composite; Continuous fibers; Fibre-reinforced composite; Hybrid lattice; Hybrid lattice structure; Lattice structures; Multiple permutation; Path arrangement; Elastic moduli","Advanced Composite Materials for Aerospace Engineering Processing Properties and Applications, (2016); Mallick, Pankaj Kumar, Fiber-reinforced composites: Materials, manufacturing, and design, third edition, pp. 1-621, (2007); Rajak, Dipen Kumar, Fiber-reinforced polymer composites: Manufacturing, properties, and applications, Polymers, 11, 10, (2019); Seydibeyoĝlu, Mehmet Özgür, Fiber Technology for Fiber-Reinforced Composites, pp. 1-325, (2017); Thyavihalli Girijappa, Yashas Gowda, Polymer matrix-natural fiber composites: An overview, Cogent Engineering, 5, 1, (2018); Cheng, Ping, 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composite lightweight structures: A review and outlook, Composites Part B: Engineering, 250, (2023); Jayan, Jitha Santhakumari, An introduction to fiber reinforced composite materials, pp. 1-24, (2021); Whitney, James M., Elastic properties of fiber reinforced composite materials, AIAA Journal, 4, 9, pp. 1537-1542, (1966); Touhid Alam Ansari, Md Touhid Alam, Fatigue damage analysis of fiber-reinforced polymer composites—A review, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 37, 9, pp. 636-654, (2018); Helou, Mark, Design, analysis and manufacturing of lattice structures: An overview, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 31, 3, pp. 243-261, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

As a particular example, it is known that the reaction force of a typical negative-stiffness honeycomb (NSH) metastructure under compression will not monotonically increase with displacement, but manifests successive local extremums. This makes it an attractive choice as a concept for energy-absorbing applications, especially for recurrent low-velocity collision scenarios. Here, we analytically derive the equations of the piecewise-defined force–displacement functions for the general case of an NSH two-dimensional lattice metastructure followed by finding the optimal geometric design parameters. Using analytical methods, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental upper limit of 5/6 to the energy absorption efficiency of such metastructures. The obtained theoretical results are validated by finite-element numerical simulations and experimental compression tests. The findings of this study enable designers to identify optimal geometries of NSH metastructures for different practical applications with particular requirements on maximum reaction force and displacement. © 2024 The Authors","Elastic deformation; Energy absorption efficiency; Mechanical metamaterial; Negative-stiffness honeycomb metastructure; Optimal structural design","Absorption efficiency; Compression testing; Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Stiffness; Structural design; Structural optimization; Curved beams; Design and Development; Energy absorption efficiency; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Metastructures; Negative stiffness; Negative-stiffness honeycomb metastructure; Optimal structural designs; Reaction forces; Energy absorption","Lakes, Roderic S., Deformation mechanisms in negative Poisson's ratio materials: structural aspects, Journal of Materials Science, 26, 9, pp. 2287-2292, (1991); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Choi, J.

The deformation modes and energy absorption of the designed honeycomb are analyzed by using three methods including finite element, compression experiment and machine learning methods. A fully connected two-hidden layer backpropagation deep neural network (BP-DNN) is developed to predict the energy absorptions of the honeycomb with different geometric parameters. It is found that the error of the validation set is low, and the average correlation coefficient of the validation set is 99.2%, which indicates that the neural network can obtain good predictions. The sensitivity analysis of the input parameters shows that the thickness t has the highest sensitivity, and the ratio of the length of the straight wall to the height has the lowest sensitivity to the energy. In addition, the neural network developed can also predict the mechanical properties of the honeycombs outside the parameter range of the training set and the results are consistent with that of the sensitivity analysis. The DNN provides a fast and accurate method for the energy absorption of honeycombs, which is expected to speed up the optimization and design process of honeycomb structures. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.","","Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Honeycomb structures; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Auxetics; Deformation energy; Deformation modes; Energy absorption properties; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb cells; Learning technology; Neural-networks; Specific energy absorption; Validation sets; Energy absorption","Jiang, Yulin, 3D-printed auxetic-structured intervertebral disc implant for potential treatment of lumbar herniated disc, Bioactive Materials, 20, pp. 528-538, (2023); Simpson, Jonathan, Crushing investigation of crash boxes filled with honeycomb and re-entrant (auxetic) lattices, Thin-Walled Structures, 150, (2020); Krishnan, Bharath R., Auxetic structure metamaterial for crash safety of sports helmet, Materials Today: Proceedings, 56, pp. 1043-1049, (2022); Bohara, Rajendra Prasad, Dual-mechanism auxetic-core protective sandwich structure under blast loading, Composite Structures, 299, (2022); Zhong, Ru, Mechanical properties of concrete composites with auxetic single and layered honeycomb structures, Construction and Building Materials, 322, (2022); Zhao, Modi, Plastic behavior of foam-filled negative Poisson's ratio beams, Engineering Structures, 273, (2022); Qin, Qinghua, On dynamic crushing behavior of honeycomb-like hierarchical structures with perforated walls: Experimental and numerical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 145, (2020); Jiang, Yunyao, 3D Printed Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterial with Chiral Cells and Re-entrant Cores, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Guo, Mengfu, Design and characterization of 3D AuxHex lattice structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 181, (2020); Hu, Lingling, Mechanical property of re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs under large deformation, Composites Part B: Engineering, 163, pp. 107-120, (2019)",""

The study employs a robust finite element framework to predict crashworthiness parameters and deformation under flatwise compression. Enhanced with damage criterion, it offers more realistic predictions, indicating no debonding in welded regions. Most energy is dissipated through plastic folding, making it suitable for high-energy absorption applications. Damage initiates at the corner of the flanges due to stress concentration, minimized by a design modification to barrel-shaped honeycomb, boosting crushing strength by 21 %.

By establishing the relationship between the height of the cell and the cell-wall angle, HCS with different gradient modes were designed. The developed machine learning (ML) framework consisted of a forward regression model based on neural network (NN) and an inverse optimization model based on generative adversarial network (GAN). The regression model surrogated finite element analysis (FEA) to rapidly provide corresponding mechanical properties for the generated data of GAN. To ensure that the generated data met the desired design targets, additional physical constraints were incorporated into the generator of the GAN. This ensured that the network output not only consisted of valid data but also exhibited superior impact resistance. The results demonstrated that the trained ML model optimized both specific energy absorption (SEA) and initial peak stress of HCS. It even discovered high-performance gradient designs that outperformed the original data, with a maximum energy absorption 49.5% higher than that of uniform HCS. Moreover, the gradient modes and structural parameters of superior designs were identified, which is of great significance for the gradient design of HCS under impact loading. As a general design approach, this ML framework holds significant potential for the optimization design of metamaterials in other structures or with different mechanical properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Generative adversarial networks; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Inverse design; Machine learning","Biomechanics; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Regression analysis; Cell walls; Design frameworks; Graded honeycomb; High impact resistance; Impact loadings; Inverse designs; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Regression modelling; Generative adversarial networks; artificial neural network; design; finite element method; loading; machine learning; optimization; regression analysis; structural analysis","Li, Lingbo, A novel hybrid auxetic honeycomb with enhanced load-bearing and energy absorption properties, Engineering Structures, 289, (2023); Charekhli-Inanllo, Mojtaba, The effect of various shape core materials by FDM on low velocity impact behavior of a sandwich composite plate, Engineering Structures, 294, (2023); Gao, Yang, Graded honeycombs with high impact resistance through machine learning-based optimization, Thin-Walled Structures, 188, (2023); Wang, Menghuan, Machine learning accelerated design of auxetic structures, Materials and Design, 234, (2023); Zhu, Yazhi, Cyclic behavior of ellipse and peanut-shaped perforated buckling-restrained braces, Engineering Structures, 291, (2023); Li, Jinghui, Deep learning-enhanced design for functionally graded auxetic lattices, Engineering Structures, 292, (2023); Jiang, Weizhong, An improved re-entrant honeycomb with programmable densification and multistage energy-absorbing performance, Engineering Structures, 301, (2024); Zhu, Yilin, In-plane elastic properties of a novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with zigzag inclined ligaments, Engineering Structures, 268, (2022); Zhu, Difeng, A novel elliptical annular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced stiffness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 262, (2024); Zhang, Xiaolong, In-plane elasticity of a novel vertical strut combined re-entrant honeycomb structure with negative Poisson's ratio, Thin-Walled Structures, 163, (2021)",""

The HSBs are composed of steel face sheets and an aluminium alloy honeycomb core filled with PUF. A comparative analysis of damage modes is conducted between conventional hexagonal and auxetic HSBs, considering both foam-filled and unfilled configurations. The results reveal that the HSBs with foam filling demonstrate significantly enhanced blast performance compared to their counterparts without foam filling. This superiority is evident in both global deformation and local damage characteristics. Furthermore, a well-validated numerical model is developed to examine the damage mechanisms of PUF-filled HSBs under blast loading. The investigation reveals that appropriate PUF filling methods can effectively enhance bending resistance while minimizing the decline in the energy absorption efficiency. Finally, a multiobjective optimization was conducted using the back-propagation (BP) neural network and the SPEA2 algorithm to identify the optimal position for PUF. By utilizing a reduced foam filling approach as opposed to completely filling the structure, the two optimized configurations show a decrease in deformation of 5.38 % with an equivalent specific energy absorption (SEA) or an increase in the SEA by 5.26 % with an equivalent deformation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic; Blast performance; Close-in blast; HSBs; PUF","Absorption efficiency; Filling; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Polyurethanes; Sandwich structures; Auxetics; Blast performance; Close-in blast; Foam filled; Honeycomb sandwich; Honeycomb sandwich beam; Performance; Polyurethane Foam; Sandwich beams; Specific energy absorption; Energy absorption","Wang, Yonghui, Response of energy absorbing connector with polyurethane foam and multiple pleated plates under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 133, (2019); Pietras, Daniel, Out-of-plane crushing response of aluminum honeycombs in-situ filled with graphene-reinforced polyurethane foam, Composite Structures, 249, (2020); Zhang, Guoqi, Energy absorption and low velocity impact response of polyurethane foam filled pyramidal lattice core sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 108, 1, pp. 304-310, (2014); Langdon, Genevieve S., The air-blast response of sandwich panels with composite face sheets and polymer foam cores: Experiments and predictions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 54, pp. 64-82, (2013); Yazıcı, Murat, Experimental and numerical study of foam filled corrugated core steel sandwich structures subjected to blast loading, Composite Structures, 110, 1, pp. 98-109, (2014); Yazıcı, Murat, Preferentially filled foam core corrugated steel sandwich structures for improved blast performance, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 82, 6, (2015); Karen, Idris, Designing foam filled sandwich panels for blast mitigation using a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm, Composite Structures, 158, pp. 72-82, (2016); Li, Zhejian, Numerical study of blast mitigation performance of folded structure with foam infill, Structures, 20, pp. 581-593, (2019); Cheng, Yuansheng, The effects of foam filling on the dynamic response of metallic corrugated core sandwich panel under air blast loading – Experimental investigations, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 145, pp. 378-388, (2018); Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020)",""

Additionally, our study demonstrates a strategic removal of cell walls at key positions, reducing material consumption without compromising specific energy absorption. By establishing comprehensive structure-property relationships, we offer valuable insights into the design and optimization of hierarchical cellular materials.

An impact finite element model of the subway vehicle’s anti-climb energy-absorbing device was established using LS-DYNA (v.17.2). The effects of the connecting diaphragm thickness, the inner and outer tube thicknesses of the thin-walled tubes, and the yield strength of the honeycomb aluminum on the energy absorption and impact force of the anti-climb energy-absorbing device were investigated. The results indicate that changes in the inner and outer tube thicknesses of the thin-walled tubes significantly affect the energy absorption and impact force of the anti-climb energy-absorbing device. However, changes in the connecting diaphragm thickness only increase the maximum energy absorption by up to 7.5% but have a significant impact on the maximum peak force. It was also found that the difference in energy absorption due to changes in the yield strength of the honeycomb aluminum is only 3.6%, suggesting that the yield strength of the honeycomb aluminum and the connecting diaphragm thickness have a limited influence on the crashworthiness design of the anti-climb energy-absorbing device. Furthermore, a multi-objective surrogate model characterizing the specific energy absorption and maximum peak force was established for the aforementioned four influential parameters using the response surface method. The model was then optimized using a genetic algorithm, resulting in optimal parameters that increased the energy absorption and specific energy absorption by 27.3% and 13.8%, respectively, compared to the original values, leading to a significant improvement in crashworthiness. The findings provide valuable references for and insights into the crashworthiness design and optimization of subway vehicles’ anti-climb energy-absorbing devices. © 2024 by the authors.","anti-climb energy-absorbing devices; crashworthiness; energy absorption characteristics; optimization; surrogate model","","Zhou, Hechao, Investigations on the vertical buckling of railway vehicle’s anti-climber, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 26, 2, pp. 171-181, (2021); Zhou, Hechao, Study on the Vertical Buckling of Railway Vehicle's Anti-climber, Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 55, 16, pp. 170-175, (2019); Gao, Guangjun, Experimental investigation of an active–passive integration energy absorber for railway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 117, pp. 89-97, (2017); Chinese Journal of Construction Machinery, (2018); Peng, Yong, Study on the collision performance of a composite energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 94, pp. 663-672, (2015); Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, (2022); Yin, Hanfeng, Crashworthiness optimization design for foam-filled multi-cell thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 75, pp. 8-17, (2014); Zhang, Zonghua, Crashworthiness investigation of kagome honeycomb sandwich cylindrical column under axial crushing loads, Thin-Walled Structures, 48, 1, pp. 9-18, (2010); Yao, Shuguang, The impact performance of honeycomb-filled structures under eccentric loading for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 123, pp. 360-370, (2018); Forsberg, Jimmy, Evaluation of response surface methodologies used in crashworthiness optimization, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 5, pp. 759-777, (2006)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

The rapid advancement of additive manufacturing technology provides technical support for the fabrication of non-traditional structures and further improves the energy-absorbing properties of bionic structures. This work proposes a novel bionic hybrid structure that consists of honeycomb-inspired thin-walled tubes filled with weevil-inspired diamond TPMS (triple periodic minimal surface) structures. The energy-absorbing properties and the deformation behaviors of these topologies under axial crushing loads were investigated using combined numerical simulations and experimental tests. First, the effect of filling quantity and filling distribution on energy absorption of the hybrid structures was investigated. Results show that honeycomb tubes and diamond TPMS structures produce a synergistic effect during compression, and the hybrid structures exhibit excellent stability and energy absorption capacity. The bionic hybrid structure improves specific energy absorption (SEA) by 299% compared to honeycomb tubes. Peak crush force (PCF) and SEA are more influenced by filling quantity than by filling distribution. The effects of diamond TPMS structure volume fraction and honeycomb tube wall thickness on the energetic absorptive capacity of the hybrid structure were furthermore investigated numerically. Finally, a multi-objective optimization method was used to optimize the design of the bionic hybrid structure and balance the relationship between crashworthiness and cost to obtain a bionic hybrid energy-absorbing structure with superior performance.

Inspired by the concept of functionally graded structure, this paper aims to design a novel NPT with honeycomb spoke graded thickness. Firstly, the in-plane mechanical characteristics of the thickness-graded honeycomb structures were investigated theoretically. On this basis, six thickness gradient honeycomb NPTs and one traditional uniform thickness honeycomb NPT were designed, and the static and dynamic mechanical properties of NPTs were investigated using simulation and experimental methods. The deformation features of the spoke were analyzed under the static state, and the contribution of different honeycomb structure edges deformation on the spokes was also discussed. The stresses of the spoke and road forces on NPTs under rolling conditions were studied and comparison with the NPT-4 with a uniform thickness honeycomb structure. The results indicated that the thickness gradient variation of honeycomb spokes has a significant impact on the load-bearing capacity of the NPT. The thickness of the spoke l<inf>2</inf> greatly influences the radial stiffness of the NPT.

The natural limpet, known for its resilience to mechanical loading, serves as inspiration in the present research to introduce innovative repairable core shells. Limpet-inspired shells with elasto-plastic and brittle behaviors are designed and 3D/4D printed using polylactic acid (PLA) filaments and resins via fused filament fabrication (FFF) and liquid crystal display (LCD) techniques. While PLA filament exhibits an elasto-plastic response with a shape-recovery feature, the resin results in brittle structures for LCD-printed design. The study demonstrates that the FFF-printed PLA shell can fully recover residual plastic deformations, while the LCD-printed PLA shell exhibits a mechanical fracture behavior very similar to the natural limpet with brittle properties. A nonlinear finite element model (FEM) is also developed to replicate the large deformations of the samples under quasi-static compression with a high level of accuracy. Experimental and numerical results reveal that the samples with material, mechanical behavior, and geometry close to the natural limpet result in the maximum energy dissipation per unit mass. Two bio-inspired cores are then tessellated to introduce a new class of sustainable sandwich panels with supreme recoverability, resiliency, and repairability. A three-point bending test is numerically carried out on sandwich panels using FEM, and their energy absorption and dissipation capacities are studied. Results demonstrate that the proposed sandwich panels can achieve almost 7.33 and 1.17 times higher energy dissipation per unit mass than those developed based on a recycled thermoplastic bottle cap core. This pioneering research sets a new benchmark for structural design in terms of resiliency, recoverability, repairability, and sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s)","3D/4D printing; Bio-inspired design; Repairability; Sandwich panels; Shape memory polymers","Brittle fracture; Elastoplasticity; Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Plastic bottles; Recovery; Resins; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Shape-memory polymer; Shells (structures); Structural design; 3d/4d printing; Aerospace sectors; Bio-inspired designs; Liquid-crystal display; Per unit; Recoverability; Repairability; Sandwich panel; Shape memory polymers; Softcore; Ductile fracture","Kamarian, Saeed, Hygrothermal effects on the buckling of soft-core sandwich plates with composite layered face sheets, Polymer Composites, 41, 10, pp. 4144-4169, (2020); Safarabadi, Majid, Experimental and numerical study of buckling behavior of foam-filled honeycomb core sandwich panels considering viscoelastic effects, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 8, pp. 3985-4015, (2021); Mehrpouya, Mehrshad, Investigation on shape recovery of 3D printed honeycomb sandwich structure, Polymers for Advanced Technologies, 31, 12, pp. 3361-3365, (2020); Yazdani Sarvestani, Hamidreza, 3D printed architected polymeric sandwich panels: Energy absorption and structural performance, Composite Structures, 200, pp. 886-909, (2018); Bai, Xiaohui, Heat transfer performance analysis on lattice core sandwich panel structures, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 143, (2019); Proença, Miguel, Acoustic performance of composite sandwich panels for building floors: Experimental tests and numerical-analytical simulation, Journal of Building Engineering, 32, (2020); Akbarzadeh, Abdolhamid, Dynamic eigenstrain behavior of magnetoelastic functionally graded cellular cylinders, Composite Structures, 116, 1, pp. 404-413, (2014); Zhang, Zhong, Out-of-plane compressive performance and energy absorption of multi-layer graded sinusoidal corrugated sandwich panels, Materials and Design, 178, (2019); Ha, Ngoc-san, Energy absorption of a bio-inspired honeycomb sandwich panel, Journal of Materials Science, 54, 8, pp. 6286-6300, (2019); Farrokhabadi, A., Experimental and numerical analysis of novel multi-layer sandwich panels under three point bending load, Composite Structures, 250, (2020)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Re-entrant honeycomb structures, a subtype of auxetic materials, have demonstrated superior mechanical characteristics. However, understanding the mechanical behavior of these structures at the nanoscale remained a significant challenge. To address this gap, the authors explored the influence of size on the deflection behavior of re-entrant auxetic honeycomb structures through non-local continuum mechanics.

By incorporating rotation into the two-dimensional (2D) cell element, a three-dimensional (3D) cell element is formed, which exhibits enhanced mechanical properties. The 3D honeycomb is obtained by arraying the 3D cell elements and is enhanced by adding longitudinal ribs to the honeycomb. The present study employs the ABAQUS/EXPLICIT software to investigate the correlation between various compression velocities and the crashworthiness and energy absorption capacity of a given system. The effects of different compression velocities on the 3D honeycomb deformation pattern and energy absorption performance are analyzed.

To achieve this, an optimization of the honeycomb design was carried out using a statistical tool by varying its geometrical parameters. A Box Behnken design was employed, using three independent factors: cell height, cell size, and cell wall thickness to assess its impact and their interactions on responses. The performance was evaluated using a multiobjective response to maximize impact energy absorption, achieve the target cushion factor, and balance relative density for lightweight design. Since the liner materials were subjected to flatwise compression and dynamic impact tests to assess the performance. Their behavior. The results revealed that the honeycomb core with a cell height of 15 mm, a cell size of 10 mm, and a cell wall thickness of 0.6 mm exhibited good behavior. The response surface analysis and contour plots were used to analyze the interactions and combined effects of variables on each response.

This study involved a quasistatic compression test and simulation of a corner-enhanced spiderweb hierarchical structure complemented by 3D printing. The deformation pattern of the common spiderweb honeycomb (CSH) was //-shaped. However, the deformation pattern of the honeycomb after corner enhancement tended to be monolithic, forming an X shape. The deformation characteristics of both the CSH and the first-order local cellular elements were analyzed. The corner-enhanced honeycomb cellular elements dispersed the load onto the inner wall to achieve a common load-bearing effect. Further numerical simulation analysis was carried out in conjunction with the experiments, and local destruction analysis was performed for single-cell elements. Corner enhancement could increase the plastic hinge energy absorption of the structure, with a first-order corner-enhanced spiderweb honeycomb (CESH-F) exhibiting a 46.3 % improvement in specific energy absorption compared to that of a conventional CSH. The layers were reinforced to compress the load uniformly, and a third-order corner-enhanced spiderweb honeycomb (CESH-T) had a 25.7 % improvement in specific energy absorption compared to that of the CESH-F. In addition, optimization was performed for corner-enhanced spiderweb honeycomb (CESH) according to different helix radii.

However, these designs often lack a comprehensive analysis of other mechanical properties, leading to subpar mechanical performance. Previous studies have explored the mechanical properties response of enhanced re-entrant honeycombs (ERH) under impact conditions, revealing limitations in optimizing the structure's performance with a single objective. Therefore, this study aims to enhance ERH structural parameters to achieve superior mechanical performance through theoretical derivations and geometric optimizations. The results demonstrate that the proposed theoretical model is consistent with finite element analysis and response surface (RS) predictions. Expressions for Young's modulus, specific energy absorption, and compressive strength are proposed, facilitating the identification of structural parameters that meet specific requirements during reverse design. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization approach optimizes the geometric parameters based on maximum energy absorption and compressive strength. The mechanical behavior of the optimized ERH is investigated using the finite element method, revealing the energy absorption capacity of 13.78 J/g while maintaining Poisson's ratio at -1.06. Additionally, the deformation mode of the optimized structure showcases enhanced stability compared to traditional honeycomb structures.

The proposal of structures exhibiting a two-stage plateau stress region is increasingly prevalent. However, the majority of currently available two-stage plateau stress structures are predominantly fabricated using 3D printing technology, which can incur substantial costs. Additionally, the majority of currently proposed two-stage plateau stress structures exhibit diminished plateau stress values and possess limited capabilities for energy absorption. The objective of this study is to develop an economically viable metamaterial that exhibits dual high-level plateau stresses and demonstrates exceptional energy absorption capabilities in two in-plane directions. Based on the concept of misplaced design and traditional reinforced honeycomb structures (RHC), a novel metamaterial named misplaced reinforced-honeycomb (MRHC) has been developed. Aluminum alloy component and stainless stee component are fabricated. After the implementation of the misplaced design, the MRHC structure exhibits a pronounced enhancement in negative Poisson's ratio effect. The influence of misplaced design on the mechanical performance of the MRHC structure, as well as the impact of horizontal cell wall length (l<inf>3</inf>) and rotation angles (α and β), has been investigated.

Firstly, the influences of honeycomb angle on localized deformation and the response of force are studied by an experiment. Experimental results reveal that the honeycomb angles have a significant effect on deformation and force. Secondly, a series of numerical studies are conducted to analyze stress characteristics and energy absorption under different angles (α) and velocities (v). It is evident that two variables play an important role in stress and energy.

Fifteen configurations of honeycombs of same mass including S-CIH, regular honeycomb (S-RH) and sinusoidal honeycomb (S-SH) structures are evaluated and compared in terms of the deformation behavior and compressive performances under out-of-plane compression, especially energy-absorbing capacity. The results indicate that the S-CIH structure achieves the improved energy absorption 8.859 J/g, over 40 % and 60 % than that of S-RH and S-SH structure with same relative density and mass, respectively. The mechanism analysis of the asymmetric corrugated walls disposed in cross and parallel in S-CIH, reveals that the magnitude of amplitude determines the buckling mode thus folding mode of walls, and the magnitude of amplitude gradient determines whether the whole honeycomb structure can achieve a progressive failure. Optimal structural ratio can enable S-CIH delay the complete failure and improve the long-term failure-resistance.

In this paper, to further enhance the mechanical properties of the re-entrant origami honeycomb metastructure, the bio-inspired hierarchical design is introduced on the re-entrant origami honeycomb metastructure, a novel hierarchical re-entrant origami honeycomb (HROH) metastructure is proposed. The crashworthiness of the novel HROH is researched under low-velocity and high-velocity impact. The results indicate a significant improvement in the energy absorption capacity of the novel HROH compared to both the conventional hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb and the re-entrant origami honeycomb. The plateau stress of the novel HROH under different compression velocities are derived by the two-scale method. And the theoretical results are in good agreement with the numerical results. Moreover, the influences of the dihedral angles and wall thickness on impact resistance also are studied. To increase the wall thickness will improve the plateau stress and SEA–strain curve of the HROH, while increasing the dihedral angles will diminish the plateau stress and SEA–strain curve. In addition, to obtain the optimal structure of the HROH, a multi-objective optimization method based on surrogate models and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed. The results exhibit high accuracy in the crashworthiness optimization.

The numerical models are established and its simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments. The results show chiral units have a significant enhancement on macro mechanical properties.

The interfacial responses and flat compression failure behaviors of the honeycomb are firstly analyzed. It is found that ultrasonic welding has both positive and negative effects on honeycomb performance. High-frequency vibration results in fiber waviness, which is beneficial to elevating both the bending resistance of the joints and the compression strength of the honeycomb. However, melted EDs also lead to resin-rich areas at the interface. Based on the findings, the multiwall carbon nanotubes/PEEK (MWCNTs/PEEK) energy directors are developed, providing new insights on optimizing the properties of the interface. The experimental results indicate that the interfacial node tensile strength is enhanced by 400 % (1267 kPa) with the MWCNTs content increasing to 7.5 wt%, and the optimized CF/PEEK honeycomb shows more superior specific energy absorption and specific compressive strength than those of the commercial light-weight honeycombs. Moreover, the joint failure behaviors are investigated thoroughly.

In this study, two optimization methods of energy-absorbing structures (EASs) are proposed from the material system and manufacturing method for fabricating gradient stiffness and hierarchical cellular structures, respectively. The gradient stiffness structure was prepared using different ratios of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filaments in different locations in the EAS. The gradient stiffness structure exhibited energy-absorption behavior corresponding to the strength of the printed material; this behavior decreased in the order of material strength from low to high, thus achieving controlled yield deformation behavior. Hierarchical honeycomb structures were prepared by combining three-dimensional (3D) printing with supercritical CO<inf>2</inf> foaming technology, which facilitated the simultaneous formation of both centimeter and micron-scale cellular structures. When the PVDF content was 30%, the average cellular size of the microcellular structure was only 3 μm, and the prepared hierarchical honeycomb structures exhibited higher energy-absorption efficiencies compared with the general honeycomb structure. The energy absorption per unit mass values in three different compression directions of the hierarchical honeycomb structures were 152.75%, 67.33%, and 56.91% higher, respectively, than that of the TPU honeycomb without foaming.

Minimizing brusing and damage can be achieved by designing energy-absorbing structures and packaging systems in order to ensure the long-term quality of fresh produce. The aim of this study is to investigate the response and bruise susceptibility of pears under impact loading conditions through finite element analysis (FEA) methods. In this paper, three impact heights (0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m), four impact material surfaces (poplar wood, rubber, cardboard, and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic), two packaging sizes (standard 0.22″ and sandwich lattice 2.1″), and three impact design structures (rigid, corrugated, and honeycomb) are considered. Based on mesh sensitivity analysis, a mesh element of 1.5 mm was adopted for all simulations, assuring the accuracy of results and considering the trade-off between mesh size and computational time. The response surface analysis approach was utilized in order to develop predictive empirical models related to pear bruising. Results revealed that the rubber-based impact platform yielded minimal bruise susceptibility at all heights, while standard-sized corrugated cardboard performed best at a height of 0.25 m. Furthermore, single, double, and triple layers of packaging cardboard were tested. We observed that adding a second soft layer of corrugated cardboard reduced the stress on the pear by around 33%. However, adding a third layer only reduced stress by 5%. The 3D-printed honeycomb ABS has potential as protective packaging but would require further investigations and parameter optimization. Stacking multiple layers of cardboard on top of each other is a cost-effective solution that could improve damping and, therefore, ensure good quality and increase the shelf life of the fresh produce. This study will help decision-makers select the optimal energy-absorbing material for cushioning and packaging designs in order to improve the handling and post-harvesting logistics of fresh produce. © 2024 by the authors.","bruise susceptibility; corrugated packaging; energy absorption; explicit dynamics simulation; finite element analysis; honeycomb; postharvest transport technology","","Al-Dairi, M., Mechanical damage of fresh produce in postharvest transportation: Current status and future prospects, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 124, pp. 195-207, (2022); A Study of Waste in the Cold Food Chain and Opportunities for Improvement, (2020); Ma, Lili, Multi-omics analysis reveals the mechanism of calcium-reduced quality deterioration in mechanically injured green pepper fruit, Postharvest Biology and Technology, 204, (2023); Satitmunnaithum, Junjira, Microbial population size and strawberry fruit firmness after drop shock-induced mechanical damage, Postharvest Biology and Technology, 192, (2022); Pathare, Pankaj B., Bruise Susceptibility and Impact on Quality Parameters of Pears During Storage, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 5, (2021); Hussein, Zaharan M., Effects of bruising and storage duration on physiological response and quality attributes of pomegranate fruit, Scientia Horticulturae, 267, (2020); African Journal of Rural Development, (2017); Opara, Umezuruike Linus, Bruise damage measurement and analysis of fresh horticultural produce-A review, Postharvest Biology and Technology, 91, pp. 9-24, (2014); Körzendörfer, Adrian, Vibrations and ultrasound in food processing – Sources of vibrations, adverse effects, and beneficial applications – An overview, Journal of Food Engineering, 324, (2022); Ngo, Tuan, Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Composites Part B: Engineering, 143, pp. 172-196, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

This study presents a unique design inspired by the traditional practice of sikku rangoli, a cultural tradition prevalent in the southern region of India, particularly in Tamil Nadu. Because it was novel, it was necessary to optimize the fundamental design for maximal outputs. In contrast to honeycomb structures, intercellular interactions are believed to contribute to the overall strengthening of the structure. By eliminating sharp corners from the structure, stress accumulation is prevented, resulting in improved stress distribution. Therefore, the design aspects that were deemed significant were taken into consideration and through the implementation of experimental design, an optimum design was determined. Utilizing the optimal base design as a foundation, the structure underwent several printing processes using diverse materials and incorporated multiple fillers. Furthermore, the structure was subjected to modifications employing the functional grading design concept. The study employed the functional grading design concept to examine the variations in load bearing capability, load distribution, and failure mode. The findings indicate that the compression strength of the composite structure was mostly influenced by the wall thickness. The combination of a carbon fiber reinforced base material with silicone rubber as filler, together with a functional graded cell structure featuring top and bottom densification, exhibited the highest compression strength compared to all other combinations. In order to investigate the accurate impact of the FG structures, every cell design was printed using PLA-CF, subjected to testing devoid of any additives, and the output parameters were computed. The results indicated that the center densified cell design exhibited significant values for specific energy absorption, relative density, and compressive strength (52.63 MPa, 0.652, and 2.95 kJ kg−1, respectively). The design of the base cell exhibited the greatest crushing force efficacy of 0.982. © 2024 The Korean Society for Composite Materials and IOP Publishing Limited","compression test; failure mode analysis; functional graded cell design; pu foam; sikku rangoli cell design; silicone rubber","Additives; Cells; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Cytology; Failure (mechanical); Filling; Grading; Honeycomb structures; Silicone rubber; Cell design; Cell structure; Compression test; Failure mode analysis; Functional graded cell design; Functional grading; Pu foam; Sikku rangoli cell design; Fillers","Das, Arit, Current understanding and challenges in high temperature additive manufacturing of engineering thermoplastic polymers, Additive Manufacturing, 34, (2020); Yaragatti, Neha, A review on additive manufacturing of polymers composites, Materials Today: Proceedings, 44, pp. 4150-4157, (2020); Pal, Akhilesh Kumar, Additive manufacturing technology of polymeric materials for customized products: Recent developments and future prospective, RSC Advances, 11, 58, pp. 36398-36438, (2021); Salifu, Smith A., Recent development in the additive manufacturing of polymer-based composites for automotive structures—a review, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 119, 11-12, pp. 6877-6891, (2022); Madhavadas, Vaishnav, A review on metal additive manufacturing for intricately shaped aerospace components, CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 39, pp. 18-36, (2022); Haleem, Abid, 3D printed medical parts with different materials using additive manufacturing, Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health, 8, 1, pp. 215-223, (2020); Alghamdi, Saad Saleh, Additive manufacturing of polymer materials: Progress, promise and challenges, Polymers, 13, 5, pp. 1-39, (2021); Colorado Lopera, Henry Alonso, Additive manufacturing against the Covid-19 pandemic: a technological model for the adaptability and networking, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 16, pp. 1150-1164, (2022); Colorado Lopera, Henry Alonso, Additive manufacturing in armor and military applications: research, materials, processing technologies, perspectives, and challenges, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 27, pp. 3900-3913, (2023); Yadav, Devesh K., Design & fabrication of ABS part by FDM for automobile application, Materials Today: Proceedings, 26, pp. 2089-2093, (2019)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

This paper aims to propose a novel auxetic honeycomb structure manufactured using selective laser melting and study the enhanced mechanical performance when subjected to in-plane compression loading. Design/methodology/approach: A novel composite structure was designed and fabricated on the basis of an arrowhead auxetic honeycomb and filled with polyurethane foam. The deformation mechanism and mechanical responses of the structure with different structural parameters were investigated experimentally and numerically. With the verified simulation models, the effects of parameters on compression strength and energy absorption characteristics were further discussed through parametric analysis. Findings: A good agreement was achieved between the experimental and simulation results, showing an evidently enhanced compression strength and energy absorption capacity. The interaction between the auxetic honeycomb and foam reveals to exploit a reinforcement effect on the compression performance. The parametric analysis indicates that the composite with smaller included angel and higher foam density exhibits higher plateau stress and better specific energy absorption, while increasing strut thickness is undesirable for high energy absorption efficiency. Originality/value: The results of this study served to demonstrate an enhanced mechanical performance for the foam filled auxetic honeycomb, which is expected to be exploited with applications in aerospace, automobile, civil engineering and protective devices.

Re-entrant hourglass exhibits an acceptable equivalent elastic modulus and remarkable energy absorption capacity among various auxetic configurations due to their flexibility and hinge deflecting during crushing loads. This study introduces a curved hourglass honeycomb which can be produced using 3D printing with pure or reinforced filaments incorporating continuous fibers. New closed-form formulations are analytically derived using an energy method by considering an extracted unit cell to predict the equivalent in-plane mechanical properties for the first time. The plateau stress of the proposed honeycomb is evaluated at the densification state of a unit cell using the energy conservation theory, equating external work with plastic energy dissipation. The accuracy of these extended relations is validated against experimental outcomes, demonstrating good agreement between analytical and experimental results. Additionally, robust linear and nonlinear finite element analyses are conducted to assess the accuracy of the obtained relations, including the equivalent stiffness and plateau stress for structures produced with reinforced filaments. The nonlinear finite element code employs appropriate subroutines to model plasticity/damage events. Based on the established analytical relations for stiffness and plateau stress, multi-objective optimization using Genetic Algorithm is applied to define optimum values for the Pareto front chart's objective functions of stiffness and plateau stress. The optimization process involves exploring the design space and defining the values of geometrical parameters to achieve the desired objectives. In conclusion, this study presents a novel approach to developing curved re-entrant honeycomb structures, with analytical formulations validated against experimental and numerical results. Optimization helps to identify optimal configurations concerning stiffness and plateau stress, offering potential applications in lightweight and high-strength materials design. According to the obtained results, for selection of the best value for curved strut angle which results in the optimum value of stiffness and plateau stress, a range between 10°-34° can be considered depending on the volume fraction of fibers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Curved hourglass; Energy method; Equivalent stiffness; Experiments; Optimization; Plateau stress","Biomechanics; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Reinforced plastics; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Auxetics; Cellular structure; Curved hourglass; Energy method; Equivalent stiffness; Non-linear finite elements; Optimisations; Optimum value; Plateau stress; Unit cells; Stiffness","Farrokhabadi, A., Assessment of fiber-reinforcement and foam-filling in the directional energy absorption performance of a 3D printed accordion cellular structure, Composite Structures, 297, (2022); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); Wang, Su, Honeycomb structure is promising for the repair of human bone defects, Materials and Design, 207, (2021); Li, Dawei, Comparison of mechanical properties and energy absorption of sheet-based and strut-based gyroid cellular structures with graded densities, Materials, 12, 13, (2019); Yang, Kuijian, Quasi-static and dynamic out-of-plane crashworthiness of 3D curved-walled mixed-phase honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Hosseini, Shahram, Experimental and numerical analysis of shape memory sinusoidal lattice structure: Optimization through fusing an artificial neural network to a genetic algorithm, Composite Structures, 323, (2023); Niknam, Hamed, 3D printed accordion-like materials: A design route to achieve ultrastretchability, Additive Manufacturing, 34, (2020); Wang, Aijun, Yield surfaces of various periodic metal honeycombs at intermediate relative density, International Journal of Plasticity, 21, 2, pp. 285-320, (2005); Remennikov, Alex M., Development and performance evaluation of large-scale auxetic protective systems for localised impulsive loads, International Journal of Protective Structures, 10, 3, pp. 390-417, (2019); Yin, Hanfeng, Review on lattice structures for energy absorption properties, Composite Structures, 304, (2023)",""

Magnetic excitation is considered to be one of the most promising methods for special working environments; for which uniform incorporation of UV-cured four-dimensional (4D) printed resin is considered to be an effective approach to achieving fine structural features. Our study investigated the impact of soft magnetic particle content on the mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties of a shape memory polymer matrix material. This paper presents a 4D printed metamaterial with a zero Poisson’s ratio that can sense magnetic field intensity and alter its mechanical properties. Its rapid shape recovery, achieved through magnetic excitation, enables multiple energy absorption within a short timeframe. By increasing the curvature radius, the stress concentration in the hexagonal honeycomb structure is reduced, ensuring the metamaterial maintains its zero Poisson’s ratio even under in-plane loading. The study investigates the energy absorption performance and force-displacement curve of metamaterials with different layers and cell sizes, focusing on a four-layer metamaterial for the analysis.

Taking into account the core arrangements, the analytical model is formulated by employing an innovative yield criterion, to predict the impact force and deflection responses. The accuracy of the analytical predictions was confirmed through finite element (FE) results, and the influences of the core distribution, impact position, as well as core thickness on the impact behaviour of SPs were discussed. It is shown that the graded core SP exerts slightly inferior impact resistance than the uniform core SP. The closer the impact position is to the clamped boundary, the smaller the deflection of the bottom face-sheet and the greater the impact force. As the thickness of the core increases, the proportion of energy absorption attributed to the core also increases.

However, the large porosity property results in low stiffness, which limits their application scope. Current approaches to augment stiffness often result in diminished auxetic performance. Therefore, it is challenging to simultaneously enhance the auxetic, stiffness and energy absorption capacity of auxetic structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel elliptical annular re-entrant honeycomb (EARE) by introducing an elliptical annular structure into a conventional re-entrant honeycomb (RE) cell, which can provide extra longitudinal support without hindering lateral deformation. The plateau stress, Poisson's ratio and energy absorption properties of the EARE are investigated by quasi-static compressive tests and finite element modeling. The results show that the EARE honeycomb has two plateau stages due to the supporting effect of the elliptical annular structure. Compared with the conventional RE honeycomb with the same wall thickness, the EARE honeycomb not only exhibits a stronger auxetic effect embodied in the Poisson's ratio reduced by 5.19%, but also has a higher average plateau stress and a higher specific energy absorption of 171.63% and 28.03%, respectively, which significantly improves the stiffness and energy absorption performance. The parameterized analysis reveals that by appropriately adjusting the geometric parameters, the stiffness, energy absorption, and auxetic effect of the EARE honeycomb can be enhanced. The research findings address the conflict between auxetic performance and honeycomb stiffness, providing new insights into the optimization of honeycomb structure design. © 2023","Auxetic; Crushing response; Energy absorption; Negative Poisson's ratio; Re-entrant honeycomb; Stiffness","Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Structural optimization; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Crushing response; Ellipticals; Mechanical characteristics; Negative Poisson ratio; Performance; Plateau stress; Porosity properties; Re-entrant honeycomb; Stiffness","Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Zhou, Jin, Comparison of different quasi-static loading conditions of additively manufactured composite hexagonal and auxetic cellular structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 244, (2023); Teng, Xingchi, A simple 3D re-entrant auxetic metamaterial with enhanced energy absorption, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 229, (2022); Xu, Hanghang, Mechanical properties of aluminum foam filled re-entrant honeycomb with uniform and gradient designs, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 244, (2023); Chen, Zeyao, Re-entrant auxetic lattices with enhanced stiffness: A numerical study, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 178, (2020); Zhong, Ru, Mechanical properties of concrete composites with auxetic single and layered honeycomb structures, Construction and Building Materials, 322, (2022); Li, Zichuan, Indentation resistance of brittle auxetic structures: Combining discrete representation and continuum model, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 252, (2021); Vellaparambil, Rahul, Potential of auxetic designs in endovascular aortic repair: A computational study of their mechanical performance, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 138, (2023); Mir, Mariam, Macro-Scale Model Study of a Tunable Drug Dispensation Mechanism for Controlled Drug Delivery in Potential Wound-Healing Applications, Journal of Applied Biomaterials and Functional Materials, 15, 1, pp. 63-69, (2017)",""

To mitigate collision injuries, a workbench with energy-absorbing properties was developed, drawing inspiration from leaf-vein and honeycomb structures. A local collision model of a dummy compartment was established to evaluate the impact of different sandwich thicknesses on occupant injuries. By optimizing the wall thickness of the energy-absorbing sandwich, the optimal gradient parameters were determined. The assessment of occupant collision injury from the workstation table with a graded wall thickness sandwich was conducted using the LSTC Hybrid III 50th seating dummy. The results demonstrate that the workstation table influences the occupant's movement posture during a collision, preventing head impact with the tabletop.

The procedure of constrained-domain topology optimization is implemented with the aim of enhancing stiffness. The micromechanical finite element homogenization approach is used to evaluate the effective elastic-plastic properties of the CSPLs and their topologically optimized counterparts, TOCSPLs (Topologically Optimized Cuboidal Spherical Plate Lattices). The TOCSPLs demonstrate higher uniaxial, shear, and bulk moduli compared to the CSPLs, with an increase of 31%, 14%, and 36% respectively. Moreover, there is an increase in the yield strengths under uniaxial, shear, and hydrostatic loading conditions, with enhancements of 103%, 55%, and 62%, respectively. The topologies are additively manufactured through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) out of ABS thermoplastic material. The quasi-static compression experiments demonstrate the superiority of TOCSPL 111+100 over the other topologies in terms of uniaxial modulus. The suffix 111+100 denotes the crystallographic planar orientations in which the solid plate-like disks were formed within a cubic system. The topologies proposed herein outperform certain types of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface, honeycomb, truss-, and plate-based lattice materials.

Hybrid specimens are proposed considering thin-walled windowed metallic tubes filled with 3D-printed hexagonal honeycombs made of PET-G and ABS thermoplastic. The patterned windows dimensions vary from 20 × 20, 20 × 30, 15 × 20 and 15 × 30 mm2. Although using polymers in engineering and thin-walled sections is not new, their combination has not been explored in this type of structure designed to withstand impacts. Specimens resist out-of-plane quasi-static axial loading, and test results are analyzed, demonstrating that polymer core gives the samples better performance parameters than unfilled samples regarding energy absorption (E<inf>a</inf>), load rate (LR), and structural effectiveness (η). An optimization procedure using specialized software was applied to evaluate experimental results, which led to identifying the optimal window geometry (16.4 × 20 mm2, in case) and polymer to be used (ABS). The optimized sample was constructed and tested for axial compression to validate the optimization outcomes. The results reveal that the optimal sample performed similarly to the estimated parameters, making this geometry the best choice under the test conditions. © 2024 by the authors.","ABS polymer; honeycomb; hybrid energy absorbers; optimization method; PET-G polymer","3D printing; ABS resins; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Plastic bottles; Strain energy; Strain rate; Thin walled structures; ABS polymer; Compressive properties; Energy absorbers; Experimental optimization; Honeycomb; Honeycomb core; Hybrid energy; Hybrid energy absorber; Optimization method; PET-G polymer; Polyethylene terephthalates","Ravichandran, K., Synthesis of Nanocomposites, pp. 141-168, (2018); Patil, Akshat, An overview of Polymeric Materials for Automotive Applications, Materials Today: Proceedings, 4, 2, pp. 3807-3815, (2017); Rubio, Eva María, Analysis of the latest trends in hybrid components of lightweight materials for structural uses, Procedia Manufacturing, 41, pp. 1047-1054, (2019); Küçükoǧlu, Ayça, The joining techniques for thermoplastics materials in automotive industries: A comprehensive literature review, 12, (2016); Abdullah, N.

According to the two types of straw microcell and chamber structure characteristics, as well as the cellular energy absorption structure for the bionic optimization design, 22 honeycomb structures in 6 categories were considered, including a corrugated cell wall bionic design, a modular cell design, a reinforcement plate structure, and a self-similar structure, as well as a porous cell wall structure and gradient structures of variable wall thickness.

However, the structural integrity of conventional crash boxes is often compromised due to buckling deformations during collisions. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing functionally graded thickness (FGT) in hexagonal crash box design with honeycomb fillers to improve crashworthiness through multi-objective optimization. Finite element analysis using LS-DYNA was performed for axial and oblique impacts. Mesh sensitivity study indicated that constructing the FGT crash box with 41 layers yielded favourable outcomes, with simulation results differing by a mere 2.5% compared to experimental data. A surrogate model based on response surface methodology was employed to mathematically formulate the objective functions, which aimed to maximize specific energy absorption (SEA) and minimize initial peak crash force (IPF). Subsequently, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization was used to determine the optimal grading exponent of both outer and filler structures. The optimized FGT crash box demonstrated superior control over progressive deformation, exhibiting high SEA and reducing IPF compared to the uniform thickness crash box. Particularly, under oblique impact loads, using two grading exponents in optimizing the FGT crash box potentially achieved significant improvements in crashworthiness within the design procedure. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","Axial and oblique loadings; Crash box; Crashworthiness; Functionally graded thickness; Multi-objective optimization","Crashworthiness; Fillers; Grading; Honeycomb structures; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Axial loading; Buckling deformation; Crash box; Functionally graded; Functionally graded thickness; Impact energy; Multi-objectives optimization; Oblique impact; Oblique loading; Specific energy absorption; Multiobjective optimization","Shahsavari, Soodeh, Analysis of injuries and deaths from road traffic accidents in Iran: bivariate regression approach, BMC Emergency Medicine, 22, 1, (2022); Luján, Karen Viviana Pérez, Accidental injuries caused by automotive frontal collision, Latin American Journal of Solids and Structures, 18, 1, pp. 1-15, (2021); Repair of Vehicle Bodies, (2006); Kongwat, Suphanut, Safety Assessment and Crash Compatibility of Heavy Quadricycle under Frontal Impact Collisions, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 20, (2022); Li, Zhaokai, Crashworthiness and lightweight optimization to applied multiple materials and foam-filled front end structure of auto-body, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 9, 8, pp. 1-21, (2017); Xu, Xiang, Crashworthiness design of novel hierarchical hexagonal columns, Composite Structures, 194, pp. 36-48, (2018); Abdullah, N.

There has been an increase in interest in the integration of auxetic structures into these tubes. This is due to the better mechanical strength displayed by auxetic structures with negative Poisson’s ratio, particularly in terms of compressive behavior and energy absorption. In this study, a group of square-section tubes with different types of cell structures on their side faces was examined. Under quasi-static compression, the behaviors of thin-walled square tubes with reentrant auxetic and conventional honeycomb were examined numerically and experimentally. In addition, geometric optimization of reentrant cell shape was performed to maximize the compressive loading of the square tubes. First, the compression behaviors of thin-walled square tubes made of polylactic acid (PLA) were examined; these tubes’ side surfaces have both conventional and reentrant auxetic honeycomb cellular patterns. The reentrant auxetic and conventional honeycomb cell architectures were applied together and separately on the side faces of the thin-walled tube, with the identical cell parameters. In order to better understand the deformations, force-displacement curves were examined for four different types of thin-walled square tubes, including tubes with reentrant auxetic and honeycomb cell structures on all side faces and tubes with these structures on opposite sides and adjacent. Using the ANSYS finite element software package and Digimizer image processing programs, the Poisson’s ratio of the reentrant auxetic and conventional honeycomb configurations as well as the maximum compression force of the tubular structures were determined numerically and experimentally. After obtaining the result that the use of the reentrant auxetic structure on the side surfaces of the square tube significantly increased the compression resistance and energy absorption capability of the tube, the optimization of the square tube with the reentrant auxetic structure on all surfaces was examined. The effect of the geometrical parameters such as ligament length, reentrant angle, and cell thickness of the unit-cell on the compression load of the square tube was investigated using an integrated methodology combining numerical simulation and DoE (Design of Experiments) method. The findings show that the tubes combined reentrant auxetic structure exhibits better energy absorption than the conventional honeycomb tubes. It also reveals that the optimum geometric parameters of the reentrant auxetic unit cell are to be the ligament length of 16.358 mm, the ligament angle of 80°, and the ligament thickness of 3 mm. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","3D printing; Auxetic materials; compressive strength; numerical analysis; reentrant; stochastic optimization","3D printing; Cells; Compressive strength; Computer software; Cytology; Design of experiments; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Image processing; Numerical methods; Optimization; Thin walled structures; Tubes (components); 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Auxetic materials; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Reentrant; S ratio; Stochastic optimizations; Thin walled tubes; Thin-walled square tubes; Energy absorption","Hameed, Mohammed Hassooni, Enhancing the strength of reinforced concrete columns using steel embedded tubes, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 14, pp. 2008-2023, (2022); Chen, Mantai, Tests of cold-formed normal and high strength steel tubes under tension, Thin-Walled Structures, 153, (2020); Zvirko, Olha I., Application of the various methods for assessment of in-service degradation of pipeline steel, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 24, pp. 5058-5067, (2023); Yao, Lu, Experimental and numerical investigations of GFRP-repaired short steel tubes with dented damage under axial loading, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 11, pp. 2398-2416, (2024); Xie, Kaizhong, Study on the safety of the concrete pouring process for the main truss arch structure in a long-span concrete-filled steel tube arch bridge, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 28, 7, pp. 731-740, (2021); Yuan, Lin, Quasi-static impact of origami crash boxes with various profiles, Thin-Walled Structures, 141, pp. 435-446, (2019); Hussain, N.

A new objective function based on the European Standard has been developed in order to improve crash cushions capabilities while avoiding peak deceleration by using a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm.

Consequently, the deformation patterns and mechanical properties of curved beams under load have attracted many attentions. However, due to the nonlinear characteristics of variable thickness double curved beams, it is impossible to exhaust all possible structural forms through experimental and theoretical approaches. This paper presents a machine learning (ML) method for designing and optimizing double curved beam structures. The ML model is used to establish the underlying mapping relationship between thickness parameters and mechanical properties. After optimizing the double curved beam in different directions, the optimal thickness distributions of the backward snapping force and energy absorption are obtained. Double curved beams with optimal thickness distributions are used to construct multi-stable honeycomb structures, demonstrating the optimization process from single cell structure to periodic structure. Under the same mass, compared to the constant thickness honeycomb structure, the optimized variable thickness honeycomb structures exhibit a 140% increase in backward snapping force and a 57% increase in energy absorption.

In this paper, the design of three new aluminum alloy rotating thin-walled structures (NRTS) are examined. These structures combine common concave structures and rotating, rigid-body structures. The purpose of this study is to solve the problem of the poor energy absorption capacity of rotating, rigid-body structure due to small deformation and to provide a reference for honeycomb mechanism designs. The Young’s modulus, the critical velocity, and the platform stress of the NRTS structure are derived from theoretical analysis. The dynamic response of the NRTS structure at different impact velocities is investigated using finite element simulation software. The results show that the rotating, thin-walled recessed honeycomb (RTRH) increases the plateau stress by 124% and 51% as compared to rotating, thin-walled square tubes (RTSTs) and the re-entrant hexagonal structure (RH), respectively; the rotating, thin-walled quadruple-arc honeycomb structure (RTQH) increases the SEA by 21% and 20% as compared to the RTST and RH, respectively; and the rotating thin-walled double-arc honeycomb structure (RTDH) increases the CEF by 54% and 51% as compared to the RTST and RH, respectively. During the study, it was demonstrated that NTRS also exhibits good energy absorption capacity. Then, the effect of rotation angle on the energy absorption performance was analyzed. The cell and wall thickness of the NTRS structure were optimized according to the gradient theory. It was proved that the gradient optimized structure has better energy absorption performance as compared to the uniform structure. © 2023 by the authors.","energy absorbing structure; gradient optimisation; impact resistance; rotating rigid structure; thin-walled","","Acta Mater Compos Sin, (2023); Yang, Yan, Energy absorption characteristics of a super hexagonal honeycomb under out-of-plane crushing, Thin-Walled Structures, 189, (2023); Yin, Qianfeng, Analysis of heat transfer and thermal ablation of honeycomb sandwich composite structure under laser irradiation, Qiangjiguang Yu Lizishu/High Power Laser and Particle Beams, 35, 8, (2023); J Wuhan Univ Sci Technol, (2023); Wang, Weijing, Energy absorption characteristics of a lightweight auxetic honeycomb under low-velocity impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 185, (2023); Morin-Martinez, Armando A., The quest for a bidirectional auxetic, elastic, and enhanced fracture toughness material: Revisiting the mechanical properties of the BeH2 monolayers, Journal of Computational Chemistry, 44, 3, pp. 248-255, (2023); Li, Zichuan, Improving thermomechanical properties of cracked brittle honeycombs by negative Poisson's ratio effect, Composite Structures, 266, (2021); Liu, Yangzuo, Ballistic performance of double-arrow negative Poisson′s ratio structure, Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology, 45, 2, pp. 197-207, (2023); Du, Yixian, Topological design optimization of lattice structures to maximize shear stiffness, Advances in Engineering Software, 112, pp. 211-221, (2017); Zhong, Ru, Mechanical properties of concrete composites with auxetic single and layered honeycomb structures, Construction and Building Materials, 322, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Quasi-static out-of-plane compression tests were carried out to investigate the topological dependence of the crushing behavior of the buckling-induced honeycombs (BIHs). The results demonstrated that the crushing performance of BIHs can be artificially controlled by altering their shape parameters. In particular, the initial peak force (IPF) and the undulation of the mechanical response of BIH can be effectively reduced by increasing the layer number or arranging the asymmetric layers. A finite element model validated against experimental results was also utilized to reveal the underlying deformation mechanism and study the corresponding displacement-crushing force responses for BIHs with different topological parameters. It was uncovered that the buckling-induced mechanism is beneficial for tuning the stiffness and mitigating local buckling resistance through the pre-determined collapse behavior of cell walls. Further, a multi-objective optimization process of BIH was performed to seek the optimal design solution for energy-absorbing structures in specific scenarios. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for the development of new ideas and optimization solutions for the design of lightweight and performance-tailored energy-absorbing structures. © 2023","Buckling-induced honeycomb; Energy absorption; Initial peak crush force; Multi-objective optimization; Out-of-plane crashworthiness","Buckling; Compression testing; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Structural design; Topology; Buckling-induced honeycomb; Crushing performance; Design and analysis; Energy absorbing structure; Initial peak crush force; Model method; Multi-objectives optimization; Out-of-plane; Out-of-plane crashworthiness; Property; Multiobjective optimization","Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018); Ma, Fangwu, Multi-objective optimization of crash box filled with three-dimensional cellular structure under multi-angle impact loading, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 235, 9, pp. 2397-2412, (2021); Tan, Hailun, In-plane crashworthiness of re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio, Composite Structures, 229, (2019); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Moeini, Mohammadreza, Numerical homogenization of a linearly elastic honeycomb lattice structure and comparison with analytical and experimental results, Mechanics of Materials, 167, (2022); Guo, Yongguang, Deformation behaviors and energy absorption of auxetic lattice cylindrical structures under axial crushing load, Aerospace Science and Technology, 98, (2020); Sun, Guangyong, Crashworthiness of vertex based hierarchical honeycombs in out-of-plane impact, Materials and Design, 110, pp. 705-719, (2016); Liang, Hongyu, In-plane compressive behavior of a novel self-similar hierarchical honeycomb with design-oriented crashworthiness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 209, (2021); Zheng, Jie, Impact plastic crushing and design of density-graded cellular materials, Mechanics of Materials, 94, pp. 66-78, (2016); Shao, Yujie, Insight into the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the gradient auxetic reentrant honeycombs, Composite Structures, 274, (2021)",""

However, the performance improvement relying on regular configuration optimization and parametric study are relatively limited, because main plastic deformation only concentrates in folding line regions under progressive folding mode. To address this issue, 3D curved-walled same-phase chiral strategy is designed for honeycombs, and their crash performance is studied by experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis. The proposed honeycombs exhibit approximate progressive folding mode with controllable local compression-torsion coupling effect under out-of-plane loads. Therefore, the shearing energy is obviously increased, and the plastic hinge lines have been prolonged to increase bending energy. According to experimental results, the proposed honeycombs can achieve specific energy absorption SEA and energy absorption efficiency η respectively of 30.92J/g and 73.7 %, which are 14.6 % and 24.9 % larger than traditional honeycomb with same thickness. Moreover, their mean stress is effectively estimated based on plastic hinge analysis, and the contribution of coupling effect on crashworthiness is demonstrated. Furthermore, out-of-plane thickness gradient design can be implemented to further promote the crashworthiness. The proposed honeycomb with thickness gradient of Δt/t<inf>ave</inf>=1.5 displays SEA and η respectively 10.9 % and 23.1 % larger than the non-gradient model under same equivalent density.

Naturally available animal bones and plant stems are light in weight due to their natural cellular structures. This may inspire various researchers for integrating the various lattice structures such as beam, planar, triply periodic minimal surfaces, and voronoi structures on the various structural materials. The development of lattice structures using 3D printing technology has opened up major attention towards fabricating lightweight components without any complications. In this study, the detailed crashworthiness responses such as compressive strength was optimized in terms of varying the topology-related factors on the carbon fiber reinforced polyethylene terephthalate glycol (CF/PETG) composite. The experimentation was conducted concerning variable topology factors such as shell thickness, unit cell type, wall thickness (WT), unit cell orientation (UCO), skewing angle, and unit cell size. The model was examined and optimized by means of the Taguchi optimization technique. The crashworthiness response was analyzed using the compression test and moreover, this experimental response is used for the optimization processes. From the observation, the topology factors which contributed more for the higher compressive strength will be UCO of 65.47% and WT of 15.20%. Results of the regression study show that the R square value with concern to the compressive strength will be 92.74%. The optimized design parametric condition for CF/PETG composite established a higher compressive strength of 41.179 MPa, From the overall results, it is clear that the variation in the topology factors has developed a huge and favorable impact on the mechanical characteristics of the lattice-structured CF/PETG polymer composite.

First, the dynamic deformation process, deformation/destruction modes, maximum deflection, and energy absorption capacity of structures with different coating methods are studied and compared with uncoated structures. Based on this, the influence of polyurea coating thickness, blast center distance, and explosive mass on the anti-explosion capability of sandwich panels with optimal coating positions is investigated. Finally, performance optimization design of the sandwich panel with optimal coating position is carried out. The results indicate that polyurea coating is beneficial for improving the explosion resistance of sandwich panels, and the back side coated sandwich panel (type B) has the best blast resistance. When other variables of the sandwich panel remain unchanged, increasing the thickness of the polyurea layer may effectively suppress the maximum deflection. Meanwhile, increasing the distance between explosion centers and reducing the mass of explosives can significantly reduce the degree of damage to sandwich panels. Compared with the baseline model, the optimized structure shows a 17.9% reduction in the maximum backside deflection and a 66.1% increase in the specific energy absorption.

The conventional footpad is typically designed with an aluminum honeycomb structure that dissipates energy through plastic deformation. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in providing cushioning and energy absorption becomes significantly compromised when the structure is crushed, rendering it unusable for reusable landers in the future. This study presents a methodology for designing and evaluating structural energy absorption systems incorporating recoverable strain constraints of shape memory alloys (SMA). The topological configuration of the energy absorbing structure is derived using an equivalent static load method (ESL), and three lightweight footpad designs featuring honeycomb-like Ni-Ti shape memory alloys structures and having variable stiffness skins are proposed. To verify the accuracy of the numerical modelling, a honeycomb-like structure subjected to compression load is modeled and then compared with experimental results. Moreover, the influence of the configurations and thickness distribution of the proposed structures on their energy absorption performance is comprehensively evaluated using finite element simulations.

The SR (i.e., the initials of SIMP and RAMP) interpolation function, obtained by weighting the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) and Rational Approximation of Material Properties (RAMP) functions, is modified by adding the minimum elastic modulus term. The Optimal Classification (OC) algorithm is revised by adopting the volume constraint of Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO).

The failure behavior, strength, stiffness, and energy absorption of three-dimensional (3D) printed uniform and variable-density quasi-honeycomb sandwich structures are studied by three-point bending tests, and the evolution processes and distribution laws on the displacement and strain of cores are analyzed using the 3D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system. The comparisons between the experimental and numerical results are also carried out for the displacement and energy absorption of the sandwich structure, the bending strength of the face sheet, and the displacement and strain fields of the core. The results show that the bending strength, bending stiffness, shear strength, and energy absorption are enhanced after the variable-density topology optimization of the core, and the numerical values agree well with the experimental data. This study provides new ideas and important guidance for the variable-density design of quasi-honeycomb cores and the mechanical performance improvement of sandwich structures. © 2023","Bending and shear properties; Digital Image Correlation (DIC); Quasi-honeycomb sandwich structure; Three-point bending test; Variable-density core design","Additives; Bending strength; Bending tests; Biomechanics; Cytology; Ductile fracture; Honeycomb structures; Image correlation; Rational functions; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Stiffness; Strain measurement; Structural analysis; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Topology; Bending properties; Core design; Density cores; Digital image correlation; Digital image correlations; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Quasi-honeycomb sandwich structure; Shear properties; Three-point bending test; Variable density; Variable-density core design; Cells","Wang, Zhonggang, Crashworthiness of innovative hexagonal honeycomb-like structures subjected to out-of-plane compression, Journal of Central South University, 27, 2, pp. 621-628, (2020); Huang, Hua, Mechanical Properties of Honeycomb Composite Sandwich Structure with Applications to Precision Machine Tools, Hsi-An Chiao Tung Ta Hsueh/Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 53, 5, pp. 123-131, (2019); Li, Xiang, Out-of-plane crashworthiness of the new combined quasi-honeycomb core, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 3, pp. 826-834, (2022); Chinese J High Pressure Phys, (2022); Araújo, Hugo, The effect of geometry on the flexural properties of cellular core structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 233, 3, pp. 338-347, (2019); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels the Commonwealth and International Library Structures and Solid Body Mechanics Division, (2013); Wang, Xue, Natural frequency optimization of 3D printed variable-density honeycomb structure via a homogenization-based approach, Additive Manufacturing, 20, pp. 189-198, (2018); Teimouri, Mohsen, Topology-optimized hybrid solid-lattice structures for efficient mechanical performance, Structures, 29, pp. 549-560, (2021); Xiao, Mi, Design of graded lattice sandwich structures by multiscale topology optimization, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 384, (2021); A Study on the Mechanical Properties of Metallic Porous Structures Fabricated Using Selective Laser Melting and Its Variable Density Design Method, (2017)",""

The composite structure comprises an aramid honeycomb core supported by cylindrically shaped aluminum facesheets on both sides. Ballistic impact tests were performed by firing cylindrical projectiles, namely conical and hemispherical, using a pneumatic gun. Three-dimensional models of the composite structure with aluminum facesheets and an aramid honeycomb core were created using ABAQUS/Explicit. By utilizing numerical models, impact phenomena such as facesheet failure, core crushing, facesheet debonding, etc. were analyzed, which showed a high degree of similarity with a real impact scenario, thus validating the model. Furthermore, a parametric analysis was carried out using this model on different parameters affecting the composite structure. The study also examined the effect of these parameters on the ballistic responses of the cylindrical composite structure against both projectiles using a grey-based Taguchi analysis method.

Honeycomb structures are commonly used core materials in the sandwich composites. The elastic properties of honeycomb are characterized by foil thickness (FT) and cell size (CS) therefore they have significant effect on the mechanical properties. In this manuscript, low velocity impact analysis has been carried out on couple of aluminium honeycomb sandwich composites using Charpy ASTM E−23 machine and the energy absorbed by the sandwich specimens has been recorded. These experimental results have been validated through the numerical simulations carried out using commercially available software Abaqus. The results are found to be in good agreement. The parametric study also has been carried out to investigate the effect of foil thickness (FT), cell size (CS) and core height (CH) on specific energy absorption. Further, sufficient number of samples have been generated from latin hypercube samples (LHS) design and analyzed using Abaqus. Based on these results, polynomial equations have been generated in order to establish the relation between energy dependent variables (Energy absorption and Specific energy absorption(SEA)) and independent variables (Foil Thickness(FT) and Cell size(CS)).

The study of cellular solids is relevant by virtue of their enormous potential to exhibit non-traditional deformation mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to exploit the benefits of the FFF technology to fabricate re-entrant honeycomb structures using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to characterize their mechanical response when subjected to cyclic compressive loadings. Design/methodology/approach: Specimens with different volume fraction were designed, three-dimensionally printed and tested in uniaxial cyclic compressions up until densification strain. The deformation mechanism and apparent elastic moduli variation throughout five loading/unloading cycles in two different loading orientations were studied experimentally. Findings: Experimental results demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between volume fraction and apparent elastic modulus. The amount of energy absorbed per loading cycle was computed, exhibiting reductions in energy absorbed of 12%–19% in original orientation and 15%–24% when the unit cells were rotated 90°. A softening phenomenon in the specimens was identified after the first compression when compared to second compression, with reduction in apparent elastic modulus of 23.87% and 28.70% for selected samples V<inf>3</inf> and H<inf>3</inf>, respectively. Global buckling in half of the samples was observed, so further work must include redesign in the size of the samples. Originality: The results of this study served to understand the mechanical response of TPU re-entrant honeycombs and their energy absorption ability when compressed in two orientations. This study helps to determine the feasibility of using FFF as manufacturing method and TPU to construct resilient structures that can be integrated into engineering applications as crash energy absorbers. Based on the results, authors suggest structure’s design optimization to reduce weight, higher number of loading cycles (n > 100) and crushing velocities (v > 1 m/s) in compression testing to study the dynamic mechanical response of the re-entrant honeycomb structures and their ability to withstand multiple compressions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Cellular materials; Compression loading; Compression test; Fused deposition modeling; Mechanical metamaterials","Ability testing; Cellular manufacturing; Compaction; Compression testing; Elastic moduli; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Volume fraction; Apparent elastic modulus; Cellular material; Cellular solids; Compression loading; Compression test; Compressive loading; Deformation mechanism; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; 3D printing","Alomarah, Amer, Compressive properties of 3D printed auxetic structures: experimental and numerical studies, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 15, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Antolak-Dudka, Anna, Static and dynamic loading behavior of Ti6Al4V honeycomb structures manufactured by Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENSTM) technology, Materials, 12, 8, (2019); Askari, Meisam, Additive manufacturing of metamaterials: A review, Additive Manufacturing, 36, (2020); Bates, Simon R.G., 3D printed polyurethane honeycombs for repeated tailored energy absorption, Materials and Design, 112, pp. 172-183, (2016); Betancourt-Tovar, Mariajosé, Increasing displacement range in 3D printed compliant joints via bio-inspired slot patterns: An exploratory study, Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 35, (2022); Bhate, Dhruv, Four questions in cellular material design, Materials, 12, 7, (2019); Bourell, David L., Materials for additive manufacturing, CIRP Annals, 66, 2, pp. 659-681, (2017); Chen, Jiangping, Mechanical behaviors of 3D re-entrant honeycomb polyamide structure under compression, Materials Today Communications, 24, (2020); Chen, Zeyao, Re-entrant auxetic lattices with enhanced stiffness: A numerical study, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 178, (2020); Conway, Kaitlynn M., Effective area method for calculating global properties of cellular materials, Materials Today Communications, 17, pp. 144-152, (2018)",""

Sandwich panels with cellular cores are known for their exceptional energy absorption properties, which make them effective energy absorbers for high-impact scenarios such as accidents or explosions. For advancing research on sandwich panels, it is vital to develop innovative designs that can enhance their energy absorption and flexural stiffness. This review outlines the most essential topological parameters that influence the mechanical properties of cellular core structures. This paper gives insight into recent advancements related to optimizing sandwich panel structures for various engineering applications. The topological parameters investigated by researchers include core structure, thickness, number of layers, and material. The choice of core material governs the overall mechanical behavior of the panel. In this paper, various structures, including foam, honeycomb, lattice, corrugated, bioinspired, and various materials, are compared. Functionally graded structures were also explored in the literature as they can significantly optimize the response of sandwich panels in high and low-velocity impact applications. Similarly, a multi-layered core structure can enhance the total stiffness and specific energy absorption of the panel. © 2023 The Author(s).

The crushing behaviors and energy absorption performance of the PSC multilayer thin-walled sandwich structures and the traditional serpentine space-filling curve (SSC) multilayer thin-walled sandwich structures were investigated using quasi-static compression experiments and numerical analysis. Taking the initial peak crushing force (IPF), specific energy absorption (SEA), and crushing force efficiency (CFE) as evaluation criteria, the effects of geometric parameters, including the curve order, layer height, septa thickness, and wall thickness, on energy absorption performance were comprehensively examined. The results indicated that the energy absorption capacity of the PSC structure was significantly enhanced due to its complex hierarchy. Specifically, the second-order PSC structure demonstrated a 53.2% increase in energy absorption compared to the second-order SSC structure, while the third-order PSC structure showed more than a six-fold increase in energy absorption compared to the third-order SSC structure. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization method based on the response surface method and the NSGA-II algorithm were employed to optimize the wall thickness and layer height of the proposed novel PSC structures. The optimal solutions suggested that a reasonable wall thickness and layer height were two important factors for designing PSC structures with better energy absorption performance. The findings of this study provide an effective guide for using the space-filling concept with Peano curves for the design of a novel polymer thin-walled energy absorber with high energy absorption efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.","3D-printed polymer materials; energy absorption; multilayer thin-walled sandwich structures; optimization; Peano space-filling curves","3D printing; Absorption efficiency; Crushing; Curve fitting; Filling; Honeycomb structures; Multilayers; Multiobjective optimization; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Thin walled structures; 3d-printed polymer material; Absorption performance; Multilayer thin-walled sandwich structure; Optimisations; Peano space filling curves; Polymer materials; Space filling; Space-filling curve; Thin-walled; Wall thickness; Energy absorption","Ha, Ngoc-san, A review of recent research on bio-inspired structures and materials for energy absorption applications, Composites Part B: Engineering, 181, (2020); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Zhang, Yong, On functionally graded composite structures for crashworthiness, Composite Structures, 132, pp. 393-405, (2015); Zhang, Zhijia, Design of a novel multi-walled tube-reinforced aluminum foam for energy absorption, Composite Structures, 276, (2021); Dong, Jianhua, Axial crushing behaviors of buckling induced triangular tubular structures, Materials and Design, 201, (2021); Ha, Ngoc-san, Mechanical properties and energy absorption of bio-inspired hierarchical circular honeycomb, Composites Part B: Engineering, 236, (2022); Zhu, Guohua, Energy-absorbing mechanisms and crashworthiness design of CFRP multi-cell structures, Composite Structures, 233, (2020); Nian, Yuze, Energy absorption characteristics of functionally graded polymer-based lattice structures filled aluminum tubes under transverse impact loading, Materials and Design, 209, (2021); Ma, Wen, Mechanical performance of bio-inspired corrugated tubes with varying vertex configurations, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 172, (2020); Wang, Chunyan, Structure design and multi-objective optimization of a novel crash box based on biomimetic structure, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 138-139, pp. 489-501, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The relationship between the power function exponent (PFE) and normalized power function coefficient (NPFC) of honeycomb structure and its equivalent Poisson’s ratio (EPR) was explored to identify the range of variables required for the negative Poisson’s ratio effect. To investigate the in-plane mechanical properties and energy absorption characteristics of NHPC, the deformation mode, dynamic response, and energy absorption characteristics under various impact velocities were studied by constructing an in-plane impact simulation model. The results showed that NHPC obviously exhibited a negative Poisson’s ratio effect on medium and low impact velocities, and the deformation was primarily uniform. As the NPFC increased, the honeycomb structure was less prone to stress concentration, while the peak crushing force (PCF) and the specific energy absorption (SEA) declined and the plateau stress increased. A multi-objective optimization experiment was operated with low PCF and high SEA as the targets within the range of design variables in order to generate the optimal NHPC. According to the experimental findings, the improved NHPC showed a 25.48 % reduction in PCF and a 19.29 % increase in SEA.

First, a single-cell structure is proposed via a bionic honeycomb, and then the single-cell structure is arrayed to form a spatial lattice structure. The finite element model of the spatial lattice structure for crashworthiness analysis is established. The theoretical model of the plateau stress of the lattice structure under compressive conditions is derived, and its accuracy is verified by the corresponding finite element analysis. After that, the effect of geometrical parameters of single-cell structure on crashworthiness is analyzed. Then, geometrical parameters of single-cell structure and number of single-cell in the X, Y, and Z directions are used as design variables, the mass, and overall size are used as constraints, and specific energy absorption and collision peak force are used as optimization objectives.

However, issues such as inconsistent fiber orientation distribution and void formation during the layer stacking process have hindered the further optimization of the composite material’s performance. This study aimed to address these challenges by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the influence of carbon fiber content and printing parameters on the micro-morphology, thermal properties, and mechanical properties of PA6-CF composites. Additionally, a heat treatment process was proposed to enhance the interlayer bonding and tensile properties of the printed composites in the printing direction. The experimental results demonstrate that the PA6-CF25 composite achieved the highest tensile strength of 163 MPa under optimal heat treatment conditions: 120 °C for 7.5 h. This corresponds to a significant tensile strength enhancement of 406% compared to the unreinforced composites, which represents the highest reported improvement in the current field of CFRP-fused deposition 3D printing. Additionally, we have innovatively developed a single-layer monofilament CF-OD model to quantitatively analyze the influence of fiber orientation distribution on the properties of the composite material. Under specific heat treatment conditions, the sample exhibits an average orientation angle μ of 0.43 and an orientation angle variance of 8.02. The peak frequency of fiber orientation closely aligns with 0°, which corresponds to the printing direction. Finally, the study explored the lightweight applications of the composite material, showcasing the impressive specific energy absorption (SEA) value of 17,800 J/kg when implementing 3D-printed PA6-CF composites as fillers in automobile crash boxes. © 2023 by the authors.","crash box; fiber reinforced composites; fused deposition 3D printing; heat treatment process; honeycomb structure; orientation distribution; polyamide","3D modeling; 3D printing; Accidents; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Heat treatment; Honeycomb structures; Specific heat; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Composites material; Crash box; Fiber orientation distribution; Fibre-reinforced composite; Fused deposition 3d printing; Heat-treatment process; Orientation distributions; Deposition","Markandan, Kalaimani, Fabrication, properties and applications of polymer composites additively manufactured with filler alignment control: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 256, (2023); Huang, Yiming, Progressive concurrent topological optimization with variable fiber orientation and content for 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced polymer composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 255, (2023); Rosén, Tomas, Elucidating the Opportunities and Challenges for Nanocellulose Spinning, Advanced Materials, 33, 28, (2021); Unterweger, Christoph, Characterization of carbon fiber surfaces and their impact on the mechanical properties of short carbon fiber reinforced polypropylene composites, Composites Science and Technology, 108, pp. 41-47, (2015); Love, Lonnie J., The importance of carbon fiber to polymer additive manufacturing, Journal of Materials Research, 29, 17, pp. 1893-1898, (2014); Zhang, Wei, Interfacial bonding strength of short carbon fiber/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene composites fabricated by fused deposition modeling, Composites Part B: Engineering, 137, pp. 51-59, (2018); Wong, Janet, Additive manufacturing of fiber-reinforced polymer composites: A technical review and status of design methodologies, Composites Part B: Engineering, 255, (2023); Khan, Zahid Iqbal, Synthesis and characterization of composite materials with enhanced thermo-mechanical properties for unmanned aerial vehicles (Uavs) and aerospace technologies, Pertanika Journal of Science and Technology, 29, 3, pp. 2003-2015, (2021); Rana, Sohel K., Processing and performance of carbon/epoxy multi-scale composites containing carbon nanofibres and single walled carbon nanotubes, Journal of Polymer Research, 20, 12, (2013); Li, Xiping, High strength carbon-fiber reinforced polyamide 6 composites additively manufactured by screw-based extrusion, Composites Science and Technology, 229, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

When it comes to printing time, we can decrease the printing time by altering the infill, which also reduces the total process extent. Choosing the right filling parameters affects the strength of the printed model. In this research, the effect of filling density and infill pattern on the fatigue lifetime of cylindrical polylactic acid (PLA) samples was investigated with finite element modeling and analysis. This causes the lattice structure to be considered macro-scale porosity in the additive manufacturing process. Due to the need for multi-objective optimization of several functions at the same time and the inevitable sacrifice of other objectives, the decision was to obtain a set of compromise solutions according to the Pareto-optimal solution technique or the Pareto non-inferior solution approach. As a result, a horizontally printed rectangular pattern with 60% filling was preferred over the four patterns including honeycomb, triangular, regular octagon, and irregular octagon by considering the sum of mass changes and fatigue lifetime changes, and distance from the optimal point, which is the lightest structure with the maximum fatigue lifetime as an objective function with an emphasis on mass as an important parameter in designing scaffolds and biomedical structures. A new structure was also proposed by performing a structural optimization process using computer-aided design tools and also, computer-aided engineering software by Dassault systems. Finally, the selected samples were printed and their 3D printing quality was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy inspection. ©: © 2023 Dadashi, Azadi.

The main objective of this study was to provide some ideas for the optimization of the ISSH structure in ships. As a result, 2D-ISSH specimens were fabricated using 3D printing technology, and a quasistatic compression test was carried out to investigate the deformation mode and mechanical properties. The experimental results showed that the 2D-ISSH structure exhibited “V”-shaped and “-”-shaped deformation patterns with a double-platform stress stage. To further utilize the excellent performance of the structure and obtain a better negative Poisson’s ratio effect and broader application, based on the properties of the 2D-ISSH specimen, a 3D-ISSH structure was proposed and a finite element simulation was carried out. The simulation results of the 3D-ISSH structure showed different deformation patterns, including “X”- shaped and “-”-shaped patterns. According to the deformation mechanism of typical cells, the stress formula for the 3D-ISSH double platform was derived, and the theoretical results agreed well with the numerical results.

They have high energy absorption and low reaction forces, preventing damage to boats and berthing structures. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel conceptual design for a new class of lightweight boat-fendering systems with superior energy absorption/dissipation and shape recovery features. Different metamaterials with honeycomb, re-entrant, and re-entrant chiral auxetic patterns are designed in the form of boat fender panels, and their thermo-mechanical behaviors are analyzed experimentally and numerically. A finite element modeling (FEM) is developed to investigate the compressive behaviors of boat fenders. Some of designs are 4D printed by fused filament fabrication of shape memory polylactic acid polymers and then tested thermo-mechanically. A good correlation is observed between numerical and experimental results, supporting the FEM accuracy. Results reveal that proposed boat fenders have considerable energy absorption/dissipation along with the capability to fully recover plastic deformations by simply heating up. The excellent mechanical property recovery of the proposed boat-fendering system is also shown under cycling loadings. Due to the absence of similar conceptual designs, models, and results in the specialized literature, this paper is expected to be instrumental towards 4D printing novel boat fenders with supreme energy absorption/dissipation and shape recovery properties promoting sustainability. © 2023 The Author(s).

Additively manufactured TPE honeycombs were designed in this study to include these buckling initiators, which introduced a slight decrease in initial weight, as well as initial stress concentrations, while improving crashworthiness characteristics. The samples with buckling initiators (1BI) showed an increase in crush efficiency when directly compared to their no buckling initiator (0BI) counterparts. The 1BI samples maintained an increased crush efficiency regardless of the strain rate used. The samples with 1BI were able to better equilibrate the peak stress with the plateau stress. These honeycomb samples were found to maintain their crush efficiency, even after multiple rounds of compression testing. The quasi-static 0BI samples experienced a 23.4% decrease in the peak stress after multiple rounds of compression testing, while the 1BI samples saw approximately a 23.0% decrease. The 1BI samples averaged a decrease in crush efficiency of 0.5%, while the 0BI samples saw a decrease in crush efficiency of 5%. As the strain rate increased, the crush efficiency for the 1BI samples showed an increase in performance, with a smaller degradation in crush efficiency over multiple uses. Visco-elastic honeycomb with buckling initiators has a higher energy absorption than samples with no buckling initiators when exposed to multiple impact cycles. © 2023 by the authors.","crashworthiness; energy absorption; honeycomb; out of plane compression","Compression testing; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Shape optimization; Strain rate; Absorption recovery; Energy; Energy-absorbing materials; Honeycomb; Out-of-plane compression; Peak stress; Recovery performance; Shape recovery; Strain-rates; Visco-elastic; Buckling","Schultz, Jesse, Design of honeycomb mesostructures for crushing energy absorption, Journal of Mechanical Design, 134, 7, (2012); Ivañez, Inés, Compressive deformation and energy-absorption capability of aluminium honeycomb core, Composite Structures, 174, pp. 123-133, (2017); Alkbir, Munir Faraj Almbrouk, Fibre properties and crashworthiness parameters of natural fibre-reinforced composite structure: A literature review, Composite Structures, 148, pp. 59-73, (2016); Int J Res Eng Technol, (2025); Jiang, Hongyong, Design of novel plug-type triggers for composite square tubes: enhancement of energy-absorption capacity and inducing failure mechanisms, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 131-132, pp. 113-136, (2017); Ren, Yiru, Evaluation of double- and triple-coupled triggering mechanisms to improve crashworthiness of composite tubes, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 157-158, pp. 1-12, (2019); Lau, Saijod T.W., On the effect of geometrical designs and failure modes in composite axial crushing: A literature review, Composite Structures, 94, 3, pp. 803-812, (2012); Cricrì, Gabriele, Honeycomb failure processes under in-plane loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 45, 1, pp. 1079-1090, (2013); Zhang, Xiaowei, Axial crushing of circular tubes with buckling initiators, Thin-Walled Structures, 47, 6-7, pp. 788-797, (2009); Zhang, Xiaowei, Energy absorption of an axially crushed square tube with a buckling initiator, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 3, pp. 402-417, (2009)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The structure consists of an anti-creep, a thin-walled structure with nonuniform thickness, diaphragms, two types of aluminum honeycombs and a guide rail. The finite element model of SCEA structure was established and validated by full-scale experimental test. Taking the thicknesses of thin walls (T <inf>A</inf> and T <inf>B</inf>) and diaphragms (T <inf>gb</inf>), strengths of honeycombs (δ <inf>A</inf> and δ <inf>B</inf>) as parametric variables, the parameters of SCEA structure were changed based on a virtual design of experiments (DOE) to generate training data and test data. To improve the crashworthiness of SCEA structure, the structural parameters were employed as input data, four machine learning models were utilized to predict the energy-absorbing characteristic curve of the SCEA structure, and the prediction accuracy of different models was compared and analyzed. According to the results of comparison, the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) model was chosen to predict the structural energy-absorbing characteristics, also employed as the input of optimization. The energy absorption (EA) and initial peak crushing force (PCF) were adopted as objectives, and the global response surface method (GRSM) was employed as the optimization algorithm. The results showed that the optimal solution was obtained as PCF = 618.41 kN and EA = 297.99 kJ when T <inf>A</inf> = 2.1 mm, T <inf>B</inf> = 2.9 mm, T <inf>gb</inf> = 2.4 mm, δ <inf>A</inf> = 5.99 MPa and δ <inf>B</inf> = 4.82 MPa.

They cannot reuse due to plastic buckling after a deformation. To overcome this disadvantage, many researchers have actively studied the development of a reusable honeycomb structure using the elastic buckling mechanism. They proposed a new shape for honeycombs: one that can absorb and dissipate energy through a negative stiffness (NS) effect caused by the elastic buckling phenomenon. However, existing studies have focused on the concept design of the NS curved beam, and the research on how to design products in detail is insufficient. Therefore, this study proposes a digital twin data-driven design framework for the detailed design of the semi-symmetric NS curved beam. For this, multi-disciplinary and multi-objective optimization of the virtual NS beam model is performed by maximizing the energy absorption in the elastic buckling discipline through geometric design variables and analytical parameters, and enhancing its similarity to accurate theoretical models in the digital twin discipline through coupling variables. For the optimization, the specific energy absorption (SEA) and error rate are modeled as regression models, and convergence is modeled as a classification model using an artificial intelligence (AI) model. The optimum results improved the energy absorption and reduced the relative error rates while ensuring convergence of the virtual model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Data-driven design; Digital twin; Energy absorption; Multi-objective optimization (MOO); Multidisciplinary optimization (MDO); Negative stiffness honeycomb","Buckling; Curved beams and girders; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Product design; Regression analysis; Stiffness; Structural design; Curved beams; Data driven; Data-driven design; Elastic buckling; Multi-disciplinary optimizations; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Multidisciplinary optimization; Negative stiffness; Negative stiffness honeycomb; Multiobjective optimization","Correa, Dixon M., Negative stiffness honeycombs for recoverable shock isolation, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 21, 2, pp. 193-200, (2015); Correa, Dixon M., Mechanical design of negative stiffness honeycomb materials, Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation, 4, 1, pp. 165-175, (2015); Qiu, Jin, A curved-beam bistable mechanism, Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, 13, 2, pp. 137-146, (2004); Ngo, Tienhoang, An Energy Harvester Based on a Bistable Origami Mechanism, International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing, 23, 2, pp. 213-226, (2022); Klatt, Timothy D., Selective laser sintering of negative stiffness mesostructures for recoverable, nearly-ideal shock isolation, pp. 1010-1022, (2013); Shan, Sicong, Multistable Architected Materials for Trapping Elastic Strain Energy, Advanced Materials, 27, 29, pp. 4296-4301, (2015); Correa, Dixon M., Negative stiffness honeycombs for recoverable shock isolation, pp. 702-713, (2014); Chen, Shuai, A novel gradient negative stiffness honeycomb for recoverable energy absorption, Composites Part B: Engineering, 215, (2021); Tan, Xiaojun, Effect of beam configuration on its multistable and negative stiffness properties, Composite Structures, 286, (2022); Chen, Qi, Design of buckling-induced mechanical metamaterials for energy absorption using topology optimization, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 58, 4, pp. 1395-1410, (2018)",""

In this paper, we studied the impact resistance of two types of broadly used honeycomb structures (HCSs), a hexagonal HCS and an auxetic HCS. We developed a neural network (NN) which could effectively help to find an optimal gradient design for energy absorption of HCSs in contrast with their uniform counterpart. The optimal density gradient for both hexagonal HCS and auxetic HCS was identified, which are 66% and 40% higher in energy absorption than their respective uniform control. Followed finite-element analysis revealed that density gradient of HCSs enables loading transfer among a greater deformation zone, consequentially more cells involving in energy absorption. The initially graded sample promotes a de-gradient process and leads to more homogeneous density; conversely, a uniform sample develops localized deformation when subject to impact loading. Such an equal-load-partition (ELP) strategy in graded HCSs is responsible for their supreme energy absorption. The developed machine learning (ML) method for impact resistance optimization and the revealed deformation mechanisms in graded HCSs would be meaningful for the design of new advanced graded materials. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorption; Equal-load-partition; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Machine learning","Honeycomb structures; Machine learning; Auxetics; Density gradients; Equal-load-partition; Graded honeycomb; Gradient structure; Hexagonal honeycomb; High impact resistance; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Performance; Energy absorption","Liu, Z.

A study is conducted to explore the interaction between hierarchical geometries and determine the optimum honeycomb configuration that improves crashworthiness. Nine distinct second-order vertex-based hierarchical honeycombs are constructed by iteratively replacing the vertices of a square-based honeycomb with squares, circles, and octagons. Validated finite element models are then established to investigate the out-of-plane crashworthiness performance. Subsequently, the effect of the hierarchical geometry combinations and cell length ratios on the crashworthiness performance of the nine honeycombs is studied. The study showed that the second-order hierarchical honeycomb exhibited superior crashworthiness performance under the same relative density compared to the regular and first-order hierarchical square honeycombs. The study determined that the circle is a suitable matching geometry in the first- and second-order hierarchies for improving the crashworthiness of a square-based honeycomb.

However, the existing material interpolation models do not make the topology structure have good clarity and stability. In the present study, a novel variable-density topology optimization based on an improved interpolation model is developed for the design of a quasi-honeycomb core. The combined cells are circularly spreading outward from the geometric center of the design domain, and the wall thickness function of the equivalent cell (i.e. a simplified model of the combined cell) is established on the basis of relative density. The SR material interpolation model is modified by adding the minimum elastic modulus term, fitting the weighting and penalty factors, and adopting the volume constraint of Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO). The optimization is conducted to minimize the compliance of the quasi-honeycomb core, in which the relative densities of equivalent cells are chosen as the design variables due to the mapping between topology elements and equivalent cells. The three-dimensional (3D) geometric models of original and optimized quasi-honeycomb cores, upper face sheets, and lower face sheets are built using SolidWorks and printed on a 3D printer. The deflection, strain, bending stiffness, and energy absorption under different material retention rates, restraint positions, and face sheet thicknesses are investigated by three-point bending tests.

This paper attempts to improve the crashworthiness behaviour of a honeycomb crash box by filling the cells with open-cell aluminium foams. Experimental tests were conducted to develop the honeycomb and aluminium foam material model and, also, to validate the finite element model by experimental data. The finite element model was developed in ABAQUS, and different variables were parameterised to aim a quick implementation. The empty aluminium honeycomb crash box is used as a term of comparison with the foam-filled ones. Foam-filling the crash box allows the control of the densification zone for different impact energies using open-cell aluminium foam, which shows the main novelty of this research.

The current study presents an investigation of a novel crash box, which consists of Al shell and 3D-printed lattice core. In view of obtaining a good lightweight and energy absorption, the lattice structures are fabricated by fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology using carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6 (PA6/CF) composites. First, the correlations between fiber content and elastic modulus, maximum tensile stress are established by a least squares method. Four different lattice structures including hexagonal, kagome, re-entrant and triangular honeycombs are additive-manufactured. The results reveal that the experimental data from compression test is in good agreement with the simulation analysis, and the kagome achieves the maximum specific energy absorption (SEA) values through numerical analysis. Then, an integrated “material-structure” model is constructed in an Isight environment to analyze the sensitivity of the material property (elastic modulus (E), tensile strength (σ) and fracture strain (ε)) and geometric parameters (thickness (t) and unit size (r) on the crashworthiness performance. A multi-objective optimization strategy with maximum SEA and minimum mass as objectives for the novel crash box is established using response surface model approach and optimal Latin hypercube. Simulation results show that the crash box optimized by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) algorithm can improve the energy absorption with mass reduction, which provides some reference for the structural design and optimization of the crash box. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Crash box; Crashworthiness; Lattice structures; Mechanical properties; Multi-objective optimization","3D printing; Accidents; Compression testing; Crashworthiness; Ductile fracture; Elastic moduli; Energy absorption; Genetic algorithms; Least squares approximations; Shape optimization; Structural design; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Absorbing components; Crash box; Crashworthiness optimization; Energy; Lattice structures; Multi-objectives optimization; Passive safety; Specific energy absorption; Multiobjective optimization","Yuan, Lin, Quasi-static impact of origami crash boxes with various profiles, Thin-Walled Structures, 141, pp. 435-446, (2019); Hu, Dayong, Energy-absorption characteristics of a bionic honeycomb tubular nested structure inspired by bamboo under axial crushing, Composites Part B: Engineering, 162, pp. 21-32, (2019); Chung Kim Yuen, S.

In this research, the deformation behavior, microscopic failure modes and energy absorption characteristics of re-entrant hexagonal structure, regular hexagonal structure and regular quadrilateral structure are studied under different strain rates impact. The re-entrant hexagonal structure forms a “X”-shaped deformation zone, the regular quadrilateral and regular hexagonal structure form an “I”-shaped deformation zone. The microscopic appearance of the section is a mixed fracture form. The effects of the topological shape, cell angle, and cell height on the impact behavior of the structure were evaluated. When the cell height is fixed and the cell angle is changed, the energy absorption of the structure increase and then decrease as the relative density increase. The mechanical properties of the structure are optimal when the relative density is about 18.6% and the cell angle is 22.5°. When the cell angle is fixed and the cell height is changed, as the relative density increases, the energy absorption of the structure gradually increases. The regular quadrilateral structure and the re-entrant hexagonal structure experienced clear strain rate effects under dynamic impact conditions; the regular hexagonal structure did not exhibit obvious strain rate effects.

The relative density of the bionic core is firstly defined, which is closely related to cell configuration and geometric parameters. Through finite element simulations supported by experiments using 3D printed specimens, the novel bionic core is found to be superior in crashworthiness as compared to conventional honeycomb core in terms of specific energy absorption and mean force under out-of-plane compression. To decipher the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced performances, a theoretical model for the bionic core is derived based on the simplified super folding element (SSFE) theory. The effects of wall thickness, number of cells and amplitude of sinusoidal beam on relative density and crashworthiness are explored. It is revealed that the increase in wall thickness and number of cells led to improvements of load bearing capacity. An optimal structure is subsequently obtained based on the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) and response surface method (RSM). Compared to conventional honeycomb core, the optimal peak force of the bionic core is decreased by 11.53%.

Parameter analysis and response surface optimization work based on orthogonal experiments are carried out for UABP, the results are that the wall thickness T and the triangle-width ratio λ2 have extremely significant influences on the SEA, and the order of influence is T>λ2; the wall thickness T and the arc-width ratio λ1 have extremely influences on PF, and the triangle-width ratio λ2 has a significant influence on PF, and the order of influence is T>λ1>λ2. Both the errors about SEA and PF of the optimal solutions are less than 5%. The comprehensive evaluation index of the optimal UABP is larger than that of sandwich panels by 29.15%, 52.61%, 65.64%, 40.5%.

In this paper, the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of honeycomb under axial load are theoretically deduced, and a method is proposed to evaluate the deformation stability of honeycomb with the maximum deviation of unilateral horizontal strain (MDUHS). Numerical simulation is employed to verify the theoretical solution, and the in-plane mechanical properties and deformation behavior of CSSH are investigated in detail. The numerical simulation method in Abaqus software was verified by using quasi-static crush test data of 3D printed CSSH specimens. It is found that by changing the inclined angle θ<inf>2</inf>, CSSH can evolve into a positive Poisson's ratio(PPR), zero Poisson's ratio(ZPR), or negative Poisson's ratio structure(NPR), and Young's modulus is very sensitive to the difference between the opened angle θ<inf>1</inf> and the inclined angle θ<inf>2</inf>; increasing θ<inf>1</inf> or decreasing θ<inf>2</inf> not only significantly improves the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb but also facilitates the generation of a more pronounced double plateau region on the stress-strain curve; by changing the length of the crossed inclined wall, three improved CSSHs(ICSSH) can be obtained. Among them, by adjusting the length of the crossed inclined wall in the horizontal direction, the structure with the superior energy absorption capacity can be obtained. The structure with excellent deformation stability can be obtained through adjusting the length of the crossed inclined wall in the vertical direction. Results show that the performance of CSSH is better than that of SSH, with a specific energy absorption (SEA) of 245% higher than that of SSH.

This relatively new energy source is much more efficient and cleaner than conventional fossil fuel. However, lithium-ion batteries have a high risk of fire during a crash, where the large deformation on the battery during the crash may cause thermal runaway. This research explores that idea by studying the design and optimization of sandwich-based auxetic honeycomb structures to protect the pouch battery cells for the battery pack system of electric vehicles undergoing axial impact load using machine learning methods. The optimization was done using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Type II (NSGA-II) combined with Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

In this study, a sandwich protection system against close-range blast loads containing graded re-entrant circular (REC) auxetic core was proposed, and its blast-resistance performance was investigated based on the numerical methods validated by the field blast test results in the literature. Numerical results showed that compared with the conventional re-entrant (RE) core with the same mass, the REC core can reduce the maximum displacement (MaxD) of the back panel by 2.2% and increase the energy absorption (EA) of the system by 5.7%. If the two cores share the same cell wall thickness, the REC core can reduce MaxD by 28.0% and increase EA by 2.1%. In addition, the effects of geometric parameters, thickness parameters and gradient parameters on the blast-resistance of REC cored protection system were examined. The results indicated that reducing the thickness of the cell wall, that is, reducing the core density, can effectively improve the blast-resistance performance. Finally, to further improve the performance of the proposed explosion protection system, multi-objective optimizations were carried out for the system with uniform and graded REC cores. The results showed that compared with the baseline model, the MaxD of the optimized uniform and graded core sandwich panels is reduced by 20.0% and 33.0%, while the areal specific energy absorption (ASEA) is increased by 21.2% and 23.1%, respectively.

To accomplish this, it is vital to make use of tools which enable the evaluation and potential optimization of the effectiveness of new designs. By concentrating on the computational (CFD) analysis of a direct absorption polymer (polycarbonate) flat plate solar collector's performance, this paper illustrates such an endeavor. The adoption of the suggested material may lead to the manufacture of flat plate collectors that are both more economical and environmentally friendly. The most important aspect in the performance of this collector focuses on the efficient solar energy absorption by the working fluid. This energy transfer is accomplished by employing a clear polymer honeycomb structure inside the collector. Inside the polymer honeycomb structure channels, solar energy is absorbed directly by the working fluid. For the maximization of energy efficiency, it is important to assess and optimize the flow field development and heat transfer inside the collector. For this reason, a CFD model of the solar collector was created in the commercial CFD software Ansys CFX. The model included all the basic geometrical and thermophysical characteristics defining the fluid flow and heat transfer taking place in the solar collector, also taking into consideration buoyancy and gravity effects. For the proper inclusion of the effect of the internal polymer honeycomb structure in the CFD model, a porous medium approach was adopted, and appropriate source terms were added in the Navier-stokes equations through which the macroscopic effect on the fluid flow development and heat transfer could be sufficiently captured. CFD computations were performed to investigate the temperature, velocity, and pressure patterns in different regions of the solar collector, and a broader insight regarding the flow field and heat transfer inside the solar collector design was achieved. The CFD results were also compared with reasonable agreement with available experimental and simulation data from the literature. The numerical results showed an acceptable performance of this polymer design in relation to more standard designs. The results also revealed some weak points of the design, such as the identification of recirculation regions which can be the target of future optimization actions in future works. © 2023, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.","","","Mintsa do Ango, A.

To this end, this paper proposes a honeycomb-filled gradient energy-absorbing structure (HGES) as an energy absorber. The crashworthiness of HGES under axial crushing was investigated by means of finite element (FE) simulations and quasi-static loading tests. After performing parametric analyses on HGES, it was discovered that the wall thickness and the platform intensity of honeycomb had an evident impact, whereas the diaphragm thickness had a relatively little impact on the crashworthiness of HGES. The HGES is then given a multi-objective optimization to further enhance its crashworthiness. The wall thickness, the platform intensity of honeycomb and diaphragm thickness were utilized as the design parameters, while minimal peak crushing force (PCF) and maximal specific energy absorption (SEA) were set as optimization objectives. Finally, a methodology integrating entropy and the order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to find the optimal HGES configuration.

However, the gap between peak and mean stresses remains to be narrowed, and effect of interaction between the cells should be enhanced. To break these limits, novel three-dimensional curved-walled mixed-phase honeycombs are proposed in this paper. The specimens manufactured by three-dimensional printing method using 316L stainless steel are used to conduct out-of-plane crushing experiments, and finite element method simulations are carried out by ABAQUS/Explicit. According to experimental and simulation results, theoretical model is established based on the Simplified Super Folding Element theory to estimate the out-of-plane effective mean stress. From the results, the proposed honeycombs display efficient progressive folding mode and desirable mechanical properties, and the gap between peak and mean stresses is effectively narrowed.

However, it is susceptible to localized low-velocity impacts such as tool drop during maintenance, and thus, understanding the damage behavior is important for a safety design and optimization. The objective of this article is to investigate the influence of the structural parameters and impact energy on the damage behaviors of the composite honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to localized low-velocity impact. An effective computational framework considering complicate damage mechanisms is proposed to predict the failure patterns, load history, and energy absorption. Comparisons with the experimental data show that the error of predictions is within 4% and thus the framework is validated. Then, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of wall thickness and height of honeycomb, impact energy, and stacking sequences of the laminated facesheets on the impact resistance, damage behaviors, and energy absorption of the sandwich structure.

This article aimed at investigating blast response of hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structure having perforations along the cell height of core over conventional honeycomb cores. The study discussed the mechanics of deformation behavior of perforated sandwich structure to improve the energy absorption characteristics of the bare honeycomb core sandwich structure. Detailed numerical analysis is conducted to accurately produce the deformation process with finite element analysis using explicit software LS-DYNA®. Blast load resulting from 1 kg TNT on the sandwich structure is applied using Conventional Weapons Effects Program (ConWep) function available in LS-DYNA. Several different parameters consisting of varying sizes of perforation by changing d/l ratio, shape, number of perforations and different facesheet and backsheet thicknesses, and different scaled distances are investigated in detail. The results indicated that both size and shape and number of perforations have significant influence on reduction of blast impulse. The variation of facesheet and backsheet thicknesses without changing the overall thickness of the structure also has evident effect in blast resistance capability of perforated honeycomb sandwich structure. The blast mitigation and energy absorption capacity of honeycomb core sandwich structure can be improved with the provision of perforations and optimizing the arrangement of holes. The perforated honeycomb core is further investigated based on analytical formulation developed using single degree of freedom (SDOF) system analysis approach. Optimization study is done further to get the best configuration based on different design variable limits. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Blast; ConWep; honeycomb; perforation; sandwich; TNT","Blast resistance; Deformation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic loads; Energy absorption; Sandwich structures; Blast; Blast loads; Conventional weapon effect program; Conventional weapons; Face sheets; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Perforation; Sandwich; TNT; Honeycomb structures","Goel, Manmohan Dass, Blast: Characteristics, loading and computation-an overview, pp. 417-434, (2015); Goel, Manmohan Dass, Blast-resistant design of structures, Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction, 19, 2, (2014); Shirbhate, Payal A., A Critical Review of Blast Wave Parameters and Approaches for Blast Load Mitigation, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 28, 3, pp. 1713-1730, (2021); 8th International Ls Dyna Users Conference, (2004); Sriram, Rajan, Blast impact response of aluminum foam sandwich composites, Journal of Materials Science, 41, 13, pp. 4023-4039, (2006); Langdon, Genevieve S., The response of honeycomb core sandwich panels, with aluminum and composite face sheets, to blast loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 12, 6, pp. 733-754, (2010); Composite Sandwich Structures with Honeycomb Core Subjected to Impact, (2012); Radford, Darren D., The response of clamped sandwich plates with metallic foam cores to simulated blast loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 43, 7-8, pp. 2243-2259, (2006); Langdon, Genevieve S., The air-blast response of sandwich panels with composite face sheets and polymer foam cores: Experiments and predictions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 54, pp. 64-82, (2013); Wang, Tao, Mechanical response of square honeycomb sandwich plate with asymmetric face sheet subjected to blast loading, Procedia Engineering, 23, pp. 457-463, (2011)",""

To this end, a new type of honeycomb-filled thin-walled energy absorber with axisymmetric thickness (HTEA-AT) was proposed. Unlike the honeycomb-filled thin-walled energy absorber with uniform thickness (HTEA-UT), the thicknesses of adjacent tube walls of HTEA-AT were defined as independent variables, while the thicknesses of the opposite walls remained identical. Numerical, theoretical and experimental methods were adopted to systematically investigate the crushing mechanics of the honeycomb-filled thin-walled energy absorber (HTEA). To improve the crashworthiness of HTEA-AT and HTEA-UT, a multi-objective optimization design (MOD) was carried out. The results revealed that HTEA-AT has a lower peak force and higher energy absorption than HTEA-UT, achieving superior crashworthiness performance. In addition, a multi-criteria decision-making method combining integrated entropy and gray relational analysis (GRA) was introduced to seek the ideal balance between the energy absorption (EA) and initial peak crushing force (IPCF) in the Pareto front. The optimized results indicated that the gray correlation was the largest at optimal point C, where EA and IPCF reached a balance (EA = 177.82 kJ, IPCF = 430.03 kN). This means that the optimized configuration can provide insightful information for the crashworthiness design of the energy-absorbing structure at the end of subways. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","axisymmetric thickness; crashworthiness; Honeycomb-filled thin-walled energy absorber; multi-criteria decision-making method; optimization","Crushing; Decision making; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical methods; Subways; Thin walled structures; Axisymmetric; Axisymmetric thickness; Energy absorbers; Energy absorbing structure; Honeycomb-filled thin-walled energy absorber; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision making methods; Optimisations; Performance; Thin-walled; Crashworthiness","Ma, Wen, Mechanical performance of bio-inspired corrugated tubes with varying vertex configurations, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 172, (2020); Guan, Weiyuan, Crashworthiness analysis and multi-objective optimization of expanding circular tube energy absorbers with cylindrical anti-clamber under eccentric loading for subway vehicles, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 61, 4, pp. 1711-1729, (2020); Ebrahimi, Saeed, Multiobjective optimization and sensitivity analysis of honeycomb sandwich cylindrical columns under axial crushing loads, Thin-Walled Structures, 88, pp. 90-104, (2015); Zhang, Zonghua, Comparisons of honeycomb sandwich and foam-filled cylindrical columns under axial crushing loads, Thin-Walled Structures, 49, 9, pp. 1071-1079, (2011); Santosa, Sigit Puji, Crash behavior of box columns filled with aluminum honeycomb or foam, Computers and Structures, 68, 4, pp. 343-367, (1998); Zhou, Hui, Composite energy-absorbing structures combining thin-walled metal and honeycomb structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 231, 4, pp. 394-405, (2017); Paz Méndez, Javier, Crushing analysis and multi-objective crashworthiness optimization of GFRP honeycomb-filled energy absorption devices, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 91, pp. 30-39, (2014); Wang, Zhonggang, Matching effect of honeycomb-filled thin-walled square tube—Experiment and simulation, Composite Structures, 157, pp. 494-505, (2016); Peng, Yong, Crashing analysis and multi-objective optimisation of duplex energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicle, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 21, 4, pp. 338-352, (2016); Xie, Suchao, Design and analysis of a composite energy-absorbing structure for use on railway vehicles, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 230, 3, pp. 825-839, (2016)",""

Therefore, a new negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure named three-beam star honeycomb (TBSH) is proposed based on the classical star honeycomb (CSH). The stress equation of TBSH is derived by energy method, and its deformation characteristics and mechanical properties are studied. The results show that the structural deformation modes are different under different impact velocities, and TBSH has more obvious NPR effect. In addition, the influence of geometrical parameters on energy absorption of structures is also investigated. Finally, the thickness gradient is introduced into this structure, and the thickness gradient is optimized by multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA). After optimization, the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the structure is significantly improved, while the initial peak stress (IPS) is decreased.

Then, the crashworthiness of honeycomb-filled tubes, foam-filled tubes and empty tube under axial load was systematically compared and analyzed. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the mechanical behavior of filled tubes subjected to bending load was carried out based on the study of dynamic response curve, specific energy absorption and deformation mechanism, the difference in energy absorption performance between them was also revealed.

Based on the experimental data in the existing literatures, the parameters of the H/V-JC/CS constitutive model for metal materials are calibrated by using the global optimization algorithm, which has high accuracy, convenient application, and is unlimited in number of parameters. The obtained parameters do not depend on the initial value and are the global optimal combination.

To take advantage of these desirable properties, a novel composite tube with auxetic honeycomb filler was proposed in this work. The honeycomb filler of the composite tube was manufactured by 3D printing technology. The bending properties of two kinds of tubes were studied, namely aluminum tube with re-entrant honeycomb filler and aluminum tube with hexagonal honeycomb filler, respectively. The mechanical responses, deformational characteristics, and failure mechanism of the composite tube under three-point bending were studied by experimental and numerical methods. The study showed that the experiment and numerical results match well with each other. In addition, parametric analysis was carried out to examine the effects of filler and aluminum alloy tubes on the bending properties of the composite tube.

In this research, the biomimetic honeycomb structure was applied to internal anti-collision pier interior structures. The enhancement of mechanical strength and energy absorption characteristics was explored and optimized by five anti-collision pier honeycomb structures. Finite elements of the piers are designated as 650 mm in diameter and 850 mm in height. Polypropylene Acetate (PLA) material is utilized in this research due to its environment-friendly characteristics. Displacement loading in finite element simulation is 50 mm to the middle region of the model at YOZ direction. The energy-absorbing properties of five optimized honeycomb anti-collision piers at the same force position will be carefully compared. Moreover, the influence of internal hexagon direction-quantity configuration upon loading resistance under displacement loading is outlined. The results determined the best biomimetic structure to be three honeycomb shapes with a central triangle area, with maximum stress of 503.8 MPa and fracture displacement of 58.02 mm. Furthermore, the numerical simulation shows that the number of nest increases has a negative relationship with the effect upon force and deformation of the model. Moreover, the triangular central area is superior to the Y-shape central area in both mechanical strength and energy absorption performance. © 2022 by the authors.","bionic structure optimization; cellular structure; numerical calculation; road pier","","Zhang, Chunwei, Investigation on low-cost friction-based isolation systems for masonry building structures: Experimental and numerical studies, Engineering Structures, 243, (2021); Liu, Baodong, Damping dissipation properties of rubberized concrete and its application in anti-collision of bridge piers, Construction and Building Materials, 236, (2020); Huang, Hua, Experimental Investigation on Rehabilitation of Corroded RC Columns with BSP and HPFL under Combined Loadings, Journal of Structural Engineering, 146, 8, (2020); Thomas, Tiju T., Crushing behavior of honeycomb structure: a review, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 24, 5, pp. 555-579, (2019); Wang, Zhonggang, On the influence of structural defects for honeycomb structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 183-192, (2018); Zhang, Wengang, Engineering properties of the Bukit Timah Granitic residual soil in Singapore, Underground Space (new), 4, 2, pp. 98-108, (2019); Zhou, Cong, Torsional behavior of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) rectangular beams without steel reinforcement: Experimental investigation and theoretical analysis, Composite Structures, 299, (2022); Gondwana Research, (2022); Int J Econ Technol Soc Sci, (2021); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Undoubtedly, vertexes with Plateau borders (VPB) play a significant role on the dynamic elastic moduli. This paper proposes an analytical framework of the frequency-dependent equivalent in-plane dynamic elastic moduli (Young's moduli E<inf>1</inf>(ω), E<inf>2</inf>(ω), Poisson's ratio ν<inf>12</inf>(ω), ν<inf>21</inf>(ω) and shear modulus G<inf>12</inf>(ω)) of LSPB. First, dynamic stiffness (DS) matrix of a lattice cell edge (based on rod and Timoshenko theories) connected to VPBs (modelled as rigid bodies) at both ends is formulated. Then, based on the above DS matrix and the unit cell method, closed-form expressions of equivalent in-plane dynamic elastic moduli are proposed, which are sufficient general to be applied to four types of lattices. The effects of mass, inertia moment and size of VPB on the equivalent dynamic elastic moduli are studied, with both physical and mathematical interpretations. Furthermore, the proposed expressions are applied to honeycomb, rectangular, auxetic and rhombus LSPB and some interesting and important observations are made. This research provides analytical expressions for broadband dynamic elastic moduli of LSPB, which can be directly used in the design and optimization of composite structures with lattice cores. © 2022","Broadband dynamic homogenization; Dynamic stiffness method; Equivalent dynamic elastic moduli; Lattice with Plateau borders","Elastic moduli; Homogenization method; Lattice theory; Stiffness matrix; Broadband dynamic homogenization; Dynamic elastic moduli; Dynamic homogenizations; Dynamic stiffness method; Dynamic-stiffness matrix; Energy absorption properties; Equivalent dynamic elastic modulus; Lattice structures; Lattice with plateau border; Plateau borders; Stiffness","Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Song, Jian, Octet-truss cellular materials for improved mechanical properties and specific energy absorption, Materials and Design, 173, (2019); Li, Weiwei, Plastic deformation and energy absorption of polycrystalline-like lattice structures, Materials and Design, 198, (2021); Yungwirth, Christian J., Experiment assessment of the ballistic response of composite pyramidal lattice truss structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 39, 3, pp. 556-569, (2008); Zheng, Jingjing, Energy absorption mechanisms of hierarchical woven lattice composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 43, 3, pp. 1516-1522, (2012); Hu, Jiabao, Temperature dependent mechanical properties of graphene based carbon honeycombs under tension and compression, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 391, (2021); Fabbrocino, Francesco, Three-dimensional modeling of the wave dynamics of tensegrity lattices, Composite Structures, 173, pp. 9-16, (2017); Mancusi, Geminiano, Size effect and dynamic properties of 2D lattice materials, Composites Part B: Engineering, 112, pp. 235-242, (2017); Liu, Xiang, Exact wave propagation analysis of lattice structures based on the dynamic stiffness method and the Wittrick–Williams algorithm, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 174, (2022); Yahaya, Mohd Azman, Response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to foam projectile impact - An experimental study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 100-109, (2015)",""

In addition, honeycombs play a critical role when passive protection is required due to their low density and high energy absorption capabilities. With the transition of additive manufacturing from a rapid prototyping approach to a manufacturing process, this technology has recently offered designers and manufacturers the ability to fabricate and modify lattice structures such as honeycombs. The current study presents the application of laser powder bed fusion, a common additive manufacturing process for producing industrial metal components, for fabricating metal honeycombs. In addition, this study examines three modified designs that can only be practically fabricated using additive manufacturing and compares them with conventional honeycombs. For this purpose, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the honeycomb structures. The results show that the structures produced by additive manufacturing have acceptable performance compared to conventional honeycomb structures, and laser powder bed fusion can be considered to be a reliable manufacturing method for honeycomb production. Furthermore, the honeycombs produced according to the modified designs generally outperformed their counterparts made from the typical hexagonal cells. Ultimately, the use of triangular cells as a design modification is proposed to produce honeycombs with promising performance characteristics in all of their principal axes and under various pressure scenarios, from quasi-static to dynamic loading rates. Finally, this study also investigates the applicability of a newly developed maraging steel for additive manufacturing of honeycombs. Microstructural analysis and quasi-static tensile tests have confirmed the material properties for this purpose. © 2022 The Author(s)","Compression; Digital manufacturing; Honeycomb structures; Impact; Laser powder bed fusion; Strain rate","3D printers; Additives; Compression testing; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Fabrication; Maraging steel; Powder metals; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Compression; Digital manufacturing; Impact; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical design; Mechanical performance; Modified designs; Powder bed; Strain-rates; Honeycomb structures","Moradi, Mahmoud, 3D Printed Parts with Honeycomb Internal Pattern by Fused Deposition Modelling; Experimental Characterization and Production Optimization, Metals and Materials International, 25, 5, pp. 1312-1325, (2019); Kuznetsov, Pavel А., Energy absorbing properties of the cellular structures with different wall thickness, produced by the selective laser melting, Materials Science Forum, 933 MSF, pp. 330-336, (2018); Spratt, M., Build accuracy and compression properties of additively manufactured 304L honeycombs, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 26, 6, pp. 1049-1057, (2020); Kanyilmaz, Alper, Role of metal 3D printing to increase quality and resource-efficiency in the construction sector, Additive Manufacturing, 50, (2022); Ye, Jun, An End-to-End Framework for the Additive Manufacture of Optimized Tubular Structures, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 165476-165489, (2021); Afkhami, S., Effects of notch-load interactions on the mechanical performance of 3D printed tool steel 18Ni300, Additive Manufacturing, 47, (2021); Afkhami, S., Fatigue characteristics of steels manufactured by selective laser melting, International Journal of Fatigue, 122, pp. 72-83, (2019); Xie, Suchao, Crashworthiness optimisation of a composite energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles based on hybrid particle swarm optimisation, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 58, 5, pp. 2291-2308, (2018); Shah, Udit, Failure of alternate honeycomb core sandwich panels, (2019); Antolak-Dudka, Anna, Static and dynamic loading behavior of Ti6Al4V honeycomb structures manufactured by Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENSTM) technology, Materials, 12, 8, (2019)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

In this work, a new concave I-shaped honeycomb structure is established by integrating the re-entrant hexagon and the I-shaped beam structure, and its negative Poisson’s ratio characteristics and energy absorption properties are investigated. The effect of structural parameters on the energy absorption characteristics is analyzed using the finite element model. The results show that both the specific energy absorption and peak impact force decrease with the increase in cellular length and vertical short cellular height, and increase with the increase in horizontal short cellular length and cellular thickness. To obtain a smaller peak impact force and larger specific energy absorption with smaller mass, the four cell sizes were optimized by using Latin hypercube sampling, Gaussian radial basis function, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Compared with the original design, the SEA increased by 44.175%, and the PCF increased by 25.857%. Meanwhile, the mass decreased by 31.140%.

According to these optimization models, three different structures are developed and the best energy-absorbing structure, namely the connected four curved beams honeycomb (CFCBH), is selected. Compared with other common honeycomb structures, the topology optimized structure has better energy absorption characteristics. We further study the mechanical properties of CFCBH, including its platform stress, densification strain and deformation. Finally, a gradient optimization algorithm is proposed, which directly link the optimization objective and design variables through function expression, and the optimization efficiency is greatly improved. After introducing the optimized gradient, the energy absorption capacity of the structure has been improved. The proposed functional gradient optimization algorithm is expected to be widely used. © 2022, Allerton Press, Inc.","energy absorption; functionally graded optimization; honeycomb structure; impact; topology optimization","","Alavi, Ali, Ballistic limit determination of aluminum honeycombs-Experimental study, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 488, 1-2, pp. 273-280, (2008); Yungwirth, Christian J., Impact response of sandwich plates with a pyramidal lattice core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 8, pp. 920-936, (2008); Compton, Brett G., 3D-printing of lightweight cellular composites, Advanced Materials, 26, 34, pp. 5930-5935, (2014); Jiang, Lili, Finite element modeling of multilayer orthogonal auxetic composites under low-velocity impact, Materials, 10, 8, (2017); Duc, Nguyen Dinh, Dynamic response and vibration of composite double curved shallow shells with negative Poisson's ratio in auxetic honeycombs core layer on elastic foundations subjected to blast and damping loads, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 133, pp. 504-512, (2017); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Zhao, Xuan, Crashworthiness analysis and design of composite tapered tubes under multiple load cases, Composite Structures, 222, (2019); Yang, Xianfeng, Out-of-plane crashworthiness analysis of bio-inspired aluminum honeycomb patterned with horseshoe mesostructure, Thin-Walled Structures, 125, pp. 1-11, (2018); He, Qiang, Mechanical properties of spider-web hierarchical honeycombs subjected to out-of-plane impact loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 22, 3, pp. 771-796, (2020); Yang, Xianfeng, In-plane dynamic crushing of a novel circular-celled honeycomb nested with petal-shaped mesostructure, Composite Structures, 226, (2019)",""

However, little is known about the abdominal segments. Mantis shrimps, a group of crustaceans, evolved abdominal segments that are mechanically robust. Here, we conduct a systematic study of the three-dimensional geometry, material composition, nanoindentation mechanical properties, and microstructural features of mantis shrimp abdominal segments. Inspired by the helicoidally distributed fiber hollow tubes of abdominal segment, a mechanically efficient helicoidal structure is designed and fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The LPBF processed helicoidal structure achieves high forming accuracy (peak deviation = 7.5 μm) and relative density (99.78%). Furthermore, using a combination of compression experiments and finite element simulations, we show that the helicoidal structure exhibits superior specific energy absorption (2.4 times) and plateau stress (2.7 times) to the conventional honeycomb structure and tube structure. The structural optimization results show that the rotation angle and the number of layers have a significant effect on the mechanical properties and the helicoidal structure with a rotation angle of 45° and 3 layers has the best comprehensive energy absorption performance. We demonstrate that the mechanism for this improvement in mechanical properties is the unique twisting stress conduction path of the helicoidal structure under compression. Our results reveal that bio-inspired additive manufacturing paves the way to develop high-performance structures which are in great demand in modern industrial applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Bio-inspired; Laser powder bed fusion; Mantis shrimp; Mechanical properties","Additives; Biomimetics; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Bio-inspired; Helicoidal structure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mantis shrimp; Mechanical protection; Mechanically robust; Powder bed; Rotation angles; Surrounding environment; 3D printers","Connors, Matthew J., Bioinspired design of flexible armor based on chiton scales, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Zimmermann, Elizabeth A., Mechanical adaptability of the Bouligand-type structure in natural dermal armour, Nature Communications, 4, (2013); Ha, Ngoc-san, Energy absorption characteristics of bio-inspired hierarchical multi-cell square tubes under axial crushing, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 201, (2021); Gu, Dongdong, Material-structure-performance integrated laser-metal additive manufacturing, Science, 372, 6545, (2021); Yang, Wen, Protective role of Arapaima gigas fish scales: Structure and mechanical behavior, Acta Biomaterialia, 10, 8, pp. 3599-3614, (2014); Lee, Steven S., Impact testing of structural biological materials, Materials Science and Engineering C, 31, 4, pp. 730-739, (2011); Le, Van Tu, A comprehensive review of selected biological armor systems – From structure-function to bio-mimetic techniques, Composite Structures, 225, (2019); Malshe, Ajay P., Bio-inspired textures for functional applications, CIRP Annals, 67, 2, pp. 627-650, (2018); Liang, Hongyu, On design of novel bionic bamboo tubes for multiple compression load cases, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 218, (2022); Yang, Wen, Natural flexible dermal armor, Advanced Materials, 25, 1, pp. 31-48, (2013)",""

A honeycomb cell was first designed by out-of-plane stretching a re-entrant honeycomb and the honeycomb is built by spatially combining the cells. The in-plane response and energy absorption characteristics of the honeycomb are studied through the finite element method (FEM). Some important characteristics are studied and listed as follows: (1) The effects of cell angle and impact velocity on the dynamic response are tested. The results show that the honeycomb exhibits an obvious negative Poisson’s ratio and unique platform stress enhancement effect under the conditions of low and medium velocity. An obvious necking phenomenon appears when the cell angle parameter is 75°. (2) Based on the one-dimensional shock wave theory, the empirical formula of the platform stress is proposed to predict the dynamic bearing capacity of the honeycomb. (3) The energy absorption in different conditions are investigated. Results show that as the impact velocity increases, the energy absorption efficiency gradually decreases. In addition, with the increase of cell angle, the energy absorption efficiency is gradually improved. The above study shows that the honeycomb has good potential in using in vehicle industry as an energy absorption material. It also provides a new strategy for multi-objective optimization of mechanical structure design. © 2022 by the authors.","deformation mode; energy absorption; impact response; negative Poisson’s ratio; platform stress","","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Özen, İsmail, Low-energy impact response of composite sandwich panels with thermoplastic honeycomb and reentrant cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 156, (2020); Hong, Jichao, A novel mechanical-electric-hydraulic power coupling electric vehicle considering different electrohydraulic distribution ratios, Energy Conversion and Management, 249, (2021); Qi, Chang, Multi-scale characterization of novel re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs under quasi-static crushing, Thin-Walled Structures, 169, (2021); Wang, Huan, A novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced in-plane impact resistance, Composite Structures, 208, pp. 758-770, (2019); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: the positive side of being negative, Engineering Science and Education Journal, 9, 4, pp. 148-154, (2000); Hong, Jichao, Thermal Runaway Prognosis of Battery Systems Using the Modified Multiscale Entropy in Real-World Electric Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 7, 4, pp. 2269-2278, (2021); Tan, Hailun, In-plane crashworthiness of re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio, Composite Structures, 229, (2019); Xiao, Dengbao, Compression behavior of the graded metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb: Experiment and finite element analysis, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 758, pp. 163-171, (2019); Djemaoune, Younes A., Numerical investigation into in-plane crushing of tube-reinforced damaged 5052 aerospace grade aluminum alloy honeycomb panels, Materials, 14, 17, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

In order to investigate the dynamic compressive behaviour of STF-filled honeycomb, a comparative study between a STF-filled honeycomb and an empty honeycomb is numerically carried out after the fluid-structure coupled model has been validated against experimental testings. It is shown that the addition of STF in the honeycomb cells results in significant improvement in the energy absorption of the STF-filled honeycomb, which in turn, effectively prevents the premature collapse of the honeycomb cell walls. Furthermore, a parametric study of STF-filled honeycomb is conducted to investigate the contributions of each component to the total energy. It is found that the honeycomb plastic deformation is the predominant mechanism of energy absorption during impact, whilst the proportion of viscous energy contribution to the total energy is significantly reduced when the honeycomb wall thickness is increased. Additionally, the mean crushing force of STF-filled honeycomb has a power law relation to the honeycomb wall thickness for each specific loading velocity. Moreover, the mean crushing force contributed by STF is proportional to loading velocity and the increase in velocity significantly improves the percentage of viscous energy to the total energy. Meanwhile, optimal honeycomb thickness and weight fraction of STF are crucial to avoid earlier plastic densification of the honeycomb during the loading process. The results of this paper provide useful insights for future design and optimization of STF-filled structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fluid-structural interaction; In-plane honeycomb; Mean crushing force; Plastic energy; Shear thickening fluid (STF); Viscous energy","Crushing; Fluid structure interaction; Honeycomb structures; Structural design; Compressive behavior; Fluid structural interactions; Fluid-filled; In-plane honeycomb; Mean crushing force; Plastic energy; Shear thickening fluid; Shear-thickening fluids; Total energy; Viscous energy; Energy absorption","Ju, Jaehyung, Compliant hexagonal periodic lattice structures having both high shear strength and high shear strain, Materials and Design, 32, 2, pp. 512-524, (2011); Stronge, William James, Microdpamics of crushing in cellular solids, Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology, 110, 2, pp. 185-190, (1988); Zhao, Han, Crushing behaviour of aluminium honeycombs under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 10, pp. 827-836, (1998); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Hönig, A., In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycomb.

Research to date on the crashworthiness optimization of energy-absorbing structure has mainly focused on a single collision scenario. However, in train collision accidents, the collision scenarios are diverse and unpredictable, implying that the optimal design under a certain collision scenario may no longer be applicable under other collision scenarios. Additionally, in actual manufacturing, there may be uncertainties in the design parameters. Unfortunately, uncertain structural optimization problems solved with deterministic optimization methods may lead to structural instability or even failure. To this end, this study formulates a multiobjective and multicollision scenario reliability-based design optimization that combines a radial basis function, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), NSGA-II and the order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to seek an optimal reliability design for HCESs that meets the requirements of multiple collision scenarios in European standard EN 15227.

Recently developed design techniques integrated with additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have enhanced the possibility of fabricating intricate geometries such as honeycomb structures. Generally, failure initiates from the sharp edges in honeycomb structures, which leads to a reduction in stiffness and energy absorption performance. By material quantity, these hinges account for a large amount of material in cells. Therefore, redesigning of honeycomb structures is needed, which can improve aforementioned characteristics. However, this increases the design complexity of honeycombs, such that novel manufacturing techniques such as AM has to be employed. This research attempts to investigate the optimal material distribution of three different topologies of honeycomb structures (hexagonal, triangular, and square) with nine different design configurations. To achieve this, higher amount of material was distributed at nodes in the form of fillets while keeping overall weight of the structure constant. Furthermore, these design configurations were analyzed in terms of stiffness, energy absorption, and the failure behavior by performing finite element analysis and experimental tests on the samples manufactured using Multijet fusion AM technology. It was found that adding material to the edges can improve the mechanical properties of honeycombs such as stiffness and energy absorption efficiency. Furthermore, the failure mechanism is changed due to redistribution of material in the structure. The design configurations without fillets suffer from brittle failure at the start of the plastic deformation, whereas the configurations with increased material proportion at the nodes have larger plastic deformation zones, which improves the energy absorption efficiency. © © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","additive manufacturing; design for AM; energy absorption efficiency; fillets; honeycomb structure; optimal material distribution; stiffness","3D printers; Absorption efficiency; Additives; Energy absorption; Fabrication; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Structural design; Structural optimization; Additive manufacturing technology; Design configurations; Design for additive manufacturing; Energy absorption efficiency; Fillet; Material distribution; Mechanical performance; Multi-jets; Optimal material distribution; Optimal materials; Stiffness","Nazir, Aamer, A state-of-the-art review on types, design, optimization, and additive manufacturing of cellular structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 104, 9-12, pp. 3489-3510, (2019); Li, Yan, A Review on Functionally Graded Materials and Structures via Additive Manufacturing: From Multi-Scale Design to Versatile Functional Properties, Advanced Materials Technologies, 5, 6, (2020); Rahman, Oyindamola, Density-Graded Cellular Solids: Mechanics, Fabrication, and Applications, Advanced Engineering Materials, 24, 1, (2022); Zhang, Xuezhe, Selective electron beam manufactured Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures for orthopedic implant applications: Current status and outstanding challenges, Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science, 22, 3, pp. 75-99, (2018); Yancey, Robert N., Challenges, Opportunities, and Perspectives on Lightweight Composite Structures: Aerospace Versus Automotive, pp. 35-52, (2016); Challis, Vivien J., High specific strength and stiffness structures produced using selective laser melting, Materials and Design, 63, pp. 783-788, (2014); Ajdari, Amin, Dynamic crushing and energy absorption of regular, irregular and functionally graded cellular structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 3-4, pp. 506-516, (2011); Habib, Fatah N., In-plane energy absorption evaluation of 3D printed polymeric honeycombs, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 12, 2, pp. 117-131, (2017); Ingrole, Aniket, Design and modeling of auxetic and hybrid honeycomb structures for in-plane property enhancement, Materials and Design, 117, pp. 72-83, (2017); Ushijima, Kuniharu, Energy absorption efficiency in cellular solids, International Journal of Modern Physics B, 22, 9-11, pp. 1730-1735, (2008)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

According to Euler theory and buckling failure theory, compression deformation properties of bio-inspired structures are explained. Experiments and simulations further verify the accuracy of theoretical analysis results. The results show that energy absorption of FLAHS is, respectively, increased by 26.95%, 22.85%, and 121.45%, compared with RAHS, SAHS, and FUAHS. Elastic modulus of FLAHS is 110.37%, 110.37%, and 230.56% of RAHS, SAHS, and FUAHS, respectively. FLAHS perfectly inherits crashworthiness and energy absorption properties of the Gideon beetle, and FLAHS has the most stable force. Similarly, RAHS, SAHS, and FUAHS, respectively, inherit mechanical properties of the Gideon beetle top horn, the Gideon beetle middle horn, and the abdomen of the beetle.

Drawing inspiration from social insect hexagonal cell nests, where a non-zero corner radius appears to be a design feature, a 400-point design of experiments study is conducted using 2D plane strain Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to study the influence of cell size, beam thickness and corner radius on effective modulus and maximum corner stress in the honeycomb cells. An experimental study is conducted to examine these relationships beyond the bounds of the small deformation, linear elastic FEA analysis. The study finds that corner radii always increase the effective modulus of the honeycomb, even after accounting for the additional mass associated with the corner fillet. A key finding of this work is that while corner radii also reduces the maximum corner stress, there exists a clear optimum, beyond which stresses rise again as the corner radius increases in magnitude. This optimum corner radius is shown to be a function of the beam thickness (t) to beam length (l) ratio (t/l), with the optimum value increasing with increasing t/l. The experimental study shows that the presence of a corner radius shifts the failure mechanism from nodal fracture to plastic hinging for honeycombs with thick beams, and may have benefits for energy absorption applications. This work makes the case for the treatment of the corner radius as an independent design feature for optimization in the wider context of cellular materials, as well as has implications for the study of the geometry of insect nests. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Corner radius; Fillet; Honeycomb; Parametric optimization","3D printers; Cellular manufacturing; Design of experiments; Failure (mechanical); Strain; Beam thickness; Compression loading; Corner radius; Design features; Effective moduli; Fillet; Hexagonal honeycomb; In-plane compression; Parametric optimization; Quasi-static compression; Honeycomb structures","Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Hales, Thomas C., The honeycomb conjecture, Discrete and Computational Geometry, 25, 1, pp. 1-22, (2001); American Museum Novitates, (1998); Bhate, Dhruv, Four questions in cellular material design, Materials, 12, 7, (2019); Goss, Derek, Bioinspired honeycomb core design: An experimental study of the role of corner radius, coping and interface, Biomimetics, 5, 4, pp. 1-24, (2020); Lee, P.

To further increase its performance and optimize its structural parameters, the surrogate model of specific energy absorption (SEA) and initial peak crushing force (PCF) is constructed. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to carry out the multi-objective optimization for BSH. Parametric studies show that the relationship between the SEA and amplitude is not obvious, while the PCF increases with the increase of amplitude, and both the SEA and PCF increase as the wall thickness increases. Moreover, the Pareto frontiers of the four BSHs with different wavenumbers have a certain similarity. Compared with the original solution, the optimal solution of the BSH is 2.5 T under the constraints, where the PCF decreases by 15.52%, and the SEA increases by 6.77%.

In this study, the contributions of metallurgical factors under different scanning speeds, such as Ni evaporation, Ni<inf>4</inf>Ti<inf>3</inf> precipitation, dislocations and internal stress, to the transformation temperature and transformation latent heat were clarified through specially designed experiments. Ni evaporation is found to have the most profound effect, followed by precipitation. Increasing scanning speed is found to reduce Ni loss, thus cause less increase in the transformation temperature and transformation heat of the LPBF-NiTi alloys. Increasing scanning speed also increases the microstructure non-uniformity and thus widens the transformation temperature interval. The orientations of residual stress exhibit strong crystallographic stiffness dependence. The LPBF-NiTi alloys with different scanning speeds all exhibited high strains (>13.4%) and excellent shape memory effect. A LPBF-NiTi honeycomb structure exhibited 96% shape recovery rate after a 60% pre-compressive deformation. Besides, there is an optimum scanning speed for minimum porosity and smallest average pore size. However, the pore structure is found to have weak influence on the tensile behaviour of the LPBF-NiTi alloys, possibly due to the high defect tolerance of the martensitic transformation. © 2022","Laser powder bed fusion; Laser scanning speed; Martensitic transformation; NiTi shape memory alloy; Residual stress","Bending strength; Binary alloys; Energy absorption; Evaporation; Fabrication; Honeycomb structures; Martensitic transformations; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Pore structure; Residual stresses; Scanning; Shape optimization; Shape-memory alloy; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser scanning speed; NiTi alloys; NiTi shape memory alloys; Phase properties; Phases transformation; Powder bed; Scanning speed; Transformation temperatures; Pore size","Mohd Jani, Jaronie, A review of shape memory alloy research, applications and opportunities, Materials and Design, 56, pp. 1078-1113, (2014); Chau, E.

This results in a problem formulation where the nonlinear properties are estimated using a finitely periodic structure. An interesting base material choice for energy absorption are bulk metallic glasses for which we optimize the designs and fabricate them through a thermoplastic processing method. Testing to full densification reveals that the governing mechanisms for these topologically-optimized structures are combinations of buckling and yielding at the strut-level.

Various fiber layups of the fiberglass face sheet and core designs were fabricated and tested for their indentation resistance and acoustic absorption performance. It was found that the bidirectional face sheet layup exhibited the best indentation energy absorption recording 4.2 J, which is 37% more than the 45-degree layout and 66% more than the quasi-isotropic layup. The specific energy absorption of the hybrid honeycomb core is the best among the three core designs recording 404 J/kg, which is 56% higher than the corrugated triangle with horizontal beam core (359 J/kg) and 20% higher than double ellipse core (335 J/kg). Computed-Tomography (CT) scan was used to study the fracture behavior of the sandwich structures. It was found that the bidirectional layup exhibited a different failure mode as compared to the 45-degree and quasi-isotropic layup. In terms of the acoustic properties, the face sheets with various layup patterns have a low acoustic absorption coefficient with minimal differences from each other at low frequencies (500 Hz–3000 Hz) and have higher absorption coefficients with greater differences from each other at frequencies between 3000 Hz–6500 Hz. The absorption curve was significantly affected by the design of the core. The orientation of the core also comes into play if the core is asymmetrical. The hybrid honeycomb sandwich structure was the optimal structure among the three designs for balanced indentation resistance and acoustic insulation. © The Author(s) 2021.","3D printing; acoustic properties; micro-computed tomography; Quasi-static indentation; sandwich structures","Acoustic properties; Acoustic wave absorption; Computerized tomography; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural optimization; Absorption co-efficient; Acoustic absorption; Acoustic absorption coefficients; Computed tomography scan; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Indentation resistance; Quasi-static indentation; Specific energy absorption; 3D printers","Kawada, Tomoyuiki, The Effect of Noise on the Health of Children, Journal of Nippon Medical School, 71, 1, pp. 5-10, (2004); Slovak J Anim Sci, (2014); Nasiri, Parvin, The effect of noise on human performance: A clinical trial, International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 4, 2, pp. 87-95, (2013); Weinstein, Neil David, Effect of noise on intellectual performance, Journal of Applied Psychology, 59, 5, pp. 548-554, (1974); International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, (2014); Yang, Han Seung, Rice straw-wood particle composite for sound absorbing wooden construction materials, Bioresource Technology, 86, 2, pp. 117-121, (2003); undefined, (2016); Arenas, Jorge P., Recent trends in porous sound-absorbing materials, Sound and Vibration, 44, 7, pp. 12-17, (2010); Castagnède, Bernard R.J., Effects of compression on the sound absorption of fibrous materials, Applied Acoustics, 61, 2, pp. 173-182, (2000); Fuchs, Helmut V., Micro-perforated structures as sound absorbers - A review and outlook, Acta Acustica United with Acustica, 92, 1, pp. 139-146, (2006)",""

A crash box filled with negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb based on horn structure was designed by extracting its excellent structural characteristics of impact resistance. The axial deformation modes and energy absorption characteristics of bionic crash box are investigated by means of finite element method, and compared with square crash box, diagonal crash box and side-to-side crash box. Under axial impact, the horn-bionic crash box shows significantly better load-carrying and energy-absorbing capacity than the square crash box and the diagonal crash box. On this basis, the thickness parameters, multi-objective optimization design and structure improvement design of horn-bionic crash box are studied successively in this work. The results show that the improved bionic crash box based on horn structure has a typical progressive shrinkage deformation mode. Its SEA reaches 29.9 kJ/kg, which is 2.5 times that of the square crash box, and its PCF is also greatly reduced from 542.4 kN to 391.1 kN. Therefore, the methods of structural improvement such as pre-deformed treatment, constraint beam adjustment and shortening the NPR core can effectively reduce the PCF of the crash box, and improve its energy absorption capacity, so as to obtain better comprehensive crashworthiness. Introducing the key characteristics of the horn structure into the design of the car crash box can effectively improve structural crashworthiness and provide new design guidance for the other energy-absorption components of vehicle. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cattle horn; crash box; crashworthiness; negative Poisson's ratio (NPR); Structural bionics","Accidents; Crashworthiness; Deformation; Energy absorption; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Structural optimization; Axial deformations; Cattle horn; Crash box; Crashworthiness designs; Deformation modes; Horn structures; Negative Poisson ratio; Structural bionic; Structural characteristics; Bionics","Lee, Se-jung, Design flow for the crash box in a vehicle to maximize energy absorption, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 227, 2, pp. 179-200, (2013); Abdullah, N.

Additive manufacturing technology advancements have paved the way for lattice structure development. The sandwich protective structure designs are evaluated computationally using a non-linear dynamic finite element analysis for various geometry and material parameters. The lattice structure’s optimum shape was obtained based on the highest Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) parameter developed using the ANOVA and Taguchi robust design method. It is found that the octet-cross lattice structure with 40% relative density provided the best performance in terms of absorbing impact energy. Furthermore, the sandwich panel construction with two layers of lattice structure core performed very well in protecting the lithium-ion NCA battery in the ground impact loading conditions, which the impactor velocity is 42 m/s, representing vehicle velocity in highway, and weigh 0.77 kg.

In this paper, CFRP/aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels are taken as the target. Firstly, the accuracy of the simulation is determined by comparing the numerical simulation with the experimental results. Secondly, numerical simulation is carried out by combining front and rear panels with different thicknesses, multi-layer and different honeycomb apertures. The analysis shows that the thicker the rear panel is, the stronger the impact resistance of the sandwich panel is. The energy absorption effect of the sandwich panel was increased by 21.75% when the rear panel was 5.5 mm compared with that of the front panel. At the same thickness, the impact resistance of multi-layer sandwich panels is enhanced with the increase of layers, and the energy consumption of eight-layer sandwich panels is increased by 21.22% compared with that of single-layer sandwich panels. When the thickness of the rear panel is unchanged, the increase of the aperture of aluminum honeycomb has an exponential relationship with the energy absorption of the sandwich panel. Finally, the energy absorption value of the sandwich panels is fitted with the thickness of each layer, the relationship between the energy absorption value of the sandwich panels ΔE (Y) and the thickness of each part of the sandwich panels (A, B, C) is obtained. The optimal solution is obtained under specific constraint conditions and the combination modes of sandwich panels. © 2021 Society of Plastics Engineers.","","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Elastomers; Energy utilization; Honeycomb structures; Numerical models; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Structural optimization; Aluminium honeycomb; Carbon fiber reinforced plastic/aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Combination modes; Design-expert; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Multi-layer combination; Multi-layers; Sandwich panel; Structural optimisations; Energy absorption","Mechanics in Engineering, (2015); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Li, Wei, Application of carbon fiber composites to cosmonautic fields, Chinese Optics, 4, 3, pp. 201-212, (2011); Electric Locomotives Mass Transit Vehicles, (2015); Ivañez, Inés, The oblique impact response of composite sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 1127-1136, (2015); Zonghong, Xie, On residual compressive strength prediction of composite sandwich panels after low-velocity impact damage, Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, 19, 1, pp. 9-17, (2006); Zhang, Dahai, Experimental and numerical investigation on indentation and energy absorption of a honeycomb sandwich panel under low-velocity impact, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 117-118, pp. 21-30, (2016); Alavi, Ali, Ballistic limit determination of aluminum honeycombs-Experimental study, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 488, 1-2, pp. 273-280, (2008); Trans Beijing Inst Technol, (2013); Kolopp, Amélie, Experimental study of sandwich structures as armour against medium-velocity impacts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 61, pp. 24-35, (2013)",""

In this paper, the finite element models of four typical cellular structures (hexagon honeycomb, re-entrant hexagon honeycomb, star-shape honeycomb, double arrow honeycomb) are established and experimentally validated. The dynamic responses of four structures under different impact angles (from 0 to 30°) and impact velocities (from 5 to 50 m/s) are investigated. On this basis, the influences of impact angle and impact velocity on the specific energy absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) of four structures are discussed. The results reveal that the negative Poisson’s ratio structure has the advantage of energy absorption under axial impact due to the characteristics of compression and contraction at the low impact velocity. The hexagonal honeycomb structure has great advantages in terms of comprehensive energy absorption capacity and better stability at varying inclination angles. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with the ideal point method (IPM) is utilised to explore the optimal design of hexagon honeycomb structure, which is then verified by a detailed crashworthiness comparison with the original design. The optimal honeycomb structure shows excellent crashworthiness characteristics and demonstrates great potential for applications in impact engineering, especially the oblique impact loading situations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures; Multi-objective; Oblique impact","Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Genetic algorithms; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Structural optimization; Cellular structure; Comprehensive energy; Hexagonal honeycomb; Ideal point methods; Inclination angles; Low-impact velocity; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Specific energy absorption; Structural design","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Alderson, Andrew, Auxetic materials, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 221, 4, pp. 565-575, (2007); Cellular Materials in Nature and Medicine, (2010); Prawoto, Yunan, Seeing auxetic materials from the mechanics point of view: A structural review on the negative Poisson's ratio, Computational Materials Science, 58, pp. 140-153, (2012); Hao, Wenqian, Theoretical prediction of the progressive buckling and energy absorption of the sinusoidal corrugated tube subjected to axial crushing, Computers and Structures, 191, pp. 12-21, (2017); Ma, Fangwu, Crashworthiness Optimization Design of Thin-Walled Tube Filled with Re-entrant Triangles Honeycombs, Automotive Innovation, 2, 1, pp. 1-13, (2019); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Ma, Fangwu, Effects of Cell Microtopology on the In-plane Dynamic Crushing Analysis of Re-entrant Square Cellular Material, Automotive Innovation, 1, 1, pp. 24-34, (2018); Ma, Fangwu, Theoretical study and simulation analysis on re-entrant square cellular material’s mechanical properties, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 10, 4, (2018)",""

In this work, a novel multi-cell hierarchical hexagon honeycomb structure (HHHS) was obtained by changing the topological connection, of which structure is ruled by a length coefficient defined as the ratio of 1st and 2nd hexagon honeycomb. The effect of wall thickness and length coefficient on structural energy performance was numerically investigated using finite element model validated by experiments.

Although lightweight increases natural frequency, low stiffness of cellular structures reduces natural frequency. Designing structures with higher natural frequency can usually avoid resonance. In addition, because of the less amount of materials used in cellular structures, the energy absorption capability usually decreases such as under impact loading. Therefore, designing cellular structures with higher natural frequency and higher energy absorption capability is highly desired. In this study, machine learning and novel inverse design techniques enable to search a huge space of unexplored structural designs. In this study, machine learning regression and Generative Neural Networks (GANs) were used to form an inverse design framework. Optimal cellular unit cells that surpass the performance of biomimetic structures inspired from honeycomb, plant stems and trabecular bone in terms of natural frequency and impact resistance were discovered using machine learning. The discovered optimal cellular unit cells exhibited 30–100% higher natural frequency and 300% higher energy absorption than those of the biomimetic counterparts. The discovered optimal unit cells were validated through experimental and simulation comparisons.

The purpose of this study is to explore the bending response and energy absorption of the star-triangular honeycomb core (STH-C) and sandwich beam with an STH-C (STH-SW). Three-point bending tests and a series of numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the bending performance of the sandwich beams. The results indicate that STH-C exhibits only local bending deformation in the loading region, whereas the cells of the STH-SW undergo shrinkage deformation in the loading region, and the neighboring cells undergo tensile deformation. In addition, the deformation mode of the STH-SW is influenced by the compression position and structural parameters. Increasing the face sheet thickness and changing the thickness arrangements is beneficial to improving the load-bearing capacity of the sandwich beams, especially when t<inf>f</inf>/t<inf>b</inf>>1. Furthermore, the load-bearing capacity of the sandwich beams increase with the increase of the cell-wall angle and t/l, and increasing the t/l can change the cells from a global deformation to a local deformation mode. Subsequently, the complex proportional assessment method (COPRAS) is implemented to determine the influence weights of the structural parameters on the load-bearing capacity of the sandwich beams. The results demonstrate that the cell structure parameters have a more significant influence on the bending performance, especially the t/l. Finally, the bending performance of the STH-SW is compared with that of sandwich beams with different cores (star-shaped, re-entrant hexagonal and triangular corrugated structures). The results show that the energy absorption capacity of the STH-SW is 24.34% and 37.97% higher than that of sandwich beams with star-shaped and re-entrant hexagonal cores, respectively. Although the energy absorption capacity of the STH-SW is 10.25% less than that of multi-layer triangular corrugated core sandwich beam, there is no initial peak load for the STH-SW.

In this paper, the dynamic crushing properties and energy absorption capacities of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs with different topologies were explored by means of explicit dynamic finite element (FE) analysis using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Four types of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs with uniform cell-wall thickness were firstly constructed by substituting each vertex of regular honeycombs with a smaller self-similar cell (hexagon or square). The respective influences of hierarchical parameters and impact velocities on in-plane dynamic deformation modes, mechanical characteristic and energy absorption of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs were discussed. Research results showed that the hierarchy had a far greater influence on the in-plane deformation modes of honeycombs. Compared with regular honeycombs, the dynamic plateau stress and specific energy absorption of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs can be improved if the proper hierarchical parameters were chosen. Adding the joint-based hierarchy into regular honeycombs can enhance the crushing stress efficiency (CSE) of the specimens. In addition, by introducing a non-dimensional dynamic sensitivity index, the dynamic shock enhancement of hierarchical honeycombs was also investigated. These researches are useful for the multi-objective dynamic optimization design and controllable properties of cellular materials. © The Author(s) 2021.","energy absorption; Hierarchical honeycombs; in-plane crushing; joint-based; plateau stress","Crushing; Deformation; Energy absorption; Topology; Dynamic deformation mode; Dynamic optimization design; Dynamic plateau stress; Energy absorption capacity; Explicit dynamic finite element; In-plane dynamic crushing; Mechanical characteristics; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Sun, Yongle, Dynamic compressive behaviour of cellular materials: A review of phenomenon, mechanism and modelling, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 112, pp. 74-115, (2018); Zhu, Feng, Analytical investigation and optimal design of sandwich panels subjected to shock loading, Materials and Design, 30, 1, pp. 91-100, (2009); Chen, Liming, Numerical study on the projectile impact resistance of multi-layer sandwich panels with cellular cores, Latin American Journal of Solids and Structures, 13, 15, pp. 2576-2595, (2016); Pattofatto, Stéphane, Shock enhancement of cellular structures under impact loading: Part II analysis, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2672-2686, (2007); Qiu, Xinming, Collapse of periodic planar lattices under uniaxial compression, part II: Dynamic crushing based on finite element simulation, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 10-11, pp. 1231-1241, (2009); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing strength of hexagonal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 467-474, (2010); Mukhopadhyay, T., Effective in-plane elastic moduli of quasi-random spatially irregular hexagonal lattices, International Journal of Engineering Science, 119, pp. 142-179, (2017); Mukhopadhyay, T., Equivalent in-plane elastic properties of irregular honeycombs: An analytical approach, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 91, pp. 169-184, (2016); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003)",""

Sacrificial cladding systems based on negative Poisson’s ratio core topologies have recently received more attention as a protective technology due to its excellent energy absorption capability. In this study, field blast tests were performed on metallic re-entrant honeycomb-cored sacrificial cladding systems as protective structures for steel plate structures. This study focused on the near-field blast loading conditions where liquid Nitromethane (NM) spherical charges were detonated in close proximity to the main structure. Two 6 mm thick mild steel plates and two steel plates protected with re-entrant honeycomb-cored sacrificial cladding systems were among the specimens tested. The proposed auxetic cladding system was fabricated from aluminium sheets using a novel in-house built folding machine. Numerical simulations were conducted utilising LS-DYNA software and the Blast Impact Impulse Model (BIIM). The results obtained from the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results. It was found that the deformation pattern of the sacrificial auxetic cladding system varies with the intensity of the blast loading, and there is a limit at which the proposed protective system ceases to effectively absorb the applied blast loading. The variation of negative Poisson’s ratio of the system with blast loading was studied. It was found that the auxetic cladding system could become a solid projectile leading to damage amplification for very close-range blast loads due to rapid densification of the auxetic core. The proposed cladding systems with narrow re-entrant angles performed well under blast loads due to relatively low stiffness of the panels. Finally, the optimisation study was performed for the protective system. Overall, the experimental and numerical results assure that auxetic-based cladding systems are suitable for applications requiring blast protection such as armoured vehicles and critical physical infrastructure but need to be carefully designed for the given blast threat to prevent overloading of the protected structures. © The Author(s) 2020.","auxetic; blast impulse; close-in blast; explosives; LS-DYNA; re-entrant honeycomb; Sacrificial cladding systems; sandwich panel","Aluminum coated steel; Armored vehicles; Cladding (coating); Critical infrastructures; Dynamic loads; Honeycomb structures; Military vehicles; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Religious buildings; Steel testing; Terrorism; Damage amplifications; Deformation pattern; Energy absorption capability; Government buildings; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Protective structures; Rapid densification; Terrorist activities; Blast resistance","undefined; Chen, Wensu, Numerical analysis of prestressed reinforced concrete beam subjected to blast loading, Materials and Design, 65, pp. 662-674, (2015); Remennikov, Alex M., Explosive testing and modelling of square tubular steel columns for near-field detonations, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 101, pp. 290-303, (2014); Wei, Wang, Experimental study and numerical simulation of the damage mode of a square reinforced concrete slab under close-in explosion, Engineering Failure Analysis, 27, pp. 41-51, (2013); Thiagarajan, Ganesh, Experimental and finite element analysis of doubly reinforced concrete slabs subjected to blast loads, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 162-173, (2015); Rao, Bin, Dynamic responses of reinforced concrete beams under double-end-initiated close-in explosion, Defence Technology, 14, 5, pp. 527-539, (2018); van Paepegem, Wim V., Blast performance of a sacrificial cladding with composite tubes for protection of civil engineering structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 65, pp. 131-146, (2014); Codina, Ramón H., New sacrificial cladding system for the reduction of blast damage in reinforced concrete structures, International Journal of Protective Structures, 8, 2, pp. 221-236, (2017); Wu, Chengqing, A finite element modelling to investigate the mitigation of blast effects on reinforced concrete panel using foam cladding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 55, pp. 24-33, (2013); Ma, Guowei, Analysis of foam claddings for blast alleviation, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 34, 1, pp. 60-70, (2007)",""

Among the materials commonly used for AM, thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) are of high interest due to their energy absorption capacity, energy efficiency, cushion factor or damping capacity. Previous investigations have exclusively focused on the optimization of the printing parameters of commercial TPE filaments and the structures to analyse the mechanical properties of the 3D printed parts. In the present paper, the chemical, thermal and mechanical properties for a wide range of commercial thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) filaments were investigated. For this purpose, TGA, DSC,1H-NMR and filament tensile strength experiments were carried out in order to determine the materials characteristics. In addition, compression tests have been carried out to tailor the mechanical properties depending on the 3D printing parameters such as: Infill density (10, 20, 50, 80 and 100%) and infill pattern (gyroid, honeycomb and grid). The compression tests were also employed to calculate the specific energy absorption (SEA) and specific damping capacity (SDC) of the materials in order to establish the role of the chemical composition and the geometrical characteristics (infill density and type of infill pattern) on the final properties of the printed part. As a result, optimal SEA and SDC performances were obtained for a honeycomb pattern at a 50% of infill density. © 2021 by the authors.

The crushing performance of the auxetic hierarchical crash box is systematically investigated. The comparisons of energy absorption ability are made among the auxetic hierarchical crash box, aluminum foam-filled crash box, and the traditional crash box. In addition, a multi-objective optimization design is conducted based on the surrogate model with higher accuracy. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and archive-based micro genetic algorithm (AMGA) are, respectively, employed to obtain the pareto sets. The results show that the optimum solution with AMGA has a smaller relative error, and the multi-objective optimization successfully improves the crushing performance of the auxetic hierarchical crash box. The electric vehicle crashworthiness is remarkably improved by the application of the auxetic hierarchical crash box.

A parametric study is conducted by ABAQUS/explicit to investigate the effects of geometric configurations (corrugation angle, core height, and core thickness) on the deformation mode, peak force, and energy absorption. Both peak force and specific energy absorption vary with the geometric parameters. Theoretical models are further developed to predict the force–displacement curves of the panels under the two loading conditions.

Often, these porous structures exhibit continuous flow passages that allow for cooling fluids to pass through, thus enabling simultaneous load-bearing and active heat dissipation. This study investigated the convective cooling efficiency of a sandwich panel with hierarchical corrugated core subjected to heating from the face sheets and active cooling through the core. Built upon the classical fin approach, a theoretical model coupling wall heat conduction and fluid convection in the core was established for the hierarchical corrugated-core sandwich panel, covering the full range of fluid flow (from laminar, transition to turbulent). The theoretical model predictions were validated against full numerical simulations. Based on the theoretical model, an artificial intelligence optimization method (i.e., the ant colony algorithm) was adopted to find the optimal combination of key independent geometric parameters of the sandwich panel for maximized heat transfer performance. For the problem of multi-variables optimization, it was demonstrated that the ant colony algorithm is superior in terms of computational time to the traditional exhaustive search method. For a given pressure drop, a set of optimum geometric parameters corresponding to maximum cooling efficiency was found for the proposed hierarchical corrugated-core sandwich panel. © 2021","Artificial intelligence optimization; Heat transfer; Hierarchical porous structure; Sandwich panel; Thermo-mechanical design","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Bearings (machine parts); Biomimetic materials; Biomimetics; Bionics; Cooling; Flow of fluids; Heat conduction; Heat convection; Heat transfer performance; Porosity; Sandwich structures; Structural design; Vibrations (mechanical); Ant colonies algorithm; Artificial intelligence optimization; Cooling efficiency; Corrugated core; Heat transfer efficiency; Hierarchical porous structures; Load-bearing; Sandwich panel; Theoretical modeling; Thermo-mechanical design; Honeycomb structures","Jia, Zian, Biomimetic architected materials with improved dynamic performance, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 125, pp. 178-197, (2019); Rabiei, Reza, Hierarchical structure, mechanical properties and fabrication of biomimetic biomaterials, pp. 67-90, (2013); Barthelat, François, Biomimetics for next generation materials, Philosophical transactions.

Then, by iteratively modifying the local EIE target, the cellular structure is optimized until the maximum energy absorption (EA) is obtained under the specific volume fraction constraint.

Hence, in this study, a series of novel fractal honeycombs are proposed based on the combination of functionally gradient with fractal self-similarity features, which are constructed by varying the fractal parameter in each layer of the traditional self-similar honeycombs. Two graded fractal honeycombs with symmetric gradient and another two with asymmetric gradient are presented, and their dynamic crushing behaviors are numerically investigated. The numerical approach is first validated by comparing against theoretical and experimental data. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the SG-I honeycomb can present the best energy absorption behavior (89% higher than traditional honeycomb) for low-velocity impact, while SG-II honeycomb performs the best for specific energy absorption (17% larger than traditional honeycomb) for high-velocity impact. Furthermore, deformation patterns under dynamic crushing can be controlled through the introduction of different gradient distributions.

First, five materials with different cell thickness/cell size ratios (t<inf>0</inf>/a) were designed, and compression tests were performed under quasi-static conditions. The results show that the initial peak stress and the plateau stress both increase with the increase of the t<inf>0</inf>/a ratio. The plateau zone determines the energy absorption performance; therefore, this study focuses on the analysis of the mechanical properties of the plateau stage.

And the geometric parameters (e.g., the amplitude and period) of the sinusoidal curve that affect the energy absorption performance of the structure are analyzed.

The results show that the addition of continuous fibers enables the honeycomb structure to avoid catastrophic failure even at high levels of deformation, which allows the shape memory effect to be activated and nearly 87% percent of the initial structural shape to be recovered. Moreover, the reinforced honeycombs exhibit enhanced properties: the specific energy absorption and specific stiffness of the reinforced honeycombs are up to 2 times greater than those of the conventional honeycombs.

In this paper, the two-dimensional metallic DAHs were produced and used as the sandwich cores to construct the large-size double arrowhead honeycomb sandwich panels (DAHSPs). A comprehensive experimental investigation on their dynamic responses under the paper tube-guided air blasts was conducted. It majorly focused on the influence of core configurations induced by the variation of core wall thickness, horizontal distance, inclined angles, thickness allocations and foam filling on the deformation/failure modes, associated mechanisms and blast resistance of the target panels. Fair comparisons among different design strategies were performed to evaluate their relative performance. Experimental results show that relative to increasing the core wall thickness, the decrease of horizontal distance is more remarkable to reduce the back face deflection upon the similar weight expense, whereas the effect of inclined angles is limited due to the competition between enhanced bending stiffness and deteriorated transmitted load. A more efficient approach to decrease the back face deformation is to enlarge the inclined angles when the core relative density is relatively low but to decrease the horizontal distance at a high level of relative density. A further improvement of blast resistance can be achieved by allocating more mass to the stuffer wall rather than the tendon one, or by introducing a gradient DAH core instead of the homogeneous one. Compared to adjusting the metallic DAH core itself, the lightweight polyurethane (PU) foam filling is a more competitive manner to promote the blast performance.

The graded honeycombs were additively manufactured by fused deposition modeling (FDM) with polylactic acid (PLA) and then tested for axial crushing. Numerical simulation models were constructed through LS-DYNA and validated using experiment results. Based on the super folding element (SFE) method, theoretical models of the proposed bi-graded honeycombs were derived and the accuracy for crushing response was validated against the numerical results. Finally, an active learning based multi-objective optimization algorithm was used to seek the optimal design. The results showed that the bi-graded design for honeycomb structures could improve energy absorption capacity and decrease the peak crushing force in the Pareto frontier manner.

It adopts three honeycomb structures of the same mass and three kinds of aluminum alloy to determine the optimal structure and material scheme of the protective shell. Besides, sensitivity analysis is selected to screen the design parameters of the optimal structure scheme. Based on this, the overall mass of the designed protective shell, the specific energy absorption of NPR structure, the maximum impact force of rigid wall, and the maximum stress of the liner are taken to establish the optimization mathematical model. Furthermore, adaptive mutation genetic algorithm (AMGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-ii (NSGA-II), and adaptive simulated annealing algorithm (ASA) are exerted as the optimization algorithms separately to conduct optimization design and a comparison is made between the optimization results. The results show that the optimized energy-absorbing protective shell has better crashworthiness and energy absorption effect, which can effectively improve the collision safety of the hydrogen cylinder.

The main goal is to improve the energy absorption capacity of the out-of-plane honeycomb sandwich beam. The novel Beta VI and Alpha VI were designed in order to achieve this aim. In the Beta VI, the connecting curves (splines) were used instead of the four diagonal walls, while the two vertical walls remained unchanged. The Alpha VI is a step forward on the Beta VI, which was promoted by filleting all angles among the vertical walls, created arcs, and face sheets. The two offered sandwich structures have not hitherto been provided in the literature. All models were designed and simulated by the CATIA and ABAQUS, respectively. The three-dimensional printer fabricated the samples by fused deposition modeling technique. The material properties were determined under tensile, compression, and three-point bending tests. The results are carried out by two methods based on experimental tests and finite element analyses that confirmed each other. The achievements provide novel insights into the determination of the adequate number of unit cells and demonstrate the energy absorption capacity of the Beta VI and Alpha VI are 23.7% and 53.9%, respectively, higher than the out-of-plane honeycomb sandwich structures. © IMechE 2021.","Energy absorption capacity; experimental tests; finite element optimization; material characterization tests; out-of-plane honeycomb; sandwich structures; three-dimensional printing","Bending dies; Bending tests; Fused Deposition Modeling; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Deposition modeling; Energy absorption capacity; Experimental investigations; Experimental test; Honeycomb sandwich; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Number of unit cells; Three-point bending test; Energy absorption","Soltani, Aref, 3D printing on-water sports boards with bio-inspired core designs, Polymers, 12, 1, (2020); Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Yazdani Sarvestani, Hamidreza, 3D printed meta-sandwich structures: Failure mechanism, energy absorption and multi-hit capability, Materials and Design, 160, pp. 179-193, (2018); Yang, Hang, Mechanical properties of 3D double-U auxetic structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 180-181, pp. 13-29, (2019); Li, Tiantian, Exploiting negative Poisson's ratio to design 3D-printed composites with enhanced mechanical properties, Materials and Design, 142, pp. 247-258, (2018); Bodaghi, M., Reversible energy absorbing meta-sandwiches by FDM 4D printing, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 173, (2020); Yin, Sha, Introducing composite lattice core sandwich structure as an alternative proposal for engine hood, Composite Structures, 201, pp. 131-140, (2018); Bodaghi, M., Large deformations of soft metamaterials fabricated by 3D printing, Materials and Design, 131, pp. 81-91, (2017); Hedayati, Reza, Semianalytical Geometry-Property Relationships for Some Generalized Classes of Pentamodelike Additively Manufactured Mechanical Metamaterials, Physical Review Applied, 11, 3, (2019); Bodaghi, M., 4D printed tunable mechanical metamaterials with shape memory operations, Smart Materials and Structures, 28, 4, (2019)",""

A finite element model for the prediction of dynamic responses of trapezoidal corrugated core sandwich panel was first proposed and validated by experiments. Based on the simulation results, kriging models were established to approximate the relationships between design variables and blast performances, and correlation analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of the design variables on the maximum back face deflection and specific energy absorption. It is found that any decrease in maximum back face deflection would always lead to undesirable deterioration in specific energy absorption, and the correlation relationships are associated with the stand-off distance. Using the developed kriging models, multi-objective design optimization was performed to seek trade-off solutions for the trapezoidal corrugated core sandwich panel under specific and variable stand-off distances. Results show that the design on Pareto fronts depended upon stand-off distance. Comparisons of the blast performance between optimized designs and initial designs turned out that there indeed existed a great potential in performance improvement.

Regarding the effects of adjacent unit cells, a mechanics-based homogenization approach is put forward and employed to derive static mechanical properties including elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ROHs under axial loading. Based on above, the predominant compression failure mode is explored. Then, the static mechanical properties and finite element model of ROH are validated by experiment and demonstrate high accuracy. Subsequently, to obtain dynamic responses of the ROH under dynamic impact loading, the relations among dynamic plateau stress and quasi-static plateau stress, initial density, dense strain and impact velocities are established under the conditions of mass conservation and momentum theorem based on one-dimensional shock wave theory and ideal rigid-perfectly plastic material model. Besides, dynamic energy absorption models of the ROH under dynamic loading are acquired in consideration of the effects of impact velocities on dense strain, the results show that theoretical models agree quite well with simulation results. On this basis, the application of ROH on automotive energy absorber is studied with the purpose of acquiring superior energy absorption and satisfying lightweight requirements simultaneously. Based on the decoupling thought of stiffness and pedestrian protection, a new design method of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) hood with ROH is put forward in consideration of energy absorption and lightweight requirements. Of this, ROH is regarded as sandwich structure to meet the demands of energy absorption, CFRP plates are treated as outer and inner skins to satisfy the needs of stiffness. Firstly, multi-objective optimization models are set up under the constraints of reasonable structural parameters and negative Poisson's ratio. Then, the NSGA-Ⅱalgorithm is adopted to achieve the optimal Pareto fronts with the targets for maximum unit mass energy absorption and minimum density. Afterwards, the optimization on thicknesses of CFRP layers is carried out to achieve minimum mass under the constraint conditions that the static stiffness of CFRP hood is larger than that of steel hood. In addition, the layering sequence of inner and lower skins are also optimized. Finally, improved overall stiffness, optimized HIC values and similar lightweight space of CFRP hood with ROH are achieved in comparisons with CFRP hood without ROH. Compared with steel hood, the pedestrian protection performance of CFRP hood with ROH is greatly enhanced, 1st free mode increases by 33.9%, and torsional stiffness and bending stiffness increase by 23.1% and 30.8%, respectively. While the weight decreases by 40.1%. The results indicate that the CFRP hood with ROH presents outstanding advantages of pedestrian protection and lightweight design in terms of HIC and stiffness performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular structure; Homogenization theory; Lightweight design; Mechanical models; Negative Poisson's ratio; Pedestrian protection","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Energy absorption; Graphite fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid integrated circuits; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Shock waves; Stiffness; Stress analysis; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP); Dynamic energy absorption; Homogenization approach; Multi-objective optimization models; Negative poisson's ratios; One-dimensional shock wave theories; Quasi-static plateau stress; Static mechanical properties; Failure (mechanical)","Lira, C., A gradient cellular core for aeroengine fan blades based on auxetic configurations, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 22, 9, pp. 907-917, (2011); undefined, (2007); Scarpa, Fabrizio L., Dynamic properties of high structural integrity auxetic open cell foam, Smart Materials and Structures, 13, 1, pp. 49-56, (2004); Karnessis, Nicholas, Uniaxial and buckling mechanical response of auxetic cellular tubes, Smart Materials and Structures, 22, 8, (2013); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Alderson, Andrew, The in-plane linear elastic constants and out-of-plane bending of 3-coordinated ligament and cylinder-ligament honeycombs, Composites Science and Technology, 70, 7, pp. 1034-1041, (2010); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Miller, Wayne, Flatwise buckling optimization of hexachiral and tetrachiral honeycombs, Composites Science and Technology, 70, 7, pp. 1049-1056, (2010); Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Chen, Daiheng, Bending deformation of honeycomb consisting of regular hexagonal cells, Composite Structures, 93, 2, pp. 736-746, (2011)",""

In this paper, the quasi-static and dynamic compression tests of three kinds of 3D-printed NPR convex–concave honeycomb tubes are carried out. The sinusoidal honeycomb wall with equal mass is used to replace the cell wall structure of the conventional square honeycomb tube (CSHT). The influence of geometric morphology on the elastic modulus, peak force, energy absorption, and damage mode of the tube was discussed. The experimental results show that the NPR, peak force, failure mode, and energy absorption of CCHTs can be adjusted by changing the geometric topology of the sinusoidal element. Through the reasonable design of NPR, compared with the equal mass CSHTs, CCHTs could have the comprehensive advantages of relatively high stiffness and strength, enhanced energy absorption, and damage resistance.

The honeycomb structures are optimized by using a surrogate-based optimization approach to achieve maximum specific energy absorption capacity. Three surrogate models polynomial response surface approximations, radial basis functions, and Kriging models are used; Kriging models are found to be the most accurate. The optimum specific energy absorption value obtained for hierarchical honeycomb structures is found to be 148% greater than that of regular honeycomb structures. © IMechE 2020.","Crashworthiness; honeycomb; optimization; specific energy absorption; surrogate model","Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Interpolation; Optimization; Structural panels; Crashworthiness optimization; Explicit finite element analysis; Hexagonal honeycomb; Polynomial response surface approximations; Radial basis functions; Specific energy absorption; Surrogate model; Surrogate-based optimization; Honeycomb structures","McFarland, R.

The heterogeneity of the material leads to complex behavior that is significantly influenced by changes in the geometries, constituents, applied load and their interaction. In this research, experimental design is used to study the interaction of three major design variables i.e. core structure, use of hybrid fibers and addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on failure behavior of the composite. A new strut-based core structure that can be easily 3d printed is proposed and compared with traditional honeycomb, in addition to a hybrid fiber mix of carbon and Kevlar. To minimize designed panel cost while maximizing its energy absorption a mathematical model is formulated. Results reveal that there is a strong interaction between the nanofiller, cores structure and fiber material. This interaction highlights the need to examine design variables simultaneously. An Octet structure combined with carbon fibers and no CNTs offer the best impact resistance for high energy applications. For low energy purposes, Kevlar or a hybrid carbon-Kevlar combined with a honeycomb core provides a more efficient and cost-effective alternative. CNTs enhances the toughness of the panel as the impact energy increases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon nanotubes; Impact resistance; Octet core structure; Optimization; Regression analysis; Sandwich panel composites","3D printers; Carbon nanotubes; Composite structures; Cost effectiveness; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Honeycomb structures; Design variables; Energy applications; Energy purpose; Failure behaviors; Fiber materials; Heterogeneity of the material; Load bearing capabilities; Strong interaction; Structural design","Materials Science and Engineering an Introduction, (1997); Batra, R.

In the present work, continuous fiber reinforced composite honeycomb structures (CFRCHSs) with excellent shape memory properties were manufactured through a fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology, and their out-of-plane/in-plane compression behaviors and energy absorption characteristics were experimentally investigated. The results reveal that the failure process of the 3D printed CFRCHSs under in-plane loading is that the honeycomb cells collapse layer by layer along the loading direction，accompanied by the formation of a localized band. The crashworthiness analysis indicates that the 3D printed CFRCHSs outperform several competitive cellular topologies in the compression strength and specific energy absorption. A simplified analytical model for the in-plane compression strength of CFRCHSs was derived, and good agreement between measurements and predictions was observed.

There are two important performance metrics for legged-type landers: the energy absorption capacity and landing stability. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to optimize the honeycomb buffer of a legged-type lander. Optimization design variables are the dimension parameters of honeycomb and the objective functions are the evaluation parameters of the above two performance metrics. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-body dynamic model of a lander and a finite-element model of the metal honeycomb are established. Based on the simulation results of the finite-element model and the quartic polynomial, the surrogate models are established to evaluate the energy absorption capacity of honeycomb. Considering both the multi-body dynamic model and the surrogate models, the study designed the optimization flow of dimension parameters of honeycomb. Besides, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used for iterative calculation. Findings: Images of surrogate models show the monotonous functional relationship between the honeycomb’s energy absorption characteristics and its dimension parameters. Optimization results show an apparent contradiction among the objective functions. Besides, according to the simulation results, this method can significantly improve the comprehensive performance of the lander. Originality/value: The novel method can effectively reduce the cost of honeycomb compression tests and improve the lander’s design. Therefore, it can be used for optimizing buffers of other types of legged-type landers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dynamics analysis; Finite-element model; Honeycomb buffer; Legged-type lander; Optimization design; Surrogate model","Compression testing; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Honeycomb structures; Interplanetary spacecraft; Landing; Comprehensive performance; Dynamics analysis; Energy absorption capacity; Finite element modelling (FEM); Honeycomb buffer; Legged-type lander; Novel methods; Optimization design; Performance metrices; Surrogate modeling; Iterative methods","Aravind, G., Design, Analysis and Stability testing of Lunar Lander for Soft-Landing, Materials Today: Proceedings, 24, pp. 1235-1243, (2020); Chen, Jinbao, Research of the factors of buffering performance in lunar lander, Yuhang Xuebao/Journal of Astronautics, 29, 6, pp. 1729-1732, (2008); Packaging Engineering, (2017); Da Ronch, Andrea, Adaptive design of experiments for efficient and accurate estimation of aerodynamic loads, Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, 89, 4, pp. 558-569, (2017); Deng, Lei, Energy absorption characteristics of a square hole honeycomb sandwich plate under blast loading, Zhendong yu Chongji/Journal of Vibration and Shock, 31, 17, pp. 186-189, (2012); Dong, Yangyang, Mechanical design and energy absorption analysis of spherical honeycomb core for soft-landing device buffer shell, Acta Mechanica, 231, 10, pp. 4243-4257, (2020); Fu, Xiaoyun, Multi-objective shape optimization of autonomous underwater glider based on fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, Ocean Engineering, 157, pp. 339-349, (2018); Han, Huilong, In-plane dynamic impact response characteristics of periodic 4-point star-shaped honeycomb structures, Zhendong yu Chongji/Journal of Vibration and Shock, 36, 23, pp. 223-231, (2017); Sung, Shin-Jang, Quasi-static crush behavior of aluminum honeycomb specimens under compression dominant combined loads, International Journal of Plasticity, 22, 1, pp. 73-109, (2006); Hu, Lingling, Mechanical properties of triangular honeycombs under in-plane impact loading, Zhendong yu Chongji/Journal of Vibration and Shock, 30, 5, pp. 226-235, (2011)",""

The stress-strain outputs are used to calculate the specific energy absorption, efficiency, and ideality metrics for all density-graded structures.

To optimise the crash performance of the structure, i.e. to maximise the SEA and minimise the UPF, a multi-objective particle swarm optimisation was performed.

Recent developments in crash impact energy absorption for crashworthy components include thin wall structures, honeycomb structures, and metallic foam sandwich structures. The honeycomb and metallic foam structures appear to have high specific energy absorption capability. However, both structural configurations have a shortcoming, i.e. honeycomb structures only have the unidirectional capability, while the metallic foam structures have highly irregular (random) three-dimensional cell configuration. The advanced development of additive manufacturing has paved the way for the developments of complicated geometry that will support the development of crashworthy components in the form of lattice structures. The lattice structures provide both three-dimensional and regular structural configurations that are able to absorb crash impact energy efficiently. Therefore, lattice structures have excellent potential to be used for energy management of crash impact structures. Eleven types of lattice configurations were examined to determine the highest specific energy absorption capability, i.e. kagome, tetrahedron, pyramid, cube, truncated-pyramid, octahedron, rhombicuboctahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, open-cell, and octet lattice structures. Numerical analysis and design optimization were performed on a single cell unit of each lattice configuration. It was found that the optimum lattice configuration for crashworthy components was the octet lattice structure. Further topology optimization of the octet lattice configuration resulted in an optimum solution of the octet structure in the form of a twisted octet lattice structure. The twisted lattice structure with 20% relative density was able to generate the highest specific energy absorption. A case study on an aircraft subfloor surface structures showed that the twisted lattice structure was able to absorb aircraft grounding impact energy efficiently. General buckling failure in the twisted lattice structure can be avoided by using a tapered configuration. This tapered lattice structure has a high potential to provide specific energy absorption of up to 127 kJ/kg.

The square honeycomb is formed by the improved crisscrosses. The webs of the crisscross have variable thickness and unequal section length, which make the property of the honeycomb improved. An explicit formulation was deduced for predicting the mean crushing force. A finite element method based numerical analysis model was built to calculate the crashworthiness, and a surrogate model based multi-objective optimisation model was set up for designing the cross-sectional parameters including the thickness and the section lengths of webs. The theoretical prediction results have a good agreement with the numerical results, and the prediction formulation was further modified by the numerical results. The theoretical and numerical results showed the thickness of the crisscross webs greatly affect the crashworthiness. A square honeycomb with high specific energy absorption and low peak crushing force was obtained through optimising the cross-sectional parameters of the honeycomb. The specific energy absorption increases about 70% and the peak crushing force drop over 40% after the optimisation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crashworthiness; Crisscross-improved square honeycomb; design optimisation; out-of-plane crashing; theoretical prediction","Crushing; Energy absorption; Forecasting; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical methods; Reinforcement; Cross sectional parameter; Design optimisation; Explicit formulation; Numerical analysis models; Out-of plane; Specific energy absorption; Square honeycombs; Variable thickness; Crashworthiness","Alghamdi, Abdulmalik A.A., Collapsible impact energy absorbers: An overview, Thin-Walled Structures, 39, 2, pp. 189-213, (2001); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Khan, Muhammad Kashif, Experimental investigation of in-plane and out-of-plane crushing of aluminum honeycomb, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 539, pp. 135-142, (2012); McFarland, R.

The concept is based on the contraction of cellular structures with negative Poisson's ratio under impact, which is combined with the energy absorption capability of a foam filler. An experimental assessment was accomplished considering a 3D-printed polymeric hexa-chiral frame filled with open-cell soft polyurethane foam inserts, subjected to quasi-static and dynamic indentation. The energy absorbed by the combination of the auxetic frame and foam is significantly higher than the sum of the energies absorbed by constituent elements tested separately. Based on the experiments, a numerical approach for foam-filled absorbers is developed and validated. Then non-linear models of metallic chiral units are considered in a genetic optimization process, set up to optimize the maximum frame contraction under compression before its failure. Finally, the previously validated numerical approach is applied to the optimized geometries, and it is shown that the foam filler can provide significant enhancement of specific absorbed energy and load uniformity ratio also for frames made of ductile metallic material. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Auxetic materials; Chiral honeycomb; Energy absorption; Localized impacts; Optimization","3D printers; Fillers; Auxetic behavior; Auxetic materials; Chiral honeycomb; Energy; Energy absorbers; Foam filled; Localised; Localized impact; Numerical approaches; Optimisations; Energy absorption","Lehmhus, Dirk, From stochastic foam to designed structure: Balancing cost and performance of cellular metals, Materials, 10, 8, (2017); Tarlochan, Faris, Advanced composite sandwich structure design for energy absorption applications: Blast protection and crashworthiness, Composites Part B: Engineering, 43, 5, pp. 2198-2208, (2012); Yan, L.

Curved structure can support the external loads effectively by virtue of their spatial curvature. In review of the excellent energy absorption property of auxetic structure, employing auxetic structure as core material in curved sandwich shows the potential to improve the protection performance. In this study, a novel cylindrical sandwich panel with double arrow auxetic (DAA) core was designed and the numerical model was built by ABAQUS. Due to the complexity of the structure, systematic parameter study and optimal design are conducted. Two cases of optimal design were considered, case1 focuses on reducing the deflection and mass of the structure, while case2 focuses on reducing the deflection and increasing the energy absorption per unit mass. Parameter study and optimal design were conducted based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHD) method, artificial neural networks (ANN) metamodel and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ). The Pareto front was obtained and the cylindrical DAA structure performed much better than its equal solid panel in both blast resistance and energy absorption capacity.

The in-plane impact resistances and absorbed-energy characteristics of bio-inspired auxetic RAHs subjected to a constant velocity crushing are numerically studied by using ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. It is shown that due to the introduction of re-entrant arc-shaped structures, the dynamic response curves of bio-inspired RAHs have better crushing load uniformity than conventional re-entrant honeycombs. Except for the relative density and impact velocity, the dynamic crushing behaviors of bio-inspired RAHs also depend upon the cell micro-structure parameters (e.g., the curvature). Based on the one-dimensional (1D) shock theory and absorbed-energy efficiency method, an empirical equation is deduced to evaluate the dynamic plateau stress of bio-inspired RAHs. The finite element (FE) results coincide well with those calculated by the empirical formulas. Moreover, the specific energy absorption (SEA) and energy dissipation rules of bio-inspired RAHs are discussed, which are also dependent on the curvature.

Thus, this paper presents a method that combines radial basis functions with expected improvement to optimize the specific energy absorption of honeycomb cellular materials, while the peak crush force is constrained at low levels for safety reasons. Honeycomb's cell size, cell shape and thickness are the design variables. Concerning the cell shape, the results indicate the hexagonal configuration has a higher out-of-plane performance compared to auxetic and rectangular cells in terms of energy absorption capacity.

However, structural parameters design by traditional optimization algorithm in small design space is not sufficient to significantly enhance the specific energy absorption (SEA) with the lower peak acceleration (a<inf>max</inf>). In this paper, a two-stage hybrid optimization for honeycomb-type cellular parameters is proposed to achieve rapid positioning of design space and significantly increase crashworthiness in a larger variable domain under out-of-plane dynamic impact. In stage I, a Taguchi-based grey correlation discrete optimization, combining Taguchi analysis, grey relational analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with grey entropy measurement, is performed to determine the initial optimal value with a higher robustness and the significant influence variables. In stage II, a multi-objective design technique, namely non-nominated sorting genetic algorithm II based on surrogated model, is adopted to maximize the SEA and minimize the a<inf>max</inf> in a relatively small design domain. And it is found that the proposed two-stage hybrid method can broaden the optimal design space compared to that of traditional method attributable to its center point positioned by stage I. And the final optimization based on the proposed strategy is superior to the original structure, i.e., the SEA is increased by 47.55% and the a<inf>max</inf> is decreased by 80.8%. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can also be used to solve other more complicated engineering problems in a large design space with insightful design data. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Crashworthiness; Honeycomb; Multi-objective optimization; Response surface methodology; Taguchi-based grey relational analysis","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Crashworthiness; Genetic algorithms; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Shape optimization; Discrete optimization; Grey relational analysis; Honeycomb; Multi-objective design; Optimization algorithms; Response surface methodology; Sorting genetic algorithm; Specific energy absorption; Structural design","Farooq, Umar, Interfacial Mechanical Performance of Composite Honeycomb Sandwich Panels for Aerospace Applications, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 42, 5, pp. 1775-1782, (2017); J Undergrad Eng Res, (2018); Ganilova, Olga A., Application of smart honeycomb structures for automotive passive safety, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 232, 6, pp. 797-811, (2018); Korde, Jay M., Bionic prototyping of honeycomb patterned polymer composite and its engineering application, Polymer - Plastics Technology and Engineering, 57, 17, pp. 1828-1844, (2018); Zhao, Han, Crushing behaviour of aluminium honeycombs under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 10, pp. 827-836, (1998); Sung, Shin-Jang, Quasi-static crush behavior of aluminum honeycomb specimens under compression dominant combined loads, International Journal of Plasticity, 22, 1, pp. 73-109, (2006); Hong, Sungtae, Dynamic crush behaviors of aluminum honeycomb specimens under compression dominant inclined loads, International Journal of Plasticity, 24, 1, pp. 89-117, (2008); Deqiang, Sun, Mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses of hexagonal honeycomb cores under impact loadings, Composite Structures, 92, 11, pp. 2609-2621, (2010); Nakamoto, Hiroaki, In-plane impact behavior of honeycomb structures randomly filled with rigid inclusions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 73-80, (2009); Nakamoto, Hiroaki, In-plane impact behavior of honeycomb structures filled with linearly arranged inclusions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 8, pp. 1019-1026, (2009)",""

To further investigate the potential of honeycomb-filled composite structures, an innovative self-similar graded honeycomb-filled thin-walled structure is proposed in this paper. First, the numerical model of the self-similar graded honeycomb-filled circular tube (SGHCT) is established in ABAQUS and then is validated via the existing experiment. To systematically study the bending behavior of this novel structure, eight kinds of SGHCT with different graded patterns are designed and compared with uniform honeycomb-filled circular tube (UHCT). Through parametric study, we find that the novel structure exhibits better energy absorption characteristics than the corresponding UHCT. In addition, various parameters like thickness, mass ratio and yield stress of column wall have a considerable effect on the crashworthiness performance of this innovative structure. Furthermore, the bending behaviors of effective SGHCT are also investigated to increase the weight efficiency. Finally, the SGHT and UHCT are optimized by adopting the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Kriging modeling technique. The optimization results show that the SGHCTs show superior Pareto solutions to the uniform honeycomb-filled tubes, also better crashworthiness than foam-filled tubes under high PCF conditions in the previous researches. Especially, the specific energy absorption of ascending single-direction self-similar tube increases from 1.17 kJ/kg to 1.74 kJ/kg by 48.9%. The findings of this study offer a new route of designing novel crashworthiness structure with high energy absorption capacity. © 2019","Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Graded honeycomb; Multi-objective optimization; Self-similar","Composite structures; Energy absorption; Genetic algorithms; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Thin walled structures; Tubes (components); Yield stress; Absorption characteristics; Crashworthiness designs; Graded honeycomb; High-energy absorption; Innovative structures; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Self-similar; Specific energy absorption; Crashworthiness","Alghamdi, Abdulmalik A.A., Collapsible impact energy absorbers: An overview, Thin-Walled Structures, 39, 2, pp. 189-213, (2001); Baroutaji, Ahmad, On the crashworthiness performance of thin-walled energy absorbers: Recent advances and future developments, Thin-Walled Structures, 118, pp. 137-163, (2017); Zhang, Xiong, Energy absorption of multi-cell stub columns under axial compression, Thin-Walled Structures, 68, pp. 156-163, (2013); Zhang, Xiong, Theoretical prediction and numerical simulation of multi-cell square thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 44, 11, pp. 1185-1191, (2006); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Zhang, Xiong, Theoretical and numerical investigation on the crush resistance of rhombic and kagome honeycombs, Composite Structures, 96, pp. 143-152, (2013); Liu, Longquan, Experimental and numerical study on the mechanical response of Nomex honeycomb core under transverse loading, Composite Structures, 121, pp. 304-314, (2015); Xiong, Jian, Bending behavior of lightweight sandwich-walled shells with pyramidal truss cores, Composite Structures, 116, 1, pp. 793-804, (2014); Liu, Jiayi, Experimental study on the low velocity impact responses of all-composite pyramidal truss core sandwich panel after high temperature exposure, Composite Structures, 116, 1, pp. 670-681, (2014); Zhang, Yong, Crushing analysis for novel bio-inspired hierarchical circular structures subjected to axial load, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 140, pp. 407-431, (2018)",""

This study aimed to address these issues by investigating uniform and graded foam core configurations. First, an experimental study was performed and the testing results of blast-loaded sandwich panels were analyzed. Second, a numerical model was developed and validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental results in terms of deformation modes and back facesheet deflection. Third, the blast resistance of sandwich panels was comprehensively studied based upon the developed numerical models. Due to the high attenuation ability of the shock induced stress wave, the foam core with descending gradient of layer density across the thickness direction provided the highest blast resistance of all the core configurations considered here and its advantage could be further improved by enlarging the density difference of the core layer. While keeping total facesheet thickness unchanged, a relatively thick back facesheet is beneficial to enhance the blast resistance under relative low blast intensity. Finally, an optimization study was performed to improve the blast resistance of graded core sandwich panels. For the single objective optimization, the maximum back facesheet deflection of the optimum design decreased by 24.58% in comparison with that for the initial baseline design. For the multiobjective optimization, the optimal designs obtained from the Pareto solution can significantly enhance weight efficiency without compromising the resistance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blast resistance; Design optimization; Functionally-graded foam core; Sandwich panels; Shock stress wave","Deformation; Elastic waves; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Computational analysis; Design optimization; Foam core; Functional characteristics; Optimization studies; Sandwich panel; Shock stress; Single objective optimization; Blast resistance","Ye, Nan, Dynamic response and failure of sandwich plates with PVC foam core subjected to impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 109, pp. 121-130, (2017); Xue, Zhenyu, A comparative study of impulse-resistant metal sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 30, 10, pp. 1283-1305, (2004); Liang, Xiaolong, Experimental study on stress attenuation in aluminum foam core sandwich panels in high-velocity impact, Materials Letters, 203, pp. 100-102, (2017); Xu, Alan, Finite element analysis of indentation of aluminium foam and sandwich panels with aluminium foam core, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 599, pp. 125-133, (2014); Jing, Lin, Perforation resistance of sandwich panels with layered gradient metallic foam cores, Composite Structures, 171, pp. 217-226, (2017); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical studies on indentation and perforation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 110-124, (2018); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical study on honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and in-panel compression, Materials and Design, 133, pp. 154-168, (2017); Sun, Guangyong, High-velocity impact behaviour of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels with different structural configurations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 122, pp. 119-136, (2018); Cui, Liang, Designing the energy absorption capacity of functionally graded foam materials, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 507, 1-2, pp. 215-225, (2009); Sun, Guangyong, Low-velocity impact behaviour of sandwich panels with homogeneous and stepwise graded foam cores, Materials and Design, 160, pp. 1117-1136, (2018)",""

Unlike other traditional honeycombs and lattice structures, sheet-based cellular structures consist of triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) cores, which are continuous through space with a porous cavity surrounded by continuous surfaces. In this study, the crashworthiness of four types of TPMS sheet structures (i.e., Primitive, FRD, IWP, and Gyroid) under axial loading was investigated. According to the results obtained by the nonlinear finite element analysis, the level-constant in the implicit form of TPMS and the shell thickness of TPMS sheet structures were found to affect the crashworthiness significantly. To achieve an optimal design, a metamodel-based multi-objective optimization method was developed to optimize the four types of TPMS sheet structures. Three different metamodels, i.e., Kriging (KRG), polynomial response surface (PRS) and radial basis function (RBF), were compared to identify the most accurate model, which was then utilized for the optimization. Followed by the multiobjective optimization, four Pareto fronts of these TPMS sheet structures were plotted and compared, of which the FRD-sheet structure was found to have the best energy absorption capacity. Moreover, the crashworthiness of the TPMS sheet structures was compared with that of the other materials or structures in nature and engineering, and an Ashby plot was given. Overall, TPMS sheet structures possess excellent specific energy absorption and specific strength and show great potential for engineering applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness optimization; Energy absorption; Finite element analysis; Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)","Cellular automata; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Multiobjective optimization; Radial basis function networks; Continuous surface; Crashworthiness optimization; Energy absorption capacity; Engineering applications; Non-linear finite-element analysis; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Specific energy absorption; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Shape optimization","Evans, Anthony G., The topological design of multifunctional cellular metals, Progress in Materials Science, 46, 3-4, pp. 309-327, (2001); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Xu, Shanqing, Design of lattice structures with controlled anisotropy, Materials and Design, 93, pp. 443-447, (2016); Huo, Xintao, Experimental study on low-velocity impact responses and residual properties of composite sandwiches with metallic foam core, Composite Structures, 223, (2019); Boomsma, Kevin, Metal foams as compact high performance heat exchangers, Mechanics of Materials, 35, 12, pp. 1161-1176, (2003); Liu, Jie, On sound insulation of pyramidal lattice sandwich structure, Composite Structures, 208, pp. 385-394, (2019); Yin, Hanfeng, Multi-objective robust optimization of foam-filled bionic thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 109, pp. 332-343, (2016); Yin, Hanfeng, Multiobjective optimization for foam-filled multi-cell thin-walled structures under lateral impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 94, pp. 1-12, (2015); Yoo, Dongjin, New paradigms in cellular material design and fabrication, International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing, 16, 12, pp. 2577-2589, (2015); Zhao, Li, Bionic design and 3D printing of porous titanium alloy scaffolds for bone tissue repair, Composites Part B: Engineering, 162, pp. 154-161, (2019)",""

The shock wave affecting the structure is generated by detonation of the C4 charge in an explosive-driven shock tube (EDST). The EDST set-up is an instrumented device that makes it possible to study blast effects in more stable and repeatable conditions than those obtained in a free-air detonation. The formation of folds characteristic of a honeycomb deformation in the axial compression distributes the initial loading over a time period, which is considered as an efficient method of energy dissipation. The test configuration is modeled in the Ls-Dyna explicit code, which enables analysis of the mechanisms of energy absorption that accompanies structural deformation under a blast loading. The conclusions reached in the performed experimental and numerical investigation can be applied to the modeling and optimization of cellular structures used to mitigate blast loadings. © 2019 by the authors.

The following results were determined. (1) The method of increasing A to reduce the peak force of the BEP crash box is effective, whereas the latter method is invalid. (2) The latter method is invalid because the unit structure (the BEP crash box) is different from the multivariate structure (the BEP) used to determine the prediction due to the change of constraint condition on the trabeculae provided by the honeycomb walls. (3) An optimum A of 1.0 is proposed for BEP crash boxes with better energy absorption abilities and more stable successively laminated deformation. Specifically, the main peak force of the BEP crash box is approximately the same as that of the conventional one, while the structural energy absorption (SEA) and load uniformity (LU) of BEP crash boxes are at least 3 times and between only one-third and one-fourth those of conventional crash box, respectively, meaning that BEP crash boxes can be directly used to replace conventional one and to significantly improve security. Thus, these results provide an experimental basis for further research on BEP crash boxes. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","beetle elytra; biomimetic design; compression; crash box; energy absorbing; thin-walled structure","Biomimetic processes; Compaction; Deformation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Thin walled structures; beetle elytra; Biomimetic design; Crash box; energy absorbing; Energy absorption ability; Energy absorption capability; Experimental verification; Optimization researches; Plates (structural components)","Appl Mech Mater, (2016); Zhou, Xiaosong, Low-velocity impact response and energy dissipation mechanism of composite multilayer array structures – Experimental and finite element analysis, Composite Structures, 197, pp. 89-105, (2018); Wu, Kaijin, Interfacial strength-controlled energy dissipation mechanism and optimization in impact-resistant nacreous structure, Materials and Design, 163, (2019); Structural Impact, (1989); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Axial crushing of multicorner sheet metal columns, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 56, 1, pp. 113-120, (1989); Wierzbicki, Tomasz, On the crushing mechanics of thi-n-walled structures, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 50, 4, pp. 727-734, (1983); Nurick, Gerald N., The response of plates subjected to loading arising from the detonation of different shapes of plastic explosive, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 89, pp. 102-113, (2016); Kristoffersen, Martin, Combined three-point bending and axial tension of pressurised and unpressurised X65 offshore steel pipes – Experiments and simulations, Marine Structures, 61, pp. 560-577, (2018); Markiewicz, Eric, An inverse approach to determine the constitutive model parameters from axial crushing of thin-walled square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 6, pp. 433-449, (1998); Eyvazian, Arameh, Axial crushing behavior and energy absorption efficiency of corrugated tubes, Materials and Design, 54, pp. 1028-1038, (2014)",""

In this paper, a novel bio-inspired graded honeycomb-filled circular tube (BGHCT) is proposed to enhance structural energy absorption characteristics under lateral load. The graded honeycomb fillers are constructed using 3D printing techniques. To systematically explore the crashworthiness of BGHCT, the nonlinear finite element models are first developed in Abaqus (explicit) and validated against the experiments. Then graded honeycomb-filled circular tubes with axial and radial graded directions are compared with uniform honeycomb-filled counterparts (UHT). Parametric studies find that BGHCT exhibits superior capacity of energy absorption. Furthermore, various parameters, like effective filling length, thickness and yield stress of column wall, have a considerable effect on the crashworthiness of this novel structure. Lastly, multi-objective optimizations of BGHCT and UHT are carried out with the aim of simultaneously improving specific energy absorption (SEA) and reducing peak crushing force (PCF), based upon the Kriging modeling technique and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimal design parameters are obtained for these honeycomb-filled structures. By comparison we find that energy absorption characteristics can be increased by up to 89.73%, and effective length filled structure has the best crashworthiness, followed by full graded honeycomb-filled structure. The study provides new insights into the transformation of natural biological inspiration into engineering applications for crashworthiness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness; Effective honeycomb filled; Energy absorption; Graded honeycomb; Multi-objective optimization","3D printers; ABAQUS; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Fillers; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Structural design; Yield stress; Absorption characteristics; Effective honeycomb filled; Functionally graded structure; Graded honeycomb; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Non-linear finite element model; Optimal design parameters; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Zhang, Yong, Crushing analysis for novel bio-inspired hierarchical circular structures subjected to axial load, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 140, pp. 407-431, (2018); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Dynamic progressive buckling of circular and square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 4, 4, pp. 243-270, (1986); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Dynamic axial crushing of circular tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 2, 3, pp. 263-281, (1984); Al Galib, D., Experimental and numerical investigation of static and dynamic axial crushing of circular aluminum tubes, Thin-Walled Structures, 42, 8, pp. 1103-1137, (2004); Zhang, Xiong, Energy absorption of multi-cell stub columns under axial compression, Thin-Walled Structures, 68, pp. 156-163, (2013); Zhang, Xiong, Theoretical prediction and numerical simulation of multi-cell square thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 44, 11, pp. 1185-1191, (2006); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Alavi, Ali, Comparative analysis of energy absorption capacity of simple and multi-cell thin-walled tubes with triangular, square, hexagonal and octagonal sections, Thin-Walled Structures, 74, pp. 155-165, (2014); Hou, Shujuan, Design optimization of regular hexagonal thin-walled columns with crashworthiness criteria, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 43, 6-7, pp. 555-565, (2007); Alexander, J.

Present study proposes a sandwich panel based on expanding-folding absorber units to evaluate their crush mechanism.

Inner re-entrant triangles are employed to satisfy energy absorption, and outer thin wall is used to acquire high stiffness. This paper starts from establishment of theoretical models between geometric parameters of re-entrant triangles and relative density, equivalent elastic modulus and energy absorption characteristics, which are validated by experiments. On this basis, the optimal geometric parameters of unit cell are sought to maximize unit volume energy absorption and minimize relative density by adopting NSGA-II method. Subsequently, the cross-section of tube with optimal stiffness is obtained with targets for maximizing axial stiffness and lateral stiffness by employing static topology optimization method. To verify the proposed optimization method, RTT is analyzed and compared with positive Poisson’s ratio foam-filled tube (PFT), non-filled traditionally optimized tube (NTT) and pre-optimized square tube (PST). The results show that the novel RTT can improve stiffness and energy absorption performance simultaneously. Compared with the positive Poisson’s ratio material, re-entrant triangles honeycomb shows superior advantages in energy absorption. In comparison with the PFT, energy absorption of the RTT increases by 17.23%, and the peak crush force reduces by 5.04%. Therefore, the proposed decoupling design method demonstrates superiority in satisfying various performance requirements simultaneously. © 2019, The Author(s).","Energy absorption; Multi-objective optimization; Re-entrant triangles honeycomb; Structural stiffness; Thin-walled tube","Crashworthiness; Design; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Stiffness; Thin walled structures; Tubes (components); Crashworthiness optimization; Decouplings; Foam-filled tubes; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization design; Re-entrant triangle honeycomb; Relative density; S ratio; Structural stiffness; Thin walled tubes; Multiobjective optimization","Miller, W.

In this study, a functionally graded thickness (FGT) design method is introduced in the design of a hexagon honeycomb structure to improve energy absorbing efficiency on the basis of a traditional honeycomb with uniform thickness (UT). The validation of a numerical analysis model for a UT honeycomb under axial loading is implemented by a nonlinear finite element code LS-DYNA (V971). Furthermore, the multiobjective crashworthiness optimization of an FGT honeycomb subjected to axial quasi-static compression is conducted to maximize specific energy absorption (SEA) and minimize peak crashing force (PCF). In addition, three surrogate models, including radial basis function (RBF), response surface method (RSM), and kriging (KRG), are compared in the accuracy of predicting SEA and PCF and capacity for optimization design of FGT honeycomb structure; the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions for the maximum thickness, minimum thickness, and thickness variation gradient exponent of a honeycomb wall. The optimal points obtained by different surrogate models subjected to an SEA value of 18.5 kJ/kg, 20 kJ/kg, 22 kJ/kg, and 24 kJ/kg are validated, and corresponding optimal parameters are compared; RBF and RSM are more suitable in crashworthiness optimization design of the FGT honeycomb structure.

Then the multi-objective optimization of core cell shape with optimal sandwich panel size was optimized by maximizing SEA and minimizing the peak force, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA-II) code was used to perform the optimization process in a gradual evolution trend, which led to obtain the Pareto front that consisted of a set of optimal objective function vectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Corrugated sandwich panels; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Optimization; Specific energy absorption","Accidents; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Energy absorption; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Optimization; Sandwich structures; Absorption characteristics; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Numerical calculation; Optimization studies; Quasi-static compression; Response surface method; Sandwich panel; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Zok, Frank W., A protocol for characterizing the structural performance of metallic sandwich panels: Application to pyramidal truss cores, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 41, 22-23, pp. 6249-6271, (2004); Tian, Y.

Impact tests were performed in a velocity range from about 70 to 170 m/s to investigate the effects of facesheet thickness, core height, cell wall thickness and cell size of honeycomb on the impact behaviour of sandwich panels. These geometric parameters were found to influence the impact performance mainly by changing the deformation and failure mechanisms of both sandwich facesheets. Moreover, the ballistic limit velocity and critical perforation energy of each sandwich configuration were obtained by numerical simulation. It was found that increasing facesheet thickness and reducing honeycomb cell size were two weight-efficient ways to enhance the perforation resistance of sandwich panels when the areal density exceeded a certain value. The projectile's penetration process into the sandwich panel and the associated energy absorbing mechanisms were analysed, the results of which showed that facesheets contributed most to energy absorption. Further numerical simulation was conducted to explore the influences of core stiffness and the thickness ratio of front to back facesheet. It was found that core stiffness had a significant effect on the deformation and failure initiation of front facesheet; more specifically, the front facesheet failed more easily due to stress concentration with the increase of core stiffness. When the total thickness of front and back facesheets remained constant, increasing the front-to-back thickness ratio led to higher damage resistance but greater deformation area on the front facesheet. Finally, a discrete optimisation was conducted to generate an optimal design of sandwich structure for achieving the highest specific energy absorption without perforation under a certain impact energy. The optimised sandwich panel exhibited an increase of 23.7% in specific energy absorption compared with the initial design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete optimisation; Failure mechanism; Impact behaviour; Projectile penetration; Sandwich panel","Aluminum; Deformation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Numerical models; Optimization; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Structural panels; Velocity; Discrete optimisation; Failure mechanism; Impact behaviour; Projectile penetration; Sandwich panel; Failure (mechanical)","Wu, Yinghan, Dynamic crash responses of bio-inspired aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 121, pp. 122-133, (2017); Khan, Laraib Alam, Cost-effective manufacturing process for the development of automotive from energy efficient composite materials and sandwich structures, Polymer Composites, 35, 1, pp. 97-104, (2014); Balcı, Onur, Experimental investigation of single and repeated impacts for repaired honeycomb sandwich structures, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 682, pp. 23-30, (2017); Caserta, Gaetano D., Shock absorption performance of a motorbike helmet with honeycomb reinforced liner, Composite Structures, 93, 11, pp. 2748-2759, (2011); Chai, Gin Boay, A review of low-velocity impact on sandwich structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 225, 4, pp. 207-230, (2011); Zhang, Dahai, Drop-weight impact behavior of honeycomb sandwich panels under a spherical impactor, Composite Structures, 168, pp. 633-645, (2017); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical studies on indentation and perforation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 110-124, (2018); Shen, Yiou, Geometrical effects in the impact response of the aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 33, 12, pp. 1148-1157, (2014); Crupi, Vincenzo, Collapse modes in aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 6-15, (2012); Wen, H.

On this basis, the effectiveness of the composite structure and aluminium honeycomb finite element model (FEM) is validated by conducting trolley impact tests and quasi-static compression experiments. Based on the verified FEM, the surrogate models, including polynomial response surface (PRS), Kriging, radial basis function (RBF) and supported vector regression (SVR), are established to get the relationship between crashworthiness indexes and design variables. Then, the most accurate model is employed for crashworthiness optimisation through comparing the accuracies of these four models. Owing to the mutually effects among components of the composite EAS and the relatively complex mathematical formulae acquired by the high-precision surrogate model, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation (HPSO) algorithm is put forward. The performance of the HPSO is tested by a typical engineering optimisation case. The results indicate that the HPSO algorithm presents various advantages (e.g. strong global search capability, high optimisation accuracy, etc.). By optimising the mathematical model of the composite EAS, the optimal configurations of the structure are obtained, which confirms that the HPSO algorithm has favourable applicability and performance in the crashworthiness optimisation of the EASs for subway vehicles. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Composite energy-absorbing structure; Global search; Hybrid particle swarm optimisation; Impact test; Surrogate model","Accidents; Aluminum; Energy absorption; Fuel additives; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Railroads; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Thin walled structures; Composite energy; Global search; Global search capability; Hybrid particles; Mathematical formulas; Quasi-static compression experiment; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Surrogate model; Crashworthiness","Alavi, Ali, Effects of buckling initiators on mechanical behavior of thin-walled square tubes subjected to oblique loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 59, pp. 87-96, (2012); Alavi, Ali, An investigation on the energy absorption characteristics of multi-cell square tubes, Thin-Walled Structures, 68, pp. 26-34, (2013); Arasomwan, Akugbe Martins, On the performance of linear decreasing inertia weight particle swarm optimization for global optimization, Scientific World Journal, 2013, (2013); Baroutaji, Ahmad, Crush analysis and multi-objective optimization design for circular tube under quasi-static lateral loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 86, pp. 121-131, (2015); Chen, Siji, A novel multi-cell tubal structure with circular corners for crashworthiness, Thin-Walled Structures, 122, pp. 329-343, (2018); Chen, Yafeng, Crashworthiness analysis of octagonal multi-cell tube with functionally graded thickness under multiple loading angles, Thin-Walled Structures, 110, pp. 133-139, (2017); Clarke, Stella M., Analysis of support vector regression for approximation of complex engineering analyses, Journal of Mechanical Design, 127, 6, pp. 1077-1087, (2005); Coello, Carlos A., Constraint-handling in genetic algorithms through the use of dominance-based tournament selection, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 16, 3, pp. 193-203, (2002); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Optimization of foam-filled double circular tubes under axial and oblique impact loading conditions, Thin-Walled Structures, 87, pp. 1-11, (2015); Duddeck, Fabian M.E., Topology optimization for crashworthiness of thin-walled structures under axial impact using hybrid cellular automata, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 54, 3, pp. 415-428, (2016)",""

To further investigate the potential of honeycomb-filled thin-walled structures, this paper proposed a novel functionally graded honeycomb (FGH) as filler. First, the finite element model of the functionally graded honeycomb-filled tube (FGHT) is established and validated via experimental results. Then, the key factors of FGHT for crashworthiness are identified. The results show that gradient pattern is critical to the crushing response. As for the overall energy absorption capability, we thoroughly examined the effects of gradient exponent n and the thickness range of honeycomb shells. Next, we conducted single and multi-objective optimisation, adopting genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), to seek the parameters that deliver overall crashworthiness performance. The Kriging surrogate metamodel was established to formulate specific energy absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) in relation to the key parameters. The single objective optimisation revealed that, provided the same PCF, the SEA of FGHT is always higher than uniform honeycomb filled tube (UHFT); the Pareto front obtained from multi-objective optimisation also indicate that FGHT is generally more efficient than UHFT.

It is a big issue to balance the protective performance and lightweight property of military vehicle. In these days, many types of sandwich panels with different cores were applied as protective plates in military vehicles. In view of the excellent energy absorption capability of auxetic structure, applying auxetic structure as sandwich panel core for blast protection purpose is a promising field. However, existing in-plane configuration of two-dimensional auxetic honeycomb core always represent anisotropic behaviour. In this paper, a novel sandwich panel with three-dimensional double-V Auxetic (DVA) structure core, which can produce isotropic mechanical behavior, was proposed for air blast protection purpose. Its primary structural parameters and their relations were discussed, and a parametric numerical model was established. In order to reduce both the dynamic response under air blast loading and mass, the design variables and objective function of the DVA core optimization problem were confirmed, then parametric optimization was conducted based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHD) method, Gaussian process metamodel (GPM) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). Finally, it is proved that the applied optimization process is efficient and can obtain accurate optimum points. The proposed DAV core sandwich panel performed much better both in lightweight and protection than solid plate and has an apparent merit in lightweight aspect compared with square honeycomb core sandwich panel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air blast loading; Auxetic; Double-V; Negative Poisson's ratio; Sandwich panel; Structural optimization","Honeycomb structures; Military vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Shock waves; Air blast; Auxetic; Double v; Negative poisson's ratios; Sandwich panel; Structural optimization","Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Li, Xin, Dynamic behavior of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels under air blast: Experiment and numerical analysis, Composite Structures, 108, 1, pp. 1001-1008, (2014); Ahmed, Sameh, Effectiveness of FRP sandwich panels for blast resistance, Composite Structures, 163, pp. 454-464, (2017); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Response of metallic pyramidal lattice core sandwich panels to high intensity impulsive loading in air, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 38, 5, pp. 275-289, (2011); Dharmasena, Kumar P., The dynamic response of edge clamped plates loaded by spherically expanding sand shells, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 62, pp. 182-195, (2013); Liu, Xinrang, Sandwich plates with functionally graded metallic foam cores subjected to air blast loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 84, pp. 61-72, (2014); Yang, Li, Mechanical properties of 3D re-entrant honeycomb auxetic structures realized via additive manufacturing, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 69-70, pp. 475-490, (2015); Xiong, Jiapeng, Structural optimization of re-entrant negative Poisson's ratio structure fabricated by selective laser melting, Materials and Design, 120, pp. 307-316, (2017); Wang, Xintao, Mechanical properties of 3D re-entrant auxetic cellular structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 131-132, pp. 396-407, (2017); Zhang, Wei, Mechanical properties of a cellular vehicle body structure with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced strength, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 33, 4, pp. 342-349, (2014)",""

Non-linear explicit code LS_DYNA3D(971) was utilized in building detailed finite element models, which were also validated by previous test data. Considering the expensive selling price, complicated fabricating technology and low production rate of high strength honeycomb, honeycombs with appropriate strength should be selected to fill in the steel structure. Therefore, scientific sampling points were chosen from the design space using Box-Behnken design method. Analysis of variance was performed in order to explore the effects of distributed honeycomb strength in four levels on crashworthiness indicators. Response surface methodology (RSM) was well applied to perform both parametric analysis and multiobjective optimization for searching the optimal configurations. Here, two different criterion were conducted in optimization process by adopting desirability approach. It was find that the composite structure with high strength honeycombs in level-1 and level-2 and relatively low strength honeycombs in level-3 and level-4 are preferable for use. Comparing with the empty steel structure, the optimal EA capacity is promoted by 35.32% in criterion 1 and 34.35% in criterion 2, being able to bear the condition with crashing speed of 36 km/h and impacting mass of 55.3 t.

Samples with different cellular core designs were fabricated by laser sintering additive manufacturing process using Nylon 12 as material, and evaluated by drop weight testing under multiple strikes and at two levels of elevated temperatures (93 °C and 121 °C). It was found that beside relative densities, the geometrical design of the cellular cores could also significantly influence the impact energy absorption performance of the sandwich structures. It was also found that the impact energy absorption of the cellular structures investigated in this study does not have a significant correlation with either the quasi-static mechanical properties or the temperature. In addition, the auxetic cellular structure exhibits optimal overall energy absorption performance compared to both the octet-truss and the BCC lattice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Cellular structure; Drop-weight impact; Energy absorption; Sandwich panel","3D printers; Additives; Cellular automata; Crystal structure; Drops; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Laser heating; Laser materials processing; Manufacture; Sandwich structures; Sintering; Structural optimization; Trusses; Absorption performance; Cellular structure; Drop weight impact; Drop-weight testing; Elevated temperature; Geometrical designs; Impact energy absorption; Sandwich panel; Cellular manufacturing","Karlsson, Kicki F., Manufacturing and applications of structural sandwich components, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 28, 2, pp. 97-111, (1997); Huber, O., Cellular composites in lightweight sandwich applications, Materials Letters, 63, 13-14, pp. 1117-1120, (2009); Design of Sandwich Structures, (1998); Wadley, Hayden N.G., Fabrication and structural performance of periodic cellular metal sandwich structures, Composites Science and Technology, 63, 16, pp. 2331-2343, (2003); Suwanna, Pimsiree, The compressive and shear response of titanium matrix composite lattice structures, Acta Materialia, 58, 8, pp. 2822-2835, (2010); Banhart, John, Aluminium foam sandwich panels: Manufacture, metallurgy and applications, Advanced Engineering Materials, 10, 9, pp. 793-802, (2008); Sandwich Structures 7 Advancing with Sandwich Structures and Materials, (2005); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Zok, Frank W., Design of metallic textile core sandwich panels, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 40, 21, pp. 5707-5722, (2003); Army Research Office Program in Advanced Construction Technology, (1988)",""

The effect of these structural parameters on the response characteristics like energy absorption, impact force and honeycomb core density are determined individually by using statistical analysis based on Taguchi’s DOE. But this conventional Taguchi method deals with optimization problems only with a single response at a time. Since the sandwich structure is involved with many response parameters, the Taguchi method alone cannot be useful to obtain optimal process parameters. In the present work, an attempt has been made to derive optimal combination of structural parameters in a honeycomb core sandwich structure using grey relational analysis along with the Taguchi method. Also by using analysis of variance the significant structural parameters were determined. Results show that the most influencing structural parameters considering multiple response characteristics are cell wall thickness followed by cell size. The core height has the very least/negligible effect compared to cell size and cell wall thickness. The optimum combination of the input parameters was found using Taguchi-grey relational analysis. These findings were confirmed with the results of statistical analysis by plotting the main effect plots and Anova results. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Grey relational; Sandwich structure; Structural parameters and impact test; Taguchi","Cells; Cytology; Honeycomb structures; Optimization; Sandwich structures; Statistical methods; Structural analysis; Taguchi methods; Aluminum honeycomb cores; Grey relational; Grey relational analysis; Low velocity impact test; Multiple response characteristics; Multiresponse optimization; Structural parameter; Taguchi grey relational analysis; Structural optimization","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Manufacturing, (1997); Crupi, Vincenzo, Comparison of aluminium sandwiches for lightweight ship structures: Honeycomb vs. foam, Marine Structures, 30, pp. 74-96, (2013); Banhart, John, Manufacture, characterisation and application of cellular metals and metal foams, Progress in Materials Science, 46, 6, pp. 559-632, (2001); Yamashita, Minoru, Impact behavior of honeycomb structures with various cell specifications - Numerical simulation and experiment, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 618-630, (2005); Petrone, Giuseppe, Behaviour of fibre-reinforced honeycomb core under low velocity impact loading, Composite Structures, 100, pp. 356-362, (2013); Thangaraj, Muthuramalingam, Application of Taguchi-grey multi responses optimization on process parameters in electro erosion, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 58, pp. 495-502, (2014); Siddhi Jailani, H., Multi-response optimisation of sintering parameters of Al-Si alloy/fly ash composite using Taguchi method and grey relational analysis, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 45, 3-4, pp. 362-369, (2009); Haq, A.

In this paper, a series of novel bio-inspired aluminum honeycombs consisting of horseshoe mesostructure have been proposed on the basis of triangular honeycomb, square honeycomb, hexagonal honeycomb and kagome honeycomb to improve the energy absorption capacity. The three-dimensional finite element models of the bio-inspired horseshoe-shaped aluminum honeycombs are developed in order to explore the mechanical behaviors under the out-of-plane uniform compression. The simulation results are validated based on the compression experiments of regular hexagonal honeycombs. Besides, parametric investigations are carried out to understand the influences of the wave amplitude, wave number and cell-wall thickness on the out-of-plane crashworthiness. The numerical results demonstrate that adding the horseshoe mesostructure to the regular honeycombs can increase the plateau force greatly compared with the traditional honeycomb structure, leading to the higher specific energy absorption although increasing the initial peak force as well. Finally, a multi-objective optimization is carried out to seek for the optimal honeycombs with the maximum specific energy absorption together with the minimum initial peak force simultaneously. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-inspired; Energy absorption; Honeycomb; Horseshoe mesostructure; Multi-objective optimization","Accidents; Aluminum; Biological materials; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Multiobjective optimization; Bio-inspired; Energy absorption capacity; Honeycomb; Material property charts; Mesostructures; Parametric investigations; Specific energy absorption; Three dimensional finite element model; Honeycomb structures","Meyers, Marc André, Biological materials: Structure and mechanical properties, Progress in Materials Science, 53, 1, pp. 1-206, (2008); Meyers, Marc André, Structural biological materials: Critical mechanics-materials connections, Science, 339, 6121, pp. 773-779, (2013); Zou, Meng, A bionic method for the crashworthiness design of thin-walled structures inspired by bamboo, Thin-Walled Structures, 101, pp. 222-230, (2016); Aizenberg, Joanna, Materials science: Skeleton of euplectella sp.: Structural hierarchy from the nanoscale to the macroscale, Science, 309, 5732, pp. 275-278, (2005); Liu, Kesong, Bio-inspired design of multiscale structures for function integration, Nano Today, 6, 2, pp. 155-175, (2011); Zhang, Linwei, Crashworthiness design for bio-inspired multi-cell tubes with quadrilateral, hexagonal and octagonal sections, Thin-Walled Structures, 122, pp. 42-51, (2018); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Paz Méndez, Javier, Size and shape optimization of aluminum tubes with GFRP honeycomb reinforcements for crashworthy aircraft structures, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 499-507, (2015); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Dynamic compression of metallic sandwich structures during planar impulsive loading in water, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 29, 1, pp. 56-67, (2010)",""

Based on the validated FE model, the collision performances under a vertical offset of 0–80 mm and a horizontal offset of 0–40 mm are studied via simulation. The results show that the original structure is prone to instability when the horizontal offset is greater than 30 mm, so it is necessary to perform an optimization.

This paper aims to explore the merits of various filling fashions on the crashworthiness of multi-cell square structures, namely honeycomb filling, foam filling and compound filling of honeycomb and foam. First, finite element models of different filling structures are validated by the theoretical model. Then, the numerical analysis is carried out using nonlinear finite element code LS-DYNA. The results reveal that partially filling the corner cells of the multi-cell square tube using honeycombs (H40) yields best crashworthiness performance. While for foam filling, filling two diagonally opposed corner cells (F20) produces the best results. Finally, the compound filling schemes were implemented, and found that filling the corner cells with honeycombs, and the central cell with foams (H40F01) generates promising crashworthiness performance. Finally, multi-objective particle swarm optimisation algorithm is adopted to maximise the specific energy absorption and minimise peak crushing force of the three novel structures. The results show that partially filling the four corner cells with honeycombs (H40) yields the most desirable crashworthiness performance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cellular materials; compound filling; crashworthiness; optimisation","Cells; Crashworthiness; Cytology; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Thin walled structures; Cellular material; Compound filling; Nonlinear Finite Element code LS-DYNA; Novel structures; Optimisations; Particle swarm optimisation algorithms; Specific energy absorption; Theoretical modeling; Filling","Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Dynamic axial crushing of square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 2, 2, pp. 179-208, (1984); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Axial crushing of multicorner sheet metal columns, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 56, 1, pp. 113-120, (1989); Acar, Erdem, Multi-objective crashworthiness optimization of tapered thin-walled tubes with axisymmetric indentations, Thin-Walled Structures, 49, 1, pp. 94-105, (2011); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Alexander, J.

To explore the crushing behaviors of honeycomb sandwiches, both three-point bending (TPB) and in-panel compression (IPC) tests were performed on aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels in this study. The effects of several key structural parameters on crashworthiness characteristics and collapse mechanism were first explored through the experiments here. The experimental results divulged that crashworthiness and collapse mode of sandwich structures were greatly influenced by the structural parameters under the TPB test. The crash behaviors can be also affected by both structural and adhesive parameters in the IPC test. Through validating with the experimental data, the numerical models were established to capture some deformation and failure details in the crushing processes. Taking into account the adhesive interface in the finite element (FE) model, glue debonding was simulated for the IPC loading, which is in good agreement with the experimental results at the skin panel buckling. Based on the experimental results, theoretical solutions for the TPB test were also established to predict the peak load, energy absorption and collapse mode.

However, design of these materials requires an understanding of the relationship between the AM process and material properties at different length scales: from the microstructure to geometric feature rendition to overall dynamic performance. To date, there remain significant uncertainties about both the potential benefits and pitfalls of using AM to design and optimise cellular materials for dynamic energy absorbing applications. This experimental investigation focuses on the out-of-plane compression of stainless steel cellular materials fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM), and makes two specific contributions. First, we demonstrate how the AM process itself influences the characteristics of these cellular materials across a range of length scales, and, crucially, how this influences the dynamic deformation. Secondly, we demonstrate how an AM route can be used to add geometric complexity to the cell structure, creating a versatile basis for future geometry optimisation. Starting with an AM square honeycomb (the reference case), we add porosity to the walls by replacing them with a lattice truss, while maintaining the same relative density. This geometry hybridisation is an approach uniquely suited to this manufacturing route. It is found that the hybrid lattice-walled honeycomb geometry significantly outperforms previously reported AM lattices in terms of specific strength, specific energy absorption, and energy absorption efficiency. It is also found that the hybrid geometry outperforms the benchmark metallic square honeycomb in terms of energy absorption efficiency in the intermediate impact velocity regime (i.e. between quasi-static loading and loading rates at which wave propagation effects begin to become pronounced), a regime in which the collapse is dominated by dynamic buckling effects. © 2017","Additive manufacturing; Blast; Cellular structures; Impact; Selective laser melting","3D printers; Blasting; Cellular manufacturing; Energy absorption; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Manufacture; Melting; Stainless steel; Wave propagation; Cellular structure; Different length scale; Energy absorption efficiency; Experimental investigations; Impact; Out-of-plane compression; Selective laser melting; Specific energy absorption; Hybrid materials","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Metal Foams A Design Guide, (2000); Maiti, Surjya K., Deformation and energy absorption diagrams for cellular solids, Acta Metallurgica, 32, 11, pp. 1963-1975, (1984); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Dynamic compression of metallic sandwich structures during planar impulsive loading in water, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 29, 1, pp. 56-67, (2010); Fleck, Norman A., The resistance of clamped sandwich beams to shock loading, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 71, 3, pp. 386-401, (2004); Deshpande, Vikram S., Foam topology: Bending versus stretching dominated architectures, Acta Materialia, 49, 6, pp. 1035-1040, (2001); Smith, Matthew, The quasi-static and blast response of steel lattice structures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 13, 4, pp. 479-501, (2011); Radford, Darren D., The response of clamped sandwich plates with metallic foam cores to simulated blast loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 43, 7-8, pp. 2243-2259, (2006); McShane, Graham J., The response of clamped sandwich plates with lattice cores subjected to shock loading, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 25, 2, pp. 215-229, (2006); Calladine, Christopher R., Strain-rate and inertia effects in the collapse of two types of energy-absorbing structure, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 26, 11-12, pp. 689-701, (1984)",""

Bio-inspired hexagonal and square honeycomb structures and lattice materials based on repeating unit cells composed of webs or trusses, when made from materials of high elastic stiffness and low density, represent some of the lightest, stiffest and strongest materials available today. Recent advances in 3D printing and automated assembly have enabled such complicated material geometries to be fabricated at low (and declining) cost. These mechanical metamaterials have properties that are a function of their mesoscale geometry as well as their constituents, leading to combinations of properties that are unobtainable in solid materials; however, a material geometry that achieves the theoretical upper bounds for isotropic elasticity and strain energy storage (the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds) has yet to be identified. Here we evaluate the manner in which strain energy distributes under load in a representative selection of material geometries, to identify the morphological features associated with high elastic performance. Using finite-element models, supported by analytical methods, and a heuristic optimization scheme, we identify a material geometry that achieves the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds on isotropic elastic stiffness. Previous work has focused on truss networks and anisotropic honeycombs, neither of which can achieve this theoretical limit. We find that stiff but well distributed networks of plates are required to transfer loads efficiently between neighbouring members. The resulting low-density mechanical metamaterials have many advantageous properties: their mesoscale geometry can facilitate large crushing strains with high energy absorption, optical bandgaps and mechanically tunable acoustic bandgaps, high thermal insulation, buoyancy, and fluid storage and transport. Our relatively simple design can be manufactured using origami-like sheet folding and bonding methods. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This paper introduces a novel configuration, namely double functionally graded (DFG) structure, which comprises of a functionally graded honeycomb filler in a functionally graded thickness (FGT) tube. Based on the validated finite element (FE) models, a comparative study on the DFG tube, single functionally graded (SFG) tube, and traditional uniform honeycomb filled uniform thickness (H-UT) tube were carried out to explore the crashing behaviors of different structures under multiple load cases. It is found that as crushing displacement increases, DFG structure exhibits superior capacity of energy absorption over other configurations and this trend is positively related to the impact angles. In addition, the comparisons of deformation modes and critical crushing angles clearly indicate that the DFG structure is of better and more stable crashing characteristics, being a crashworthy structure. Following the configurational comparison, further parametric studies on the DFG structures were conducted to explore the effects of tubal thickness range and honeycomb thickness range on the crashworthiness. It is found that the tube thickness range is more important to crashworthiness, which provides a basis for structural optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Composite structure; Energy absorption; Functionally-graded honeycomb; Functionally-graded thickness","Accidents; Composite structures; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Energy absorption; Fillers; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization; Tubes (components); Absorbing devices; Capacity of energies; Cellular material; Comparative studies; Different structure; Functionally graded; Honeycomb thickness; Multiple load case; Structural design","Alexander, J.

Rather than restating details of the existing standard regular hexagon HSP (R0-HSP), this paper introduces single-rib reinforced regular hexagon HSP (R1-HSP) and double-rib reinforced regular hexagon HSP (R2-HSP). The mechanical characteristics of these three structures are first investigated by series full-scale elaborator models through LS-DYNA. It is found that the R1-HSP has the best crashworthiness performance under axial impact regarding specific energy absorption per unit (SEAm and SEAv) when the peak crashing stress (σ<inf>peak</inf>) is less important. Secondly, the thickness matching effect between stiffener and cell wall is analyzed with equivalent apparent density index to evaluate the contribution of the change of deformation model to the general mechanical properties. Consequently, stiffener thickness of 2.0 times and 1.5 times that of cell wall are found to be the most optimal options for R1-HSP and R2-HSP, respectively. To optimize the crashworthiness of the R1-HSP, optimal Latin hypercube design method is used for selection of sampling design points in the design space. And in the meantime, an accurate surrogate modeling method, or more specifically named as response surface method, is adopted to formulate the SEAm, SEAv and σ<inf>peak</inf> functions. The results yielded from the optimization indicate that the R1-HSP is superior to R0-HSP both in SEAm and SEAv under the same limitation of σ<inf>peak</inf>. This research is significant in providing technical support in the extended applications of different HSPs used as crashworthiness structures, and it has essential reference value in low volume and low mass energy absorber design. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","crashworthiness optimization; honeycomb sandwich panel; mechanical characteristic; reinforcement; thickness matching effect","Biomechanics; Crashworthiness; Density (specific gravity); Design; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Mechanical properties; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Structural panels; Crashworthiness optimization; Deformation modeling; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Matching effects; Mechanical characteristics; Optimal latin hypercube designs; Response surface method; Specific energy absorption; Structural design","Wadley, Hayden N.G., Multifunctional periodic cellular metals, Philosophical transactions.

First, a finite element (FE) model of the energy-absorbing structure was established and validated by corresponding experiments. Based on the validated FE model, the effects of the strength of honeycomb on the impact performance of the energy-absorbing structure were evaluated. The results showed that the initial peak force and the average impact force increase with the increasing strength of honeycomb, and the energy absorption also follows the same trend in a certain range of combined strength. Then, to optimise the crashworthiness of the energy-absorbing structure, the multi-objective optimisation, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the polynomial response surface method were adopted, The optima were given in the form of Pareto fronts and the most satisfactory solution was determined by the minimum distance between ‘utopia point’ and knee point. The results showed that whether the best optima can be obtained has nothing to do with the accuracy of the surrogate models.

Both the single-objective and multi-objective optimizations are performed for columns under axial crushing load with core thickness and helix pitch of the honeycomb core as design variables. Models are optimized by multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to achieve maximum specific energy absorption (SEA) capacity and minimum peak crushing force (PCF). Results show that optimization improves the energy absorption characteristics with constrained and unconstrained peak crashing load. Also, it is concluded that the aluminum tube has a better energy absorption capability rather than steel tube at a certain peak crushing force. The results justify that the interaction effects between the honeycomb and column walls greatly improve the energy absorption efficiency. A ranking technique for order preference (TOPSIS) is then used to sort the non-dominated solutions by the preference of decision makers. That is, a multi-criteria decision which consists of MOPSO and TOPSIS is presented to find out a compromise solution for decision makers. Furthermore, local and global sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the effect of design variable values on the SEA and PCF functions in design domain. Based on the sensitivity analysis results, it is concluded that for both models, the helix pitch of the honeycomb core has greater effect on the sensitivity of SEA, while, the core thickness has greater effect on the sensitivity of PCF. © © 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Crashworthiness; Diamond core; Energy absorption; Honeycomb columns; Optimization; Response surface method; Sensitivity analysis","Constrained optimization; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Decision making; Diamonds; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensitivity analysis; Tubular steel structures; Absorption characteristics; Energy absorption capability; Energy absorption efficiency; Global sensitivity analysis; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Nondominated solutions; Response surface method; Specific energy absorption; Multiobjective optimization","Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Dynamic axial crushing of square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 2, 2, pp. 179-208, (1984); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Dynamic axial crushing of circular tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 2, 3, pp. 263-281, (1984); Acar, Erdem, Multi-objective crashworthiness optimization of tapered thin-walled tubes with axisymmetric indentations, Thin-Walled Structures, 49, 1, pp. 94-105, (2011); Athan, Timothy Ward, A note on weighted criteria methods for compromise solutions in multi-objective optimization, Engineering Optimization, 27, 2, pp. 155-176, (1996); Avalle, Massimiliano, Design optimization by response surface methodology: Application to crashworthiness design of vehicle structures, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 24, 4, pp. 325-332, (2002); Chen, Mei Fiang, Combining grey relation and TOPSIS concepts for selecting an expatriate host country, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 40, 13, pp. 1473-1490, (2004); Chiandussi, Giorgio, Maximisation of the crushing performance of a tubular device by shape optimisation, Computers and Structures, 80, 27-30, pp. 2425-2432, (2002); Deng, Hepu, Inter-company comparison using modified TOPSIS with objective weights, Computers and Operations Research, 27, 10, pp. 963-973, (2000); Ebrahimi, Saeed, Multiobjective optimization and sensitivity analysis of honeycomb sandwich cylindrical columns under axial crushing loads, Thin-Walled Structures, 88, pp. 90-104, (2015); Fang, Howie, A comparative study of metamodeling methods for multiobjective crashworthiness optimization, Computers and Structures, 83, 25-26, pp. 2121-2136, (2005)",""

To estimate the buffering and energy absorbing capacity of aluminum honeycomb, we designed and tested a cylindrical cushioning structure with two types of aluminum honeycomb. In the experiments, the out-of-plane crushing behavior of aluminum honeycombs was investigated on three types of samples including single honeycomb sample, stacked samples with two honeycombs, and three honeycombs at a fixed quasi-static loading condition. The results show that the energy-absorbing capacity of combined honeycomb sample is slightly better than that of the single honeycomb sample with the same total thickness in the concerned range. However, the collapse stress will significantly increase when two specimens with approximately the same thickness insert into each other completely, which should be avoided in the cushioning design. The design of combined honeycomb consisted of three stacked honeycombs can obtain a relatively smooth stress state, which is beneficial to protect the cylinder. As a result, one can draw a conclusion that combined honeycomb buffer consisted of multi-layered honeycomb samples should be given priority in the optimization design of aluminum honeycomb buffer.

Rather than restating details of the existing traditional regular hexagonal honeycomb, this paper introduces reinforced hexagonal honeycomb. The full-scale elaborator finite-element model created through LS-DYNA is validated by available theoretical solutions and experimental results. Afterwards, the validated simulation model is further applied to do a number of parametric studies on the reinforced hexagonal honeycomb under dynamic impact. The parameters such as stiffener thickness, expanding angle, cell length, cell wall thickness, impact mass, impact velocity and end constraint are employed to determine their relative effects on crushing behaviour of the reinforced hexagonal honeycomb. In the multi-objective crashworthiness optimisation, optimal Latin hypercube design method is used to select the sampling design points from the design space. To obtain a maximum specific energy absorption per mass () capability and minimum initial peak stress (), response surface method, which is an accurate surrogate modelling method is adopted. The optimisation results show that the reinforced hexagonal honeycomb has a better energy absorption performance within the same limit of.

The layers of corrugated sandwich panels vary from two to six. The corrugated cores were fabricated by a self-made mould and then bonded to interlayer and face sheets so as to produce different specimens.

The purpose of this research is the analyses of graded honeycomb structure (GHS) behaviour under in-plane impact loading and its optimisation. Primarily, analytical equations for plateau stress and specific energy are represented, taking power hardening model (PHM) and elastic-perfectly plastic model (EPPM) into consideration. For the validation and comparison of acquired analytical equations, the energy absorption of a GHS made of five different aluminium grades is simulated in ABAQUS/CAE. In order to validate the numerical simulation method in ABAQUS, an experimental test has been conducted as the falling a weight with low velocity on a GHS. Numerical results retain an acceptable accordance with experimental ones with a 5.4% occurred error of reaction force. For a structure with a specific kinetic energy, the stress-strain diagram is achieved and compared with the analytical equations obtained. The maximum difference between the numerical and analytical plateau stresses for PHM is 10.58%. However, this value has been measured to be 38.78% for EPPM. In addition, the numerical value of absorbed energy is compared to that of analytical method for two material models. The maximum difference between the numerical and analytical absorbed energies for PHM model is 6.4%, while it retains the value of 48.08% for EPPM. Based on the conducted comparisons, the numerical and analytical results based on PHM are more congruent than EPPM results. Applying sequential quadratic programming method and genetic algorithm, the ratio of structure mass to the absorbed energy is minimised. According to the optimisation results, the structure capacity of absorbing energy increases by 18% compared to the primary model. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","graded honeycomb structure; in-plane impact load; optimisation; plateau stress; power hardening; specific absorbed energy (SAE)","Energy absorption; Genetic algorithms; Hardening; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Numerical methods; Quadratic programming; Shock absorbers; Stress-strain curves; Absorbed energy; Elastic perfectly plastic; Experimental and numerical studies; In-plane impact; Numerical simulation method; Optimisations; Plateau stress; Sequential Quadratic Programming method; Analytical models","10th Iran Aerospace Conference Aero2011, (2011); Ajdari, Amin, Dynamic crushing and energy absorption of regular, irregular and functionally graded cellular structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 3-4, pp. 506-516, (2011); Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Design and Manufacture, (2006); Mechanics of Materials, (1992); Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Numerical Optimization Theoretical and Practical Aspects, (2006); Deqiang, Sun, Mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses of hexagonal honeycomb cores under impact loadings, Composite Structures, 92, 11, pp. 2609-2621, (2010); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Electronic Computation American Society of Civil Engineers, (1986); Horstemeyer, Mark Fredrick, A comparative study of design optimisation methodologies for side-impact crashworthiness, using injury-based versus energy-based criterion, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 14, 2, pp. 125-138, (2009)",""

The simplified super folding element (SSFE) theory is applied to estimate the energy dissipation of the typical elements. Taking the inertia effects into account, dynamic mean compressive stress calculating equation is further deduced by utilizing the dynamic enhancement coefficient. In order to validate these theoretical solutions, LS-DYNA is used to simulate the axial loading of three novel honeycombs. The analytical results correlate with these simulation results in an ideal manner. During the multi-objective optimization deign, optimal Latin hypercube design (OLHD) method is used to select sampling points in the design space. Meanwhile, the response surface method (RSM), as an accurate surrogate modeling method, is adopted to obtain a maximum specific energy absorption per mass (SEA<inf>m</inf>) capacity and minimum peak crushing stress (σ<inf>peak</inf>). These results yielded from the optimization indicate that the bending cellular honeycomb (BC-H) has the best energy absorption performance under the same limitation of σ<inf>peak</inf>. Furthermore, the theoretical equations proposed are utilized to validate the simulation results of three optimal structures.

In evaluation of the safety of conceptual design through simulation, several key parameters considered in this research are maximum impact force, energy dissipated by the impactor (e.g. a ship) and energy absorbed by the device and the impactor stroke. During impact, the main function of the ring beam structure is to resist and buffer the impact force between ship and bridge pile caps, which could guarantee that the magnitude of impact force meets the corresponding requirements. The means of improving anti-collision performance can be to increase the strength of the beam section or to exchange the steel material with novel fiber reinforced polymer laminates. The main function of the buoyancy tank is to absorb and transfer the ship's kinetic energy through large plastic deformation, damage, or friction occurring within itself. The energy absorption effect can be improved by structure optimization or by the use of new sandwich panels.

Encouraged by the importance of this field of study, this research attempts an improvement in the crashworthiness of a vehicle crash absorber. This component consists in a square hollow steel tube filled with a honeycomb structure made of glass-fiber reinforced polyamide. Surrogate-based optimization techniques are used. The three objective functions chosen - mass, absorbed energy and peak load - are approximated by two different models: multivariate adaptive regression splines and Gaussian process (kriging). The thickness of both parts, the shape of the honeycomb and its height are selected as design variables. Two preliminary analyses of the specimen are performed: the computation of the interaction effect and a comparison of a hollow tube with the specimen. From the results of multi-objective crashworthiness optimization two Pareto frontiers are obtained, one for the absorbed energy and mass, and another one for the absorbed energy and peak load. The results achieved show great improvements on all objective functions compared to the original design. The peak load is reduced by 37% on a specimen with similar mass and absorbed energy, and the specific energy absorbed is increased by 39.5% for a specimen with a similar peak load to the one from the initial model. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Crashworthiness; Genetic algorithm; Honeycomb structure; Multi-objective optimization; Surrogate methods","Accidents; Automotive industry; Crashworthiness; Genetic algorithms; Honeycomb structures; Tubular steel structures; Crashworthiness optimization; Gaussian Processes; Interaction effect; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Objective functions; Preliminary analysis; Surrogate methods; Surrogate-based optimization; Multiobjective optimization","Early Estimate of Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities in 2012, (2025); Alexander, J.

Explicit dynamic finite element method simulations are carried out by using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Firstly, under the assumption that the cell wall length is the same, a density-graded honeycomb mode is established by the variation of the cell wall thicknesses along the crushing direction. The effects of density gradient and impact velocity on the crushing deformation modes, plateau stresses and energy absorption characteristics of the specimens are explored in detail. Numerical results show that except for the impact velocity, the dynamic crushing performance and energy absorption abilities of honeycombs also rely on the density/strength gradients. The weakest layer is suggested to be placed at the impact end or the output end, and the strongest layer at the intermediate stage to achieve higher energy absorbing efficiency. According to the one-dimensional shock wave theory, the simple empirical formulae for graded honeycombs to predict the plateau stress are given under high-impact velocities. These results will provide some useful guides in the multi-objective optimization dynamic design and shock energy absorbing control of sandwich structures. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","energy absorption; gradient design; Honeycombs; impact behavior; in-plane","Absorption characteristics; Energy absorbing efficiencies; Explicit dynamic finite element method; Honeycombs; Impact behavior; in-plane; In-plane dynamic crushing; One-dimensional shock wave theories; Crushing; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Energy absorption","Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Forsvarmedicin, (1971); Cooper, Graham J., The role of stress waves in thoracic visceral injury from blast loading: Modification of stress transmission by foams and high-density materials, Journal of Biomechanics, 24, 5, pp. 273-285, (1991); Cripps, Neil P.J., The influence of personal blast protection on the distribution and severity of primary blast gut injury, Journal of Trauma, 40, 3 SUPPL., pp. S206-S211, (1996); Li, Qingming, Attenuation or enhancement - A one-dimensional analysis on shock transmission in the solid phase of a cellular material, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 27, 10, pp. 1049-1065, (2002); Li, Qingming, About one-dimensional shock propagation in a cellular material, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 11, pp. 1898-1906, (2006); Elnasri, Ibrahim, Shock enhancement of cellular structures under impact loading: Part I Experiments, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2652-2671, (2007); Pattofatto, Stéphane, Shock enhancement of cellular structures under impact loading: Part II analysis, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2672-2686, (2007); Zhu, Feng, Shock enhancement effect of lightweight composite structures and materials, Composites Part B: Engineering, 42, 5, pp. 1202-1211, (2011)",""

Specific energy absorption (SEA) was defined as the energy absorbed by the honeycomb structure per unit volume. This parameter was often used for determining the crashworthiness of thin-walled structures. In order to find the most optimized metal square honeycomb structure with the maximum SEA and the lowest peak stress, the cell length and the foil thickness of the metal honeycombs were optimized, with a low peak stress and a high SEA set as the two primary objectives. The pre-processing software Patran was used to build FE models, and the explicit solver LS-DYNA was employed to perform the crashworthiness analyses. The results show that the square honeycomb exhibits good energy absorption performance in some cases.

The dynamic responses of the AFSPs with various combinations of face-sheet materials were analyzed using LS-DYNA. It was found that the AFSP with an aluminum (AA2024 T3) front face and a Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) steel back face (labeled T3-AF-RHA) outperformed the other panel configurations in terms of maximum back face deflection (MaxD) and areal specific energy absorption (ASEA). It was also found that boundary conditions and the standoff distance (SoD) between an explosive and a target surface both have a remarkable influence on the blast response of the AFSPs. Using artificial neural network (ANN) approximation models, multi-objective design optimization (MDO) of the T3-AF-RHA panel was performed both with and without variations in blast load intensity. The optimization results show that the two objectives of MaxD minimization and ASEA maximization conflict with each other and that the optimal designs must be identified in a Pareto sense. Moreover, the Pareto curves obtained are different for varied blast impulse levels. Consequently, it is concluded that loading variation should be considered when designing such sandwich armors to achieve more robust blast-resistant performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast; Finite element; Impact; Optimization; Robustness; Sandwich","Approximation model; Impact; Multi-objective design optimization; Panel configurations; Rolled homogeneous armors; Sandwich; Specific energy absorption; Stand-off distance (SoD); Armor; Blasting; Dynamic response; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Military vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Optimization; Robustness (control systems); Sandwich structures; Explosives","(Gama) Haque, Bazle Z., Aluminum foam integral armor: A new dimension in armor design, Composite Structures, 52, 3-4, pp. 381-395, (2001); Fleck, Norman A., The resistance of clamped sandwich beams to shock loading, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 71, 3, pp. 386-401, (2004); Zhu, Feng, Analytical investigation and optimal design of sandwich panels subjected to shock loading, Materials and Design, 30, 1, pp. 91-100, (2009); Xue, Zhenyu, Preliminary assessment of sandwich plates subject to blast loads, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 45, 4, pp. 687-705, (2003); Xue, Zhenyu, A comparative study of impulse-resistant metal sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 30, 10, pp. 1283-1305, (2004); Zhu, Feng, Deformation and failure of blast-loaded metallic sandwich panels-Experimental investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 8, pp. 937-951, (2008); Nurick, Gerald N., Behaviour of sandwich panels subjected to intense air blast - Part 1: Experiments, Composite Structures, 91, 4, pp. 433-441, (2009); Zhu, Feng, Structural response and energy absorption of sandwich panels with an aluminium foam core under blast loading, Advances in Structural Engineering, 11, 5, pp. 525-536, (2008); Hanssen, Arve Grønsund, Close-range blast loading of aluminium foam panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 27, 6, pp. 593-618, (2002); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008)",""

Thin-walled cellular structures (honeycomb) have the ability to absorb impact energy during crashing, thus it is important to enhance the crushing efficiency and optimise the structural reliability. The optimisation carried out in this study is aimed at maximising the energy absorption characteristics using meta-models while considering some limitation on the maximum force as a constraint. Achieving these characteristics is an important factor in crashworthiness analysis, which minimises the damage in dynamic performance. The objective of using various meta-models is to qualify the meta-model in crashworthiness analysis using different point selection schemes and different number of points. The optimisation is performed in two stages; through experimental design methods in which a set of sampling points is selected from design space and polynomial fitting in order to optimise the objective. It is concluded that D-optimal best suits response surface method for model approximation. Kriging performed best by space filling and the best point selection scheme for radial basis surrogate is latin hypercube design. The results show that for optimising the crashworthiness characteristics of honeycomb, Kriging and quadratic response surface (RS) are best, in terms of accuracy and robustness point of view and the radial basis neural network would be the second best. During this optimisation, the RS was combined with detailed geometrically simplified finite element model of honeycomb cell using ANSYS/LS-DYNA, LS-DYNA and LS-opt packages. Approximated functions combined with the finite element analysis were an effective tool to optimise highly non-linear impact problems. This has led to the development of validated algorithm that enabled the development of the optimised solutions. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","crashworthiness; latin hypercube design (LH-DOE); linear response surface method (L-RSM); quadratic response surface method (Q-RSM); radial basis function (RBF); radial basis neural network (RBNN)","Latin hypercube designs; Linear response; Quadratic response; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Radial basis neural networks; Crashworthiness; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Interpolation; Mathematical models; Optimization; Radial basis function networks; Surface properties; Structural design","Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Design and Manufacture, (2006); Shape Optimization of Plates to Mitigate the Effects of Air Blast Loading, (2009); Response Surface Methodology, (2004); Chiandussi, Giorgio, Maximisation of the crushing performance of a tubular device by shape optimisation, Computers and Structures, 80, 27-30, pp. 2425-2432, (2002); Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, (2002); Côté, François, The shear response of metallic square honeycombs, Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures, 1, 7, pp. 1281-1299, (2006); Dar, Fazilat H., Statistical methods in finite element analysis, Journal of Biomechanics, 35, 9, pp. 1155-1161, (2002); Deshpande, Vikram S., Collapse of truss core sandwich beams in 3-point bending, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 38, 36-37, pp. 6275-6305, (2001); Fang, Howie, Global response approximation with radial basis functions, Engineering Optimization, 38, 4, pp. 407-424, (2006); Forrester, Alexander I.J., Recent advances in surrogate-based optimization, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 45, 1-3, pp. 50-79, (2009)",""

However, many other metal honeycomb structures also show good energy absorption characteristics. Currently, most of the researches focus on hexagonal honeycomb, while few are performed into different honeycomb structures. Therefore, a new alternative square honeycomb is developed to expand the non-hexagonal metal honeycomb applications in the energy absorption fields with the aim of designing low mass and low volume energy absorbers. The finite element model of alternative square honeycomb is built to analyze its specific energy absorption property. As the diversity of honeycomb structure, the parameterized metal honeycomb finite element analysis program is conducted based on PCL language. That program can automatically create finite element model. Numerical results show that with the same foil thickness and cell length of metal honeycomb, the alternative square has better specific energy absorption than hexagonal honeycomb. Using response surface method, the mathematical formulas of honeycomb crashworthiness properties are obtained and optimization is done to get the maximum specific energy absorption property honeycomb. Optimal results demonstrate that to absorb same energy, alternative square honeycomb can save 10% volume of buffer structure than hexagonal honeycomb can do.

This study exemplifies corrugated sandwich panels with trapezoidal and triangular cores to determine the relationship between the structural parameters and the crashworthiness under low-velocity local impact and planar impact, further optimizing these structural parameters with the crashworthiness criteria by using multiobjective optimization techniques. The configurations of trapezoidal and triangular core cells are firstly optimized for maximizing energy absorption.

The comparative results show that honeycomb sandwich panel can absorb more energy than the bare honeycomb core, though the peak crushing force of honeycomb sandwich panel is larger. Then the factor screening experiments are carried out to find out variables that have significant effects on the crashworthiness of honeycomb sandwich panel. The ultimate purpose of factor screening experiments is to decrease the computational expense by reducing the number of design variables.

While the crushing responses in terms of energy absorption and densification strains have been extensively researched and reported, a gap is identified in the generalization of honeycombs with contr'olled and varying geometric parameters. This paper addresses this gap through a series of finite element (FE) simulations where the cell angle and the inclined wall thickness, are varied while maintaining a constant mass of the honeycomb structure. A randomly filled, nonrepeating design of experiments (DOEs) is generated to determine the effects of these geometric parameters on the output of energy absorbed and a statistical sensitivity analysis is used to determine the parameters significant for the crushing energy absorption of honeycombs. It is found that while an increase in the inclined wall thickness enhances the energy absorption of the structure, increases in either the cell angle or ratio of cell angle to inclined wall thickness have adverse effects on the output. Finally, the optimization results suggest that a cellular geometry with a positive cell angle and a high inclined wall thickness provides for maximum energy absorption, which is verified with a 6 error when compared to a FE simulation. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","crushing; design of experiments; honeycombs; mesostructure; optimization","Cells; Crushing; Cytology; Design of experiments; Finite element method; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Sensitivity analysis; Cellulars; Crushing energy; Energy absorption properties; Finite elements simulation; Honeycomb; Inclined walls; Mesostructures; Optimisations; Wall thickness; Energy absorption","Tarlochan, Faris, Sustainability design: Reduction of vehicle mass without compromizing crashworthiness, pp. 374-378, (2009); Deqiang, Sun, Mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses of hexagonal honeycomb cores under impact loadings, Composite Structures, 92, 11, pp. 2609-2621, (2010); Ajdari, Amin, Dynamic crushing and energy absorption of regular, irregular and functionally graded cellular structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 3-4, pp. 506-516, (2011); Zheng, Zhijun, Dynamic crushing of 2D cellular structures: A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 650-664, (2005); Nakamoto, Hiroaki, In-plane impact behavior of honeycomb structures randomly filled with rigid inclusions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 73-80, (2009); Nakamoto, Hiroaki, In-plane impact behavior of honeycomb structures filled with linearly arranged inclusions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 8, pp. 1019-1026, (2009); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Li, Kuo An, Dynamic crushing behavior of honeycomb structures with irregular cell shapes and non-uniform cell wall thickness, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 44, 14-15, pp. 5003-5026, (2007); Wang, Dongmei, Impact behavior and energy absorption of paper honeycomb sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 110-114, (2009); International Journal of Vehicle Design, (2010)",""

In order to improve the energy absorption capacity, crashworthiness optimization for honeycomb structures with various cell specifications are studied in this paper. Detailed numerical models are established for those honeycomb structures by using an explicit finite element method code LS-DYNA. The numerical simulation results are then used as the design samples for constructing metamodels. The optimal Latin hypercube design (OLHD) method is employed for the selection of sampling design points in the design space, and the polynomial functions, radial basis functions (RBF), Kriging, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and support vector regression (SVR) are utilized to formulate the two optimal objectives SEA and σ<inf>p</inf>.

In order to further validate the polynomial function models, the polynomial function models of SEA and σ<inf>p</inf> are compared with the analytical solutions based on Wierzbicki's theory and Kunimoto and Yamada's theory, respectively. An excellent correlation has been established.

This paper firstly investigates the energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb-filled single and bitubular polygonal tubes (HSBPT) by nonlinear finite element analysis through LS-DYNA. By employing a six-level judgement method, we find that both of the honeycomb-filled single and honeycomb-filled bitubular tubes with enneagonal configuration have very excellent energy absorption characteristics among the considered cases. Next, the HSBPTs with enneagonal configuration are optimized by adopting multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to achieve maximum specific energy absorption (SEA) capacity and minimum peak crushing force (PCF). During the process of multiobjective optimization design (MOD), accurate metamodels of SEA and PCF of the HSBPTs with enneagonal configuration are established to reduce the computational cost of crash simulations by finite element method. Numerical experiments show that the quartic polynomial functions of SEA and PCF are the suitable metamodels for both honeycomb-filled single and bitubular enneagonal tubes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","A.

Results indicate that RH has no significant effect on plateau stress, or energy absorption capacity of honeycomb paperboard in RH range between 40-75%, but its energy absorption properties decrease substantially with the increasing of RH when the RH exceeds 75%. It is concluded that RH is a significant consideration for honeycomb paperboard as a cushioning material used in extremely humid environments most probably encountered in south-east coast of China, while under ordinary circumstances, there is no need to consider the effect of RH. Energy absorption diagram based on the effect of RH is constructed from the stress-strain curves obtained from tests, and its application for a given energy absorption task is exemplified.

The mass of the whole crush element and the outer dimension of the section are kept constant, while the side length of inner profile and the thickness of the inner and outer wall are used as design variables. The nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA is adopted to simulate the axial crushing behaviour of bitubal columns and the response surface method is applied to obtain the optimum design in the design space.

Failure mechanism maps have been devised that account for interactions between core and face members during buckling. The optimal dimensions and the minimum weight have been evaluated. The load capacities predicted for near-optimal designs have been validated by conducting selected finite element calculations. Designs that use diamond prismatic cores (with corrugation order 4) are slightly more weight efficient than trusses, when optimized for a specific loading direction. Honeycomb cores, while somewhat more weight efficient, especially at lower load capacities, are not amenable to the fluid flows needed for cooling. We conclude that the diamond prismatic topology is the most weight efficient among designs amenable to simultaneous load bearing and active cooling. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Collapse is either by a travelling plastic hinge or by tearing. An analytical model is developed for the travelling plastic hinge in a rigid, ideally plastic solid; its predictions are compared with the observed response, and with those of an axisymmetric finite element analysis. The travelling hinge mechanism is also observed in the compressive collapse of an egg-box material comprising a square array of conical frustra. Collapse mechanism maps are constructed for the egg-box material, and they show the regimes of dominance of elastic buckling, material tearing and the travelling plastic hinge. The maps are useful for selecting egg-box geometries that maximise the energy absorption per unit mass at any prescribed value of collapse stress. The optimisation indicates that the egg-box material has a similar energy absorption capacity to that of hexagonal honeycombs and is superior to that of metal foams. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This investigation studied the effects of land surface roughness, abradable land porosity, rub grooves in abradable lands, and honeycomb land cell size and depth on leakage using a standard labyrinth seal. The effects of rotation on the optimum seal knife pitch were also investigated. Selected geometric and aerodynamic parameters for an advanced seal design were evaluated to derive an optimal performance configuration. The rotational energy requirements were also measured to determine the inherent friction and pumping energy absorbed by the various seal knife and land configurations tested in order to properly assess the net seal system performance level. The results obtained in this program show that seal leakage can be significantly affected with honeycomb or abradable lands, rotational energy absorption does not vary significantly with the use of a solid-smooth, an abradable, or a honeycomb land and optimization of an advanced labyrinth seal design produced a configuration that had leakage 25% below a conventional stepped seal.
