Inspired by the arrowhead-shaped leaf venation microstructure, an enhanced star-shaped hybrid honeycomb (ESSHH) with tunable Poisson's ratio is proposed by incorporating different arrow-shaped supporting ribs into the TSSH. The TSSH and ESSHH structural models were then constructed through 3D printing technology, and the quasi-static compressive mechanical performance and deformation mechanisms of the 3D-printed TSSH and ESSHH structural models were explored using experimental methods and finite element simulation. The investigation results show that, compared to the TSSH, the ESSHH exhibits notable improvements in both relative elastic modulus and specific energy absorption (SEA). As the structural length l<inf>2</inf> increases, the stiffness and SEA of the ESSHH initially rise and subsequently decline, revealing an optimal design parameter. The ESSHH exhibits dramatic improvement over the TSSH, with increases of approximately 700% in relative elastic modulus and 500% in specific energy absorption. These enhancements highlight its significant potential for structural protection and impact mitigation in civil and infrastructure engineering, owing to its enhanced stiffness and superior energy absorption capacities. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Compressive response; Energy absorption; Negative Poisson's ratio; Star-shaped honeycomb","Elastic moduli; Honeycomb structures; Loads (forces); Microstructure; Poisson ratio; Shear flow; Specific energy; Stars; Stiffness; Compressive response; Energy; Energy absorption capacity; Leaf venation; Load-bearing; Negative Poisson ratio; Specific energy absorption; Star-shaped; Star-shaped honeycomb; Structural modeling; Energy absorption","Zheng, Xiaoyang, Deep Learning in Mechanical Metamaterials: From Prediction and Generation to Inverse Design, Advanced Materials, 35, 45, (2023); Ren, Xin, Auxetic metamaterials and structures: A review, Smart Materials and Structures, 27, 2, (2018); Huang, Chuanwei, Negative Poisson's Ratio in Modern Functional Materials, Advanced Materials, 28, 37, pp. 8079-8096, (2016); Scarpa, Fabrizio L., On the transverse shear modulus of negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structures, Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures, 23, 8, pp. 717-720, (2000); Chen, Mingming, Elastic properties of lightweight rotating square structures, Materials Today Communications, 33, (2022); Bianchi, Matteo, Stiffness and energy dissipation in polyurethane auxetic foams, Journal of Materials Science, 43, 17, pp. 5851-5860, (2008); Donoghue, J.

Conventional pier protection systems, characterized by excessive structural rigidity and inadequate energy dissipation capacity, fail to provide sufficient protection for modern bridge structures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel flexible bridge collision mitigation device featuring a glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) lattice structure with foamed aluminum (FA) filler. The modular design employs standardized blocks to provide effective impact protection for bridge piers. To validate the performance of the proposed device, material properties tests were first conducted on GFRP and FA, to determine simulation parameters for the finite element (FE) analysis. Subsequently, FE models of the collision mitigation device incorporating various lattice configurations were developed, followed by drop hammer simulation analysis using LS-DYNA software. Finally, the FE model of the vehicle-bridge collision was established, and the dynamic response analysis of the vehicle-bridge collision was carried out. The results demonstrate that the trapezoidal lattice configuration exhibits superior performance in three key metrics: energy absorption capacity, peak impact force mitigation, and dynamic response characteristics, outperforming both honeycomb and dislocation lattice structures. The proposed flexible collision mitigation device shows significant potential for effective pier protection while substantially reducing vehicular damage during collision events. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Collision test; Failure analysis; Flexible collision mitigation device; Simulation analysis; Vehicle-bridge collision","Beams and girders; Computer software; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Dynamic response; Dynamics; Energy dissipation; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Rigid structures; Vehicles; Collision mitigation; Collision tests; Dynamic response analysis; Flexible collision mitigation device; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); Lattice structures; Mitigation devices; Simulation analysis; Vehicle bridges; Vehicle-bridge collision; Failure analysis","Mraih, Haider, A review of energy-dissipating systems for over-height vehicle bridge impact mitigation, Engineering Structures, 330, (2025); Association, (1994); Zhou, Xiuneng, COLLAPSE MODES OF CONCRETE REINFORCED SQUARE BRIDGE PIERS UNDER VEHICLE COLLISION, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 60, 3, pp. 375-384, (2022); Zhou, Chang, Response and shear mechanism of RC bridge piers confined with CFRP grid-reinforced ECC subjected to truck collision, Engineering Failure Analysis, 143, (2023); Fan, Wei, A novel UHPFRC-based protective structure for bridge columns against vehicle collisions: Experiment, simulation, and optimization, Engineering Structures, 207, (2020); Wang, Junjie, Evaluation of composite crashworthy device for pier protection against barge impact, Ocean Engineering, 169, pp. 144-158, (2018); Liu, Bin, Experimental investigation and improved FE modeling of axially-loaded circular RC columns under lateral impact loading, Engineering Structures, 152, pp. 619-642, (2017); Qu, Yunfei, Experiment and finite element analysis of protective honeycombs based on equivalent method for ocean engineering under impact loading, Composite Structures, 331, (2024); X, Liu, Impact force-damage depth model for ship-bridge collision, Engineering Failure Analysis, 167, (2025); Blaich, Michael, Extended grid based collision avoidance considering COLREGs for vessels, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 9, PART 1, pp. 416-421, (2012)",""

However, conventional honeycomb designs often suffer from limited load-bearing capacity, single-stage collapse behavior, and insufficient energy absorption efficiency, making them inadequate for high-performance energy-absorbing systems. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel Framed Diamond-Star Honeycomb (FDSH) structure with a dual-plateau response. The mechanical performance and energy absorption characteristics of the proposed structure were systematically investigated through quasi-static compression experiments and finite element simulations. The effects of key geometric parameters, including cell angles and wall thickness, were also analyzed. The results show that the FDSH structure exhibits a distinct dual-plateau behavior during compression and achieves significant improvements in specific energy absorption—by approximately 238.18% and 161.97%—compared to traditional star-shaped honeycombs (SSH) and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs (REH), respectively.

However, in nature it is seen that certain species are found to have biological sutures in regions of their body where they are accustomed to dynamic loading. This has inspired the implementation of sutural geometries into originally flat regular hexagonal honeycomb tessellation interfaces comprised of harder hexagonal phases joined by a thinner, softer phase. These sutures are characterized by their tooth tip angle, wavelength, and amplitude and are studied to determine their influences the mechanical responses of the samples under dynamic indentation loading. Interestingly, suture tessellations can achieve negative Poisson's ratio in a certain design space. Both auxetic and non-auxetic designs under dynamic indentation loadings have been investigated via finite element (FE) simulations. Dynamic explicit FE simulations are conducted, using elasto-perfectly-plastic models for both hard and soft phases. The introduction of suture geometry leads to less plastic deformation in the composites, better dispersion of impact energy, and a lower peak load compared to the original flat tessellation counterparts. Additionally, results show that for 2D sutural tessellations, auxeticity enhances energy dissipation efficiency under dynamic indentation load. © 2025 The Authors","Dynamic indentation; Finite element; Impact; Shear; Sutural tessellation","Dynamics; Geometry; Indentation; Loading; Auxetics; Dynamic indentation; Dynamic loadings; Finite element; Finite elements simulation; Impact; Mechanical response; Shear; Soft phasis; Sutural tessellation; Dynamic loads; Energy dissipation; plastic; Article; controlled study; dispersion; finite element analysis; geometry; mechanics","Braunshtein, Ofer, Nanoscale dynamic mechanical analysis on interfaces of biological composites, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 146, (2023); Chen, Irene H., Leatherback sea turtle shell: A tough and flexible biological design, Acta Biomaterialia, 28, pp. 2-12, (2015); Cohen, Sidney R., Dynamic nanoindentation by instrumented nanoindentation and force microscopy: A comparative review, Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology, 4, 1, pp. 815-833, (2013); Collinson, David W., Best practices and recommendations for accurate nanomechanical characterization of heterogeneous polymer systems with atomic force microscopy, Progress in Polymer Science, 119, (2021); Dong, Shujing, Mechanical response of 3D printed irregular sutural tessellations with Voronoi tile patterns under tension, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 307, (2024); Dunlop, John W.C., Artful interfaces within biological materials, Materials Today, 14, 3, pp. 70-78, (2011); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Gao, Chao, Instability-Induced Pattern Transformation in Soft Metamaterial with Hexagonal Networks for Tunable Wave Propagation, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Gao, Chao, Amplifying Strength, Toughness, and Auxeticity via Wavy Sutural Tessellation in Plant Seedcoats, Advanced Materials, 30, 36, (2018); Gao, Chao, Mechanical model of bio-inspired composites with sutural tessellation, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 122, pp. 190-204, (2019)",""

To enhance the mechanical performance of sandwich structures under multifunctional loads, this paper introduces a novel hybrid design that leverages auxetic structures to synergistically strengthen PMI foam cores. Three types of sandwich structures were fabricated and experimentally investigated to compare their mechanical responses and crashworthiness, demonstrating the superior performance of the novel design under multiple loading conditions. Then, the deformation and failure modes of the sandwich structures under multi-loading conditions were analyzed in detail. Finally, a mesoscale finite element modeling (FEM) methodology for composite foam sandwich structures was proposed. The results indicate that the novel hybrid sandwich structure exhibits significant improvements over traditional PMI foam sandwich structures under flatwise compression (108% increase in EA and 19 % increase in SEA), edgewise compression (411 % increase in EA and 177 % increase in SEA), and low-velocity impact (153 % increase in EA and 50 % increase in SEA) conditions.

This study investigates the impact of negative stiffness metamaterials on the acoustic performance of composite panels at frequencies below 1000 Hz. Utilizing the Finite Element (FE) Method, the quasi-static behavior and sound transmission loss (STL) in a proposed flat composite panel incorporating a negative stiffness core are studied. To characterize the core’s behavior, its stiffness has been analyzed under various compression levels. Subsequently, by applying an initial pressure to the core structure, the core is subjected to negative stiffness conditions, and its effect on the STL behavior of the panel is examined. The study encompassed an evaluation of the effects of compression-induced deformation and stress changes within the core on acoustic performance. The STL behavior in the proposed sandwich panel is compared with a well-known hexagonal honeycomb core, maintaining identical mass and dimensions. Results demonstrate that compressing the panel with a negative stiffness core, reduces resonance regions in the STL spectrum, leading to a significant enhancement in sound insulation across a broad frequency range.

This study investigates the effect of boundary constraint on damage competition and compression after impact (CAI) strength of composite honeycomb sandwich structures considering different impact positions. The offset distance from the center point (ODC) was utilized to quantify the effect of boundary constraint. Four impact positions and three impact energies during impact experimental testing are considered and discussed. In addition, the typical mechanical characteristics including peak force, energy absorption, and deformation modes are compared. The results show that the effect of boundary constraint leads to a further reduction in CAI strength compared to that at center point impact position. At the impact energy of 20 J, the CAI strength (85.70 MPa) of 20 J-40 mm is nearly 26.69 MPa lower than that (112.39 MPa) of 20 J-0 mm, a ratio of about 23.74%. Based on boundary effect, the impact region can be divided into two regions: affected region and non-affected region, and the CAI strength showed a significant decline after ODC was 20 mm. In addition, the finite element model is established to reveal the impact behavior and damage competition mechanism. The bending stiffness of specimen increases with ODC increases, resulting in more impact energy being converted into plastic rather than elastic deformation. Besides, the phenomenon that the number of matrix damages of the specimen decreases and the number of fiber damages increases is also observed. These findings highlight the effect of boundary constraints into damage tolerant design for aerospace applications. © 2025","CAI strength; Composite; Damage mechanism; Impact behavior; Sandwich structure","Aerospace applications; Damage detection; Damage tolerance; Failure (mechanical); Fits and tolerances; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Impact testing; Structural design; 'current; Boundary constraints; Boundary effects; Center points; Compression-after-impact strengths; Damage mechanism; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact behavior; Impact energy; Impact positions; Composite materials; Sandwich structures","Karsandik, Yasin, Impact behavior of sandwich composites for aviation applications: A review, Composite Structures, 314, (2023); undefined; Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Quanjin, Ma, A review of the recent trends on core structures and impact response of sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 55, 18, pp. 2513-2555, (2021); Deng, Yunfei, Research on the low-velocity impact performance of composite sandwich structure with curved-crease origami foldcore, Thin-Walled Structures, 174, (2022); Ma, Zhe, Multiple impacts behavior of Nomex honeycomb sandwich structures with elastomer-enhanced CFRP skins, Thin-Walled Structures, 216, (2025); Pan, Xin, Experimental and numerical study on the low-velocity impact response of thermoplastic composite corrugated sandwich panels, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 4, pp. 1828-1846, (2022); Cai, Wei, Experimental and analytical investigations on single and repetitive impact failure responses of composite sandwich panels with orthogonal woven GFRP facesheets and PVC foam cores, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 194, (2024); Wang, Xiaochen, Study on bending-after-impact performance of composite sandwich structural batteries, Thin-Walled Structures, 213, (2025); Ma, Wanhui, Damage behavior of composite honeycomb sandwich structure subject to low-velocity impact and compression-after-impact using experimental and numerical methods, Thin-Walled Structures, 205, (2024)",""

The results show that the wavy hexachiral sandwich panel absorbs the most amount of impact energy and transmits the lowest forces and stresses to the protected surface. This superior performance is induced due to the deformation characteristics of the wavy hexachiral structure, where an in-plane isotropic auxetic effect is activated across a wider impacted region and over a larger deformation range, as compared to other two core designs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic; Blast loading; Hexachiral structure; Negative Poisson ratio; Sandwich panel","Dynamic loads; Poisson ratio; Sandwich structures; Structural panels; Auxetics; Blast loading; Blast loads; Core layers; Deformation Characteristics; Hexachiral structure; Modeling parameters; Negative Poisson ratio; Performance; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Radford, Darren D., The response of clamped sandwich plates with metallic foam cores to simulated blast loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 43, 7-8, pp. 2243-2259, (2006); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of double-layer rectangular sandwich plates with metal foam cores subjected to blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 122, pp. 265-275, (2018); Xu, Pengzhao, Experimental and Numerical Study on Dynamic Response of Foam-Nickel Sandwich Panels under Near-Field Blast Loading, Materials, 16, 16, (2023); Zhang, Wei, The influence of asymmetric faces on low-velocity impact failure of CFRP/aluminum foam composite sandwich beams, Engineering Structures, 292, (2023); Sun, Guangyong, Dynamic response of sandwich panel with hierarchical honeycomb cores subject to blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 142, pp. 499-515, (2019); Shirbhate, Payal A., Investigation of effect of perforations in honeycomb sandwich structure for enhanced blast load mitigation, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 17, pp. 3463-3478, (2023); Cui, Xiaodong, Dynamic response of metallic lattice sandwich structures to impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 1-5, (2012); Li, Jianfeng, Internal blast resistance of sandwich cylinder with lattice cores, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 191, (2021); Du, Mingkun, Response of Topological Soliton lattice structures subjected to dynamic compression and blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 188, (2023); Zhang, Pan, Experimental and numerical investigations on laser-welded corrugated-core sandwich panels subjected to air blast loading, Marine Structures, 40, pp. 225-246, (2015)",""

This framework makes it possible to generate models with different levels of refinement, ranging from simplified to fully detailed descriptions. If the total structure is considered as a single layer, the Equivalent-Single Layer (ESL) is employed; if the skins and core are considered as components, the Layer-Wise (LW) is used; finally, the actual geometry of the core can be considered, along with the skin, leading to the Component-Wise (CW) approach. The research aims to assess the impact of the simplifications inherent in the ESL and LW models on the accuracy of modal predictions relative to the more detailed CW approach. A benchmark case is analysed, and its natural frequencies and mode shapes are computed using all three approaches and compared with results obtained from commercial two- and tree-dimensional finite elements. The outcomes reveal that although the ESL and LW models are computationally efficient and can capture the global deformation of the structure, they fail to address local effects, which are accurately predicted by the CW model. The latter, hence, is necessary to provide precise information about the dynamic behaviour of the honeycomb sandwich structure. In particular, Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) values between the modes of the skins assessed by means of LW and CW, show that even if a global mode shape can be well represented by LW, local effects can only be detected by CW approach. This difference introduce an underestimation in the evaluated frequencies, which achieves -19 % and -10 % in case of bending and torsional modes within the first ten modes, respectively. Given the widespread use of honeycomb sandwich panels in aerospace structures for their high stiffness-to-weight ratio and vibro-acoustic insulation properties, the results underline the importance of adopting refined CW-based CUF models whenever accurate predictions of the dynamic response are required. © 2025 The Author(s)","CUF; FEM; Modal analysis; Sandwich; Structural modelling","Dynamic response; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural panels; Vibration analysis; Carrera's Unified Formulation; Component wise; Equivalent single-layer; Free-vibration analysis; Layer wise models; Layer-wise; Local effects; Mode shapes; Sandwich; Structural modeling; Modal analysis","Chandrasekaran, Navin Kumar, State-of-the-art review on honeycomb sandwich composite structures with an emphasis on filler materials, Polymer Composites, 42, 10, pp. 5011-5020, (2021); Kee Paik, Jeom, Strength characteristics of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 35, 3, pp. 205-231, (1999); Al-Khazraji, Mustafa S., Composite sandwich structures: review of manufacturing techniques, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 22, 5, pp. 1616-1636, (2024); Sun, Zhi, On compressive properties of composite sandwich structures with grid reinforced honeycomb core, Composites Part B: Engineering, 94, pp. 245-252, (2016); Zhao, Xuan, Bending response and energy absorption of sandwich beams with novel auxetic honeycomb core, Engineering Structures, 247, (2021); Gai, Xiaoling, Acoustic properties of honeycomb like sandwich acoustic metamaterials, Applied Acoustics, 199, (2022); Tahmasbi, Vahid, Thermal analysis of honeycomb sandwich panels as substrate of ablative heat shield, Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer, 32, 1, pp. 129-140, (2018); Ruzzene, Massimo, Vibration and sound radiation of sandwich beams with honeycomb truss core, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 277, 4-5, pp. 741-763, (2004); Wang, Le, Structural damage detection using cross correlation functions of vibration response, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 329, 24, pp. 5070-5086, (2010); Namazinia, Nima, Free vibration and static analysis of sandwich composite plate with auxetic core and GPLRC facing sheets in hygrothermal environment, Forces in Mechanics, 15, (2024)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

However, the in-plane dynamic performance of curved hexagonal honeycombs has not been adequately investigated. This study investigates the in-plane compressive behavior of advanced arc-walled hexagonal honeycombs, characterized by additional arc walls and lens-shaped cavities. Finite element models were developed to evaluate the in-plane compressive performance of the proposed honeycombs subjected to in-plane compression. Parametric study was performed to examine the effects of impact velocity, wall thickness, and arc angle on the mechanical behavior of the proposed honeycombs. Three deformation modes, “X”, “V”, and “I”, were identified at low, moderate and high velocities. Plateau stress and energy absorption capacity were improved with the increase in the impact velocity and wall thickness. The arc angle also showed an enhancement effect on the plateau stress, energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA), particularly as it increased from 0° to 60°. Based on the repeatable collapsing mechanism used by Hu and Yu, a theoretical analysis was performed to evaluate the plateau stress of the proposed honeycombs subjected to in-plane compression at high velocities with an average discrepancy of 8.12 %. The incorporation of arc walls in hexagonal honeycombs demonstrates enhanced plateau stress, EA, and SEA, with improvement ratios of up to 172 %, 152 %, and 41 %, respectively, relative to the traditional design. These improvements arise from the additional arch walls which generate lens-shaped cavities, which, despite adding mass, offer superior performance compared to the traditional honeycomb under dynamic compression at high velocities. © 2025 The Author(s)","Arc-walled hexagonal honeycomb; Crushing stress; Deformation mode; Dynamic response; Energy absorption","Dynamics; Stresses; Arc-walled hexagonal honeycomb; Crushing stress; Deformation modes; Energy; Energy absorption capacity; Hexagonal honeycomb; High velocity; Impact velocities; In-plane compression; Plateau stress; Dynamic response; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Dutta, Ananta, A novel method of fabricating aluminium honeycomb core by friction stir welding, Thin-Walled Structures, 193, (2023); Zeng, Chengjun, Compression behavior and energy absorption of 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composite honeycomb structures with shape memory effects, Additive Manufacturing, 38, (2021); Gao, Xu, Experimental and numerical investigation of thermoplastic honeycomb sandwich structures under bending loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 155, (2020); Özen, İsmail, Low-energy impact response of composite sandwich panels with thermoplastic honeycomb and reentrant cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 156, (2020); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing strength of hexagonal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 467-474, (2010); Liu, Yifan, Quasi cross-scale effect on composite auxetic honeycomb sandwich structures subjected to dynamic loadings, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 203, (2025); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Niu, Xiaoqiang, In-plane dynamic crashing behavior and energy absorption of novel bionic honeycomb structures, Composite Structures, 299, (2022); Liu, Jiefu, In-plane crushing behaviors of hexagonal honeycombs with different Poisson's ratio induced by topological diversity, Thin-Walled Structures, 159, (2021); Pehlivan, Levent, In-plane crushing behavior and energy absorption of CFRP honeycombs with different core topologies, Thin-Walled Structures, 205, (2024)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

While prior mechanical studies have focused exclusively on the 13-sided “hat” version, the six-sided semi re-entrant variant remains largely untapped, despite its geometric similarity to classical energy-absorbing lattices. In this study, we design, 3D print, simulate, and compare periodic and aperiodic lattices constructed entirely from the same semi re-entrant Einstein monotile. This one-to-one comparison fills a key research gap by isolating the mechanical role of aperiodicity without introducing changes in unit geometry or relative density. The TPU-based auxetic, zero, and positive Poisson's ratio honeycombs are tested under in-plane compression and bending. Validated by experiments, finite element simulations are used to capture deformation mechanisms, stress-strain response, Poisson's ratio evolution, and energy absorption behavior. Results show that the aperiodic lattices outperform their periodic counterparts across both loading modes. Under compression, the aperiodic lattices (with a 6 × 8 patch size) exhibit irregular collapse bands resulting in up to 40 % higher specific energy absorption (SEA). Under bending, they demonstrate 12–13 % higher SEA at large deflections, while maintaining comparable stiffness. Although the effective modulus of the aperiodic lattices is slightly lower (by up to 14 %), this reduction is offset by smoother load evolution and more progressive failure. These findings demonstrate the potential of aperiodic ordering as a design strategy for mechanical metamaterials and introduce the semi re-entrant Einstein monotile as a building block for impact-mitigating lattice systems with applications in civil and automotive industries. © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS","Aperiodic but ordered; Aperiodicity; Auxetic honeycombs; Compression; Monotile; Three-point bending","Energy absorption; Poisson ratio; Stress analysis; Structural design; Aperiodic but ordered; Aperiodic lattices; Aperiodicity; Auxetic honeycomb; Auxetics; Compression; Energy; Mechanical; Monotile; Three-points bending; Honeycomb structures","Álvarez-Trejo, Alberto, Mechanical metamaterials with topologies based on curved elements: An overview of design, additive manufacturing and mechanical properties, Materials and Design, 233, (2023); Bahmanpour, Ehsan, Flexural behaviors of asymmetric Re-entrant auxetic honeycombs, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 109, (2025); Becker, Adam M., Percolation thresholds on two-dimensional Voronoi networks and Delaunay triangulations, Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics, 80, 4, (2009); Bordiga, Giovanni, Automated discovery of reprogrammable nonlinear dynamic metamaterials, Nature Materials, 23, 11, pp. 1486-1494, (2024); Carneiro, Vítor Hugo Pimenta, On the elastic properties of three-dimensional honeycomb lattices, Composites Communications, 17, pp. 14-17, (2020); Castañeda, Fahir D., Design for the additive manufacturing of structural elements with cellular materials using Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations: Biological and structural applications, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 27, pp. 9550-9570, (2024); Chen, Yuwen, In-plane compression characteristics of star-shaped honeycomb with asymmetric cells, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 105, (2024); Clarke, Daniel John, An isotropic zero Poisson's ratio metamaterial based on the aperiodic ‘hat’ monotile, Applied Materials Today, 35, (2023); Clarke, Daniel John, Identification of mechanically representative samples for aperiodic honeycombs, Materials Today Communications, 38, (2024); Deng, Junjie, Design and optimization for honeycomb-like structures with hybridizing hierarchy and gradient strategies, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 32, 23, pp. 5894-5908, (2025)",""

In contrast, re-entrant honeycomb structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) offer excellent impact resistance and energy absorption capabilities. In this study, a novel SA-grade F-shaped composite crashworthy guardrail was proposed by embedding a re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb structure as an energy-absorbing layer to enhance crash energy dissipation. The accuracy of the finite element (FE) model for the proposed guardrail was validated through quasi-static compression tests on 3D-printed honeycomb specimens, showing good agreement with the simulation results. The applicability of the vehicle FE models was confirmed in accordance with relevant safety standards. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to optimize the honeycomb structure configuration, including geometric design, material selection, and cell wall thickness. A comprehensive crashworthiness evaluation was then performed under various vehicle–guardrail collision scenarios following the specification requirements. The results demonstrate that, compared to the F-shaped guardrail, the proposed design reduces the peak impact forces by 15.1%, 25.2%, and 26.7% for passenger car, bus, and truck, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in cushioning performance.

However, the cellular geometric configuration of honeycombs combined with the large-scale characteristics of infrastructures inevitably leads to excessive mesh quantities in finite element models, resulting in prohibitively low efficiency during iterative design processes. The solid-equivalent model is a substitute for refined hexagonal-cell model. While existing equivalent models demonstrate satisfactory simulation accuracy under uniaxial stress states, they exhibit critical limitations in complex stress scenarios, e.g. distorted deformation patterns and excessive structural stiffness. This study proposes a modified solid-equivalent modeling approach through activation of higher-order yield surface functions. By conducting stress tests under orthogonal principal direction and multi-angle non-uniaxial compression tests on honeycomb structures, the parameters for higher-order yield functions in equivalent models are systematically determined. Furthermore, the influence of solid element types on deformation distortion control is investigated, leading to optimized element selection for improved accuracy. The computational precision of the modified equivalent model is validated through non-uniform quasi-static compression tests on honeycomb-grid composites and drop-weight impact tests on honeycomb-grid sandwich structures simulating fender configurations. For bridge anti-collision design applications, a high efficiency design workflow is established, comprising three key phases: 1) design domain determination based on bow geometric profiles, 2) parametric preliminary selection through equivalent solid modeling and crashworthiness evaluation, and 3) energy principle-based parametric design verification. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Collision fender; Crashworthiness; Energy based design method; Honeycomb; Solid-equivalent model","Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Iterative methods; Sandwich structures; Structural design; Yield stress; Anti collision; Collision fender; Design method; Energy based design method; Energy-based design; Equivalent modeling; High-order; Higher-order; Honeycomb; Solid-equivalent model; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures","Fan, Wei, Vessel-bridge Collisions: Accidents, Analysis, and Protection, Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport, 37, 5, pp. 38-66, (2024); Yao, Ruyang, On the crashworthiness of thin-walled multi-cell structures and materials: State of the art and prospects, Thin-Walled Structures, 189, (2023); Zhang, Yong, Load characteristics of triangular honeycomb structures with self-similar hierarchical features, Engineering Structures, 257, (2022); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Wang, Zhonggang, Numerical and theoretical analysis of honeycomb structure filled with circular aluminum tubes subjected to axial compression, Composites Part B: Engineering, 165, pp. 626-635, (2019); Steenackers, Gunther, Development of an Equivalent Composite Honeycomb Model: A Finite Element Study, Applied Composite Materials, 23, 6, pp. 1177-1194, (2016); undefined; Xiao, Peng, Optimal design of composite sandwich panel with auxetic reentrant honeycomb using asymptotic equivalent model and PSO algorithm, Composite Structures, 328, (2024); Huang, Li, Analytical homogenization for equivalent in-plane elastic moduli of multi-material honeycombs, Composite Structures, 325, (2023); Tornabene, Francesco, Equivalent layer-wise theory for the hygro-thermo-magneto-electro-elastic analysis of laminated curved shells, Thin-Walled Structures, 198, (2024)",""

As velocity increases, CRSH transitions from a five-stage deformation mode to a four-stage mode, and finally to a three-stage mode. Theoretical models were developed to predict two plateau stresses under low-velocity impacts and one plateau stress under high-velocity impacts, showing good agreement with the simulated results. Compared with geometrically equivalent circular-reinforced quadrilateral honeycomb (CRQH) and SH, CRSH exhibits a strong auxetic effect, more stable plateau stresses, and higher specific energy absorption (SEA). Under low-velocity impacts, CRSH shows 70.14 % higher SEA than CRQH and 131.01 % than SH. This advantage persists at medium velocities, with SEA exceeding CRQH by 26.09 % and SH by 110.92 %, and even at high velocities, CRSH maintains a 24.43 % advantage over SH. Parametric analyses reveal that reducing a¯ while increasing t¯[jls-end-space/] and r¯[jls-end-space/] can optimize SEA, ensuring CRSH’s competitiveness under high-velocity impacts. Its tunable impact performance and multi-plateau mechanism make CRSH particularly well-suited for adaptive energy absorption applications in aerospace, automotive safety, and defense systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates a novel star-shaped honeycomb structure (SITH), formed by replacing the inclined edges of conventional star-shaped honeycombs (SSH) with isosceles triangular elements. The research focuses on the multiple plateau stress responses of the SITH under dynamic impact loading from different in-plane directions, as well as the effect of wall-thickness gradient strategies on improving energy absorption performance. Methods: Finite element models were validated against quasi-static compression experiments to ensure accuracy. Subsequently, the deformation patterns and crushing behaviors of SITH were analyzed under low-, medium-, and high-speed loading conditions. To enhance energy absorption, three wall-thickness configurations-uniform, positive gradient, and negative gradient-were compared. Results: Under low-speed loading, the SITH exhibited three plateau stresses along the Y-axis and two along the X-axis. Compared with SSH, the specific energy absorption (SEA) of SITH-Y and SITH-X increased by 46.15% and 50.96%, respectively. Across all loading speeds, the SITH demonstrated superior mechanical properties and energy absorption capacity. Furthermore, gradient wall-thickness designs in the Y-axis direction, whether positive or negative, further improved energy absorption efficiency. Conclusion: This study highlights the unique multi-plateau stress behavior and enhanced energy absorption capability of the SITH. It also confirms that wall-thickness gradient designs provide an effective approach to further improving performance, offering new insights for the development of high-performance lightweight energy-absorbing structures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Enhanced energy absorption; Gradient honeycombs; Impact; Multi-plateau stress; Reinforced honeycomb structures","","Hubballi, Siddalingappa S., Experimental Investigation of Pounding Responses in Longer Structures at Expansion Gap, Journal of Vibration Engineering and Technologies, 12, 2, pp. 1707-1723, (2024); Zhi, Guoliang, Investigation of Structure-Borne Noise Propagation Characteristics in a Novel Double-Story High-Speed Railway Station, Journal of Vibration Engineering and Technologies, 12, 3, pp. 5325-5344, (2024); Xie, Zhongyou, Bending crashworthiness of thin-walled square tubes with multi-cell and double-tube cross-sections, Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology, 35, 11, pp. 4815-4823, (2021); Xie, Zhongyou, Modeling the deformation of thin-walled circular tubes filled with metallic foam under two lateral loading patterns, Structures, 69, (2024); Xie, Zhongyou, FILLET EFFECT ON THE BENDING CRASHWORTHINESS OF THIN-WALLED SQUARE TUBES, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 60, 1, pp. 103-111, (2022); Xie, Zhongyou, Analyses on bending crashworthiness of thin-walled circular tubes reinforced with internal triangular stiffeners, Structural Engineering and Mechanics, 93, 1, pp. 55-64, (2025); Rivera, Jesus, Modulation of impact energy dissipation in biomimetic helicoidal composites, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 9, 6, pp. 14619-14629, (2020); Yu, Yue, Relaxation and mixed mode oscillations in a shape memory alloy oscillator driven by parametric and external excitations, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 140, (2020); Ma, Jiayue, A Novel Monitoring Method of Wind-Induced Vibration and Stability of Long-Span Bridges Based on Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Technology, Sensors, 25, 11, (2025); Wang, Guifeng, Lightweight self-similar hierarchical metamaterials with subwavelength and superwide bandgaps, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 280, (2024)",""

They have a fundamental property as an energy absorber; in this type of absorber, negative stiffness causes reversibility after impact. In this study, the effect of negative stiffness honeycomb material in increasing energy absorption is investigated experimentally and numerically. Quasi-static tests are performed on negative stiffness honeycombs made of polyamide 11 (PA11) and polyamide 12 (PA12). Then, the finite element (FE) model of the structure is simulated under quasi-static compression. The FE model requires the nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic properties of the materials used to make the honeycombs. For this purpose, tensile and stress relaxation tests are performed. The Prony series coefficients for polyamide materials 11 and 12 are extracted and used in the FE model. Next, the energy absorption performance of negative stiffness honeycombs of PA11 and PA12 is compared experimentally and numerically. The comparison shows that the energy absorption per unit mass (SEA) for a negative stiffness honeycomb made of PA11 is 1.7 times higher in the experimental data and 1.62 times higher in the FE result than negative stiffness honeycomb made of PA12. Other fundamental parameters of energy absorption also confirm the higher efficiency of negative stiffness honeycombs made of PA11. This study provides a unique contribution by integrating experimentally determined nonlinear viscoelastic properties into the FE model and offering a comparison of energy absorption performance between PA11 and PA12 in negative stiffness honeycombs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Energy absorption; Negative stiffness honeycomb; Polyamide; Snap through","Energy efficiency; Energy transition; Polyamides; Stiffness; Viscoelasticity; Absorption performance; Energy; Energy absorbers; Finite element modelling (FEM); Negative stiffness; Negative stiffness honeycomb; Nonlinear visco-elastic; Poly-amide 12; Polyamide-11; Snap-through; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Abbasi, Ali A., Application of hyperelastic models in mechanical properties prediction of mouse oocyte and embryo cells at large deformations, Scientia Iranica, 25, 2B, pp. 700-710, (2018); Alomarah, Amer, Out-of-plane compressive properties of a butterfly-shaped auxetic metamaterial, Smart Materials and Structures, 33, 11, (2024); Alomarah, Amer, Compressive properties of a modified re-entrant chiral auxetic structure (MRCA) under uniaxial quasi-static loading, Smart Materials and Structures, 33, 5, (2024); Andrzejewska-Sroka, Angela Jadwiga, Tensile and Fatigue Behavior of Additive Manufactured Polylactide, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 6, 5, pp. 272-280, (2019); Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics, (2025); Standard Test Methods for Stress Relaxation for Materials and Structures, (2013); Bahrami, Mohsen, Comparative characterization of hot-pressed polyamide 11 and 12: Mechanical, thermal and durability properties, Polymers, 13, 20, (2021); Pacheco, Juliana E.Lopes, Viscoelastic relaxation modulus characterization using Prony series, Latin American Journal of Solids and Structures, 12, 2, pp. 420-445, (2015); Chae, Seung-hyun, Characterization of the Viscoelasticity of Molding Compounds in the Time Domain, Journal of Electronic Materials, 39, 4, pp. 419-425, (2010); Chen, Shuai, A novel gradient negative stiffness honeycomb for recoverable energy absorption, Composites Part B: Engineering, 215, (2021)",""

To address these challenges, we develop a mortise-and-tenon modular discrete auxetic honeycomb (MDAH-MT) which enables scalable fabrication and structural reconfigurability. In this work, we investigate the plateau stress — a key indicator of crashworthiness — of the MDAH-MT through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Based on the underlying deformation mechanisms and the energy method, theoretical models of the plateau stresses under quasi-static compression, low- and high-velocity impacts are established. Finite element (FE) simulations validate these models, showing good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The crashworthiness and structural stability of the MDAH-MT are further evaluated, revealing that it not only provides effective energy absorption but also exhibits superior self-locking stability and transmits lower forces to the protected object compared with other modular discrete energy-absorbing structures.

Simulations demonstrated that higher honeycombs (40 mm) exhibited superior energy absorption and lower maximum deceleration compared to lower ones (20 mm), while excessively thick walls resulted in higher maximum deceleration.

Conventional honeycomb designs are often limited by poor deformation stability and localized stress concentrations, which restrict their energy absorption efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel biomechanically inspired helicoidal honeycomb sandwich structure (HS) that integrates Bouligand architecture with rounded-corner design, fabricated via 3D printing. The mechanical response of HS was systematically investigated by experiments and finite element simulations under varying helicoidal angles (0°–360°) and corner radii (0, 5, and 10 mm). Results reveal that larger helicoidal angles sacrifice strength and stiffness but promote deformation stability and smoother stress–strain plateaus, while rounded corners (R = 10 mm) effectively improve stress distribution and load-bearing capacity. The optimized configuration (θ = 360°, R = 10 mm) achieves a 184 % improvement in specific energy absorption compared to conventional counterparts. Mechanism analysis demonstrates a unique three-phase deformation process—flexible yielding, stable deformation, and multi-point energy absorption—attributed to the synergistic effect of helicoidal geometry and corner optimization.

While conventional aluminum honeycomb devices achieve high specific energy absorption, they suffer from complex fabrication, require full replacement after minor impacts, and generate high rebound velocities that can exacerbate secondary damage. In this study, we propose a Multi-layered Nested Tubular Structure (MNTS)—an arrangement of adjustable square and circular thin-walled tubes—as an alternative absorber. A physics–based finite‐element (FE) model, incorporating material nonlinearity, simulates a lead‐car collision against a rigid wall and is validated against full-scale experiments (velocity: 8.357 m/s; mass: 54 t). The model accurately reproduces peak absorbed energy, average force response, displacement history, and rebound velocity. A parametric study of 144 FE simulations combined with response surface methodology identifies optimal wall‐thickness parameters (λ<inf>s</inf> = 7.4 mm, λ<inf>c</inf> = 18.6 mm), yielding a maximum energy absorption of 1.728 MJ (R<inf>MSE</inf> = 0.0477 MJ, R² = 0.945). Building on these results, we develop a reduced‐order analytical model using logistic regression to relate train speed (5.0–9.0 m/s) to peak force, maximum displacement, and energy absorption, achieving an R² of 0.989 for displacement predictions. Validation against 41 additional FE runs confirms the analytical model's accuracy while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Compared with honeycomb absorbers, the MNTS matches energy-absorption efficiency yet significantly lowers peak impact forces and rebound velocities, thereby enhancing passenger safety. Together, the validated FE framework and its streamlined analytical counterpart constitute a rapid, practical design and assessment tool for train collision energy-absorption systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Collision; Energy absorption device; Simplified model; Thin-walled structures; Train","Analytical models; Derailments; Energy absorption; Energy efficiency; Honeycomb structures; Logistic regression; Structural design; Walls (structural partitions); Collision; Energy; Energy absorption device; Multi-layered; Optimization design; Rebound velocity; Simplified model; Thin-walled structures; Train; Tubular structures; Thin walled structures","Chen, Jun, Evaluation of the anti-collision performance of reinforced concrete protective wall for railway bridges under high-speed train impact, Engineering Failure Analysis, 182, (2025); Peng, Yong, Study on the collision performance of a composite energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 94, pp. 663-672, (2015); undefined; undefined, (2018); Qiu, Kunxian, Study on the cutting force in machining of aluminum honeycomb core material, Composite Structures, 164, pp. 58-67, (2017); Chen, Daiheng, Crush Mechanics of Thin-Walled Tubes, pp. 1-325, (2015); Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Transition from initial global bending to progressive buckling of tubes loaded statically and dynamically, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 19, 5-6, pp. 415-437, (1997); Li, Yuru, Energy Absorption Characteristics and Parameter Optimization of Anti-Climb Energy-Absorbing Devices for Subway Vehicles under Impact Loads, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2024); Chen, Dongdong, On Crashworthiness and Energy-Absorbing Mechanisms of Thick CFRP Structures for Railway Vehicles, Polymers, 14, 22, (2022); Wang, Dongtao, Crashworthiness performance of gradient energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles under quasi-static loading, Electronic Research Archive, 31, 6, pp. 3568-3593, (2023)",""

The mechanical and energy absorption properties, compression response, deformation mode, interlayer energy absorption, structural stability, and structural efficiency of CAWS were investigated by finite element analysis and experiment, compared with the similar morphology and function of Polyurethane foam (Polyurethane) and Solid. CAWS exhibited 1.71 and 2.38 times higher total energy absorption and Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) compared to Polyurethane, and its Specific Stress (SS) exceeded those of Polyurethane and Solid by 5.29 and 13.07 times, respectively. CAWS exhibited uniform and progressive deformation modes with distinct “V” and “U” mode transformations throughout the elastic-plastic and plastic stages. The symmetry of the engineering strain Eyy, detected through Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques. Due to the grouping effect, energy transmission within CAWS exhibited regular circumferential and radial patterns. Finally, the effects of relative density (n) and impact velocity on the performance of CAWS were analyzed.

However, due to irreversible deformation and abrupt acceleration changes during the buffering process, it fails to meet reusability and compliant buffering requirements. Additionally, star table detectors have short landing times, typically completing buffering and energy absorption within 1 s. Therefore, this study employs a PZT-driven reusable buffering mechanism for rapid response. The mechanical structure converts linear impact motion into rotational motion via a large lead screw nut, enabling bidirectional movement with a compact, lightweight design. Dynamic responses under varying impact forces were analyzed using finite element impact dynamics, revealing relationships among structural deformation, stress, strain, and impact force. The reasoning system based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural networks compensates for control lag. Buffering experiments at landing velocities of 2, 3, and 4 m/s showed maximum reverse accelerations of 1.94, 2.04, and 2.13 m/s², and experimental accelerations of 2.59, 2.73, and 2.97 m/s², respectively.

As such, they are reported in literature to be promising options for impact mitigation in military and space contexts. Auxetic materials are rare in nature, and must therefore be designed and manufactured artificially in order to be applied. Densification of auxetic materials in order to absorb impact energy in a limited area has been the focus in the literature to date. However, this results in a concentration of the force paths, which is not desirable for impact mitigation. In this work, the effects of auxetic densification on the stress distribution over the backside of the auxetic material are addressed using both experimental and simulative trials. In this study, the distinction between auxetic and conventional honeycombs in force transmission characteristics is examined.

The current research has focused on adjusting spoke structures to improve the single performance of NPT. Few studies have been conducted to synergistically improve multi-performance by optimizing the spoke structure. Inspired by the concept of functionally gradient structures, this paper introduces a functionally gradient honeycomb NPT and its optimization method. Firstly, this paper completes the parameterization of the honeycomb spoke structure and establishes the numerical models of honeycomb NPTs with seven different gradients. Subsequently, the accuracy of the numerical models is verified using experimental methods. Then, the static and dynamic characteristics of these gradient honeycomb NPTs are thoroughly examined by using the finite element method. The findings highlight that the gradient structure of NPT-3 has superior performance. Building upon this, the study investigates the effects of key parameters, such as honeycomb spoke thickness and length, on load-carrying capacity, honeycomb spoke stress and mass. Finally, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed that uses a response surface model (RSM) and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm - II (NSGA-II) to further optimize the functional gradient honeycomb NPTs. The optimized NPT-OP shows a 23.48% reduction in radial stiffness, 8.95% reduction in maximum spoke stress and 16.86% reduction in spoke mass compared to the initial NPT-1. The damping characteristics of the NPT-OP have also been improved. The results offer a theoretical foundation and technical methodology for the structural design and optimization of gradient honeycomb NPTs. © The Author(s) 2025.","Gradient structure; Honeycomb structure; Multi-objective optimization; Non-pneumatic tires","Dynamic response; Model structures; Multiobjective optimization; % reductions; Functional gradient; Functionally gradient; Gradient structure; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-pneumatic tires; Optimization method; Performance; Performances analysis; Spoke structure; Honeycomb structures","Zang, Liguo, Investigation on mechanical characteristics of non-pneumatic tire with rhombus structure under complex pavement conditions, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 116, (2022); Deng, Yaoji, A comprehensive review on non-pneumatic tyre research, Materials and Design, 227, (2023); Liu, Weidong, Static Stiffness Properties of High Load Capacity Non-Pneumatic Tires with Different Tread Structures, Lubricants, 11, 4, (2023); Rugsaj, Ravivat, Proper Radial Spokes of Non-Pneumatic Tire for Vertical Load Supporting by Finite Element Analysis, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 20, 4, pp. 801-812, (2019); Zhang, Zifeng, Comparative Analysis of Static and Dynamic Performance of Nonpneumatic Tire with Flexible Spoke Structure, Strojniski Vestnik/Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 66, 7-8, pp. 458-466, (2020); Bras, Bert A., Life-Cycle Environmental Impact of Michelin Tweel® Tire for Passenger Vehicles, SAE International Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems, 4, 1, pp. 32-43, (2011); Kumar, Anand Suresh, Force and moment characteristics of a rhombi tessellated non-pneumatic tire, Tire Science and Technology, 44, 2, pp. 130-148, (2016); Int J Sci Res Sci Technol, (2018); Deng, Yaoji, The Influence of Nonlinear Stiffness of Novel Flexible Road Wheel on Ride Comfort of Tracked Vehicle Traversing Random Uneven Road, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 165293-165302, (2019); Int J Eng Sci, (2016)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

To address this limitation, a novel cement-based composite reinforced with 3D-printed honeycomb structures is presented. The dynamic compressive behaviour and damage evolution of composites featuring three distinct cell sizes (6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm) were systematically investigated across varying strain rates. Mechanical testing characterized dynamic strength, fracture energy, and failure modes, supplemented by finite element simulations elucidating damage mechanisms. Results demonstrate a significant strain-rate strengthening effect, with both dynamic compressive strength and fracture energy increasing markedly with strain rate. Honeycomb reinforcement substantially enhanced dynamic performance, with cell size critically determining the effect. Specimens with the smallest cell size (6 mm, L6-CC group) exhibited optimal properties, achieving 35.03 %–44.03 % higher dynamic compressive strength and 54.78 %–136.17 % greater fracture energy compared to unreinforced controls. The high-density cell-wall network of small-cell honeycombs effectively dispersed stress and suppressed crack propagation, thereby enhancing mechanical performance and energy absorption. Furthermore, the honeycomb structure inhibited matrix fragmentation, maintained excellent structural integrity under low strain rates, and, through plastic deformation and progressive failure, effectively suppressed damage evolution and delayed macroscopic crack growth.

Mechanical and acoustic test specimens were fabricated using three-dimensional printing, and three-point bending and impedance tube experiments were conducted. The bending and sound absorption performances of the RHRS were assessed by performing a combination of theoretical analyses, experimental tests, and numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical design and finite element model. The results revealed that compared with the two conventional honeycomb structures, the RHRS exhibited enhanced bending performance, with a specific energy absorption increase of 10.79–14.42 % when the resonator cells were positioned on the non-load-bearing side. In terms of sound absorption, the resonance frequencies observed in the theoretical, experimental, and simulation results showed excellent consistency, confirming the efficacy of the RHRS in noise reduction. Although variations in the resonator dimensions had minimal impact on the mechanical performance, the acoustic resonance frequency increased with the neck tube diameter and decreased with the neck tube length. The coupling effect of multi-RHRSs expanded the sound absorption bandwidth to 632–771 Hz, and the sound absorption mechanism of the RHRS was analyzed using relative impedance. The RHRS demonstrated promising mechanical properties and can be further optimized for noise reduction within specific frequency ranges; thus, it offers valuable insights into the design and application of multifunctional structures. © 2025","Bending performance; Helmholtz resonator; Multifunctional structure; Negative-Poisson's-ratio sandwich structure; Sound absorption","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic resonators; Bending moments; Bending strength; Bending tests; Light absorption; Model structures; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Ultrasonic absorption; Bending performance; Helmholtz resonators; Mechanical; Multifunctional structures; Negative Poisson ratio; Negative-poisson-ratio sandwich structure; Resonance frequencies; Resonator structures; Rocket fairing; Sound absorption; Honeycomb structures","Dąbrowski, Adam, Preliminary results from HEDGEHOG REXUS project – A sounding rocket experiment on accelerations, vibrations and heat flow, Acta Astronautica, 177, pp. 80-85, (2020); Escartí-Guillem, Mara Salut, Deflector shape impact on aero-acoustic noise generation and propagation, Acta Astronautica, 213, pp. 385-391, (2023); Aerospace Engineering Review, (1944); undefined, (1997); Yang, Wei, On auxetic materials, Journal of Materials Science, 39, 10, pp. 3269-3279, (2004); Chen, C.

RC walls are vulnerable to low-velocity impact, such as the fall of components caused by earthquakes or explosions, for example, and the impact from road objects, such as vehicles, during their service life. When subjected to instantaneous high-energy impact, RC walls at key positions are prone to severe damage, which can further lead to structural collapse. Therefore, it is necessary to consider improving the impact resistance of key RC walls in a structure. Using a porous honeycomb structure with excellent energy absorption performance to provide impact protection for key RC walls is an effective way to reduce the damage of RC walls and thereby enhance the impact resistance of a structure. Therefore, based on the author’s previous series of experimental and numerical studies on the impact resistance of RC walls, as well as the high-mass pendulum impact experimental study on the honeycomb sandwich panel composite RC wall (HSP-RC wall), this paper adopts a multi-scale modelling method in micro-mechanics and macro-mechanics to establish a pendulum impact finite element model (FEM) for the HSP-RC wall. The representative volume element (RVE) and periodic boundary condition (PBC) are used to calculate the elastic property parameters of the honeycomb, which guide the establishment of the FEMs for the HSP-RC wall. The FEMs can avoid the computational difficulty caused by refined simulation, analyse the impact damage of the HSP-RC walls more accurately, quantify the impact protection effect of the honeycomb sandwich panel, and thus facilitate the parametric analysis of the impact resistance of HSP-RC walls with different honeycomb panel structural parameters in subsequent studies. © 2025 by the authors.","honeycomb sandwich panel; impact; protection effect; RC wall; RVE","Air transportation; Impact resistance; Pendulums; Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural panels; Walls (structural partitions); Air-defence; Building structure; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact; Impact protection; Impact resistance performance; Low velocity impact; Protection effect; Reinforced concrete wall; Representative volume elements; Honeycomb structures","Shi, Chenglong, Improving the Impact Resistance and Antisplash of Civil Air Defense Wall: Experiments and Finite-Element Simulation, Journal of Structural Engineering, 149, 2, (2023); Dancygier, Avraham N., Response of high performance concrete plates to impact of non-deforming projectiles, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 34, 11, pp. 1768-1779, (2007); Liu, Jian, Experimental and numerical studies of ultra-high performance concrete targets against high-velocity projectile impacts, Engineering Structures, 173, pp. 166-179, (2018); Sadraie, Hamid R., Dynamic performance of concrete slabs reinforced with steel and GFRP bars under impact loading, Engineering Structures, 191, pp. 62-81, (2019); Karim, Rizwan, Performance of fiber-reinforced concrete link slabs with embedded steel and GFRP rebars, Engineering Structures, 229, (2021); Kuhn, Tino, Behavior of RC-slabs under impact-loading, EPJ Web of Conferences, 94, (2015); Othman, Hesham, An experimental investigation on the effect of steel reinforcement on impact response of reinforced concrete plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 88, pp. 12-21, (2016); Yilmaz, T., Experimental Investigation of Impact Behaviour of RC Slab with Different Reinforcement Ratios, KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 24, 1, pp. 241-254, (2020); Radnić, Jure, Impact testing of RC slabs strengthened with CFRP strips, Composite Structures, 121, pp. 90-103, (2015); Guo, Hui, Study on protective performance of impact-resistant polyurea and its coated concrete under impact loading, Construction and Building Materials, 340, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Unlike conventional milling, which causes excessive heat generation through energy-intensive mechanisms like fiber pull-out and plastic deformation, UVAM utilizes high-frequency impact loads to promote material removal via brittle fracture. This process efficiently severs fibers and the fiber-matrix interface, generating fine debris and significantly reducing the heat input. An integrated experimental and numerical methodology was employed, using a finite element model developed in ABAQUS to simulate interfacial heat transfer, validated by comparative milling experiments. The results demonstrate that UVAM achieves a substantial reduction in both thermal and mechanical damage. At a feed rate of 60 mm/min, UVAM reduced the temperature transmitted to the aluminum honeycomb core by approximately 29% and core tearing damage by 25%. A further temperature reduction of 31% was observed at a lower feed rate of 40 mm/min, confirming that optimized parameters can enhance the process benefits. The study conclusively shows that UVAM is a superior strategy for improving the machining quality and integrity of thermally sensitive composite sandwich structures. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.","CFRP/aluminum honeycomb sandwich structure; Defect distribution; Finite element simulation; Thermo-mechanical coupling; Ultrasonic milling","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Failure (mechanical); Fibers; Heat transfer; Milling (machining); Sandwich structures; Temperature; Ultrasonic waves; Vibrations (mechanical); Aluminium honeycomb; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer/aluminum honeycomb sandwich structure; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Defect distribution; Finite elements simulation; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Thermo - mechanical couplings; Ultrasonic millings; Ultrasonic-vibration; Vibration assisted; Honeycomb structures","Neveu, Florian, The GAP methodology: A new way to design composite structures, Materials and Design, 172, (2019); Zhang, Wei, A comparison of structural collapse of fully clamped and simply supported hybrid composite sandwich beams with geometrically asymmetric face sheets, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Huo, Xintao, On low-velocity impact response of foam-core sandwich panels, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 181, (2020); Cheng, Yu, Simulation study on the anti-penetration performance and energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb aluminum sandwich structure, Composite Structures, 310, (2023); Ni, Can, Deformation and failure of asymmetric sandwich structures under low-velocity impact, Engineering Failure Analysis, 161, (2024); Gunasegeran, Muthukumaran, Investigation of quasi-static indentation on sandwich structure with GFRP face sheets and PLA bio-inspired core: Numerical and experimental study, Thin-Walled Structures, 184, (2023); Wu, Yinghan, Dynamic crash responses of bio-inspired aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 121, pp. 122-133, (2017); Özkan, Dervis, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Composite Materials, Their Characteristic Properties, Industrial Application Areas and Their Machinability, Advanced Structured Materials, 124, pp. 235-253, (2020); Liu, Yong, Comparative analysis of dynamic progressive failure of CFRPs using the scale-span and macroscopic modeling method in drilling, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 268, (2022); Ming, Weiwei, Modelling of the temperature distribution based on equivalent heat transfer theory and anisotropic characteristics of honeycomb core during milling of aluminum honeycomb core, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 115, 7-8, pp. 2097-2110, (2021)",""

Leveraging a space-filling design approach and 2D Voronoi technique, the GCC core features an in-plane density gradient optimized for impact resistance, achieved by strategically controlling site distributions via an orbital coordinate system. Quasi-static tensile tests and low-velocity impact experiments (100–200 J) were conducted on aluminum alloy CPSPs, complemented by validated the finite element analysis (FEA) model. Results demonstrate that the GCC core enables tunable relative density distributions by adjusting key parameters (site counts N<inf>1</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>, radius R, gradient exponent α). Compared to hexagonal honeycomb cores of equivalent mass, the GCC core exhibits superior specific energy absorption (SEA), reaching 3.14 kJ/kg at 200 J—over 60 % higher than conventional cores. Parametric study systematically investigated the influence of the key design parameters on the structure's impact performance.

The relevant finite element model is constructed using Abaqus/Explicit and validated against quasistatic compression experiments. A comparative analysis is initially conducted on the in-plane performance of ACECH structures with varying concave angles. The results show that increasing the concave angle significantly enhances the specific energy absorption (SEA): ACECH-80° exhibits a 17.83% improvement over ACECH-60°, while ACECH-90° shows a 36.31% enhancement. Further investigations are carried out to assess the effect of the circular node diameter R on the mechanical properties of ACECH-80° and ACECH-90°. The SEA of ACECH-80°-R16 increases by 36.22% compared to R6, while ACECH-90°-R10 shows a 26.64% increase relative to R6. These findings indicate that increasing the circular node diameter significantly improves energy absorption in ACECH-80°, but yields diminishing returns in ACECH-90°. The effects of wall thickness and loading velocity are also investigated, showing that an optimized design can further enhance impact resistance.

This research introduces a novel sandwich structure featuring CFRP face sheets and a multi-level negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb core. Experimental and finite element analysis were conducted to assess the impact resistance of both CFRP laminates and the proposed sandwich structure. A damage model incorporating elastic-plastic behaviour was developed and integrated into the ABAQUS software via VUMAT. Experimental validation confirmed the accuracy of the finite element method (FEM). The study shows that matrix tensile damage is the primary damage mode under low-velocity impacts, with the damage extent and damage pattern being significantly influenced by impactor. Laminate stacking sequences have a minor impact on overall mechanical behaviour but can influence the damage response. Crucially, the honeycomb core configuration significantly enhances energy absorption.

The ERH panel incorporates smoothly varying curvature to reduce stress concentrations and promote uniform deformation under tensile loading. A two-dimensional equivalent model (2D-EKM), developed using the variational asymptotic method, accurately predicts the panel's elastic behavior and is validated against experimental data from uniaxial tensile tests on 3D-printed specimens, as well as high-fidelity finite element simulations. Results show that the ERH design enables a gradual transition from bending- to stretching-dominated deformation, enhancing stiffness while maintaining auxeticity. As a result, the ERH panel achieves a 64% higher elastic modulus, 73% greater tensile energy absorption, and 83% improvement in specific energy absorption compared to arc-shaped counterparts. Parametric analyses further identify optimal geometric configurations—specifically, a major-to-minor axis ratio of 1.9, a cellular aspect ratio of 1.0, and a slenderness ratio of 1.5—as key to maximizing mechanical efficiency.

The configuration was engineered to achieve superior multi-criteria crashworthiness performance compared to Conventional Honeycomb Core (CHC) through tunable morphological design. The energy absorption mechanism of HMCs was theoretically modeled through a discretization method employing Typical Angle Elements (TAEs), with theoretical predictions rigorously validated against Finite Element (FE) simulation results demonstrate predictive accuracy within 5% error tolerance, and the FE model was validated by quasi-static compression tests using a HMC specimen, demonstrating strong agreement between simulation and experiment. Comparative analysis at t = 0.10 mm revealed that HMCs within 30∘≤ θ ≤ 60∘ exhibited superior multi-criteria crashworthiness compared to CHC, demonstrating 7.7% to 16.3% Peak Crush Force (PCF) reduction with concomitant improvements of 6.8% to 8.2% in Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and 13.2% to 15.1% in Crush Force Efficiency (CFE).

A multi-objective optimization framework integrating polynomial surrogate models (quadratic for PCF, cubic for SEA/CFE) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) identified optimal configurations across four optimization scenarios.

In this paper, a circular honeycomb sandwich panel (CHSP) and a beetle elytron sandwich panel (BESP) are designed and manufactured using recyclable cork stoppers. Theoretical investigations are carried out for the insight into their competing failure mechanisms and the failure mode maps are plotted. Quasi-static flatwise compression and three-point bending experiments are performed to address their mechanical properties, which shows good consistency with the analytical estimates. Besides, finite element analysis is conducted to represent failure mechanisms with various geometric configurations.

These features make them ideal for crashworthiness applications. However, their energy absorption strongly depends on the loading orientation, which complicates the definition of a homogenized constitutive law capable of accurately capturing their crushing behavior. Such homogenized laws are essential to reduce computational costs in large-scale simulations. Existing models in literature often rely on constitutive laws with uncoupled degrees of freedom, which may lead to material instability under complex loading conditions. This work presents the development and implementation of a robust homogenized constitutive law for aluminum honeycomb crushing. An initial material database was generated through a campaign of static and dynamic numerical tests, and the resulting mechanical properties were fitted to the honeycomb's geometrical parameters. A code was developed to define the orthotropic elastic tensor based on these properties, including automated stability checks and corrections when necessary. Subsequently, an orthotropic plastic potential was calibrated. After demonstrating the limitations of Hill's potential due to its purely deviatoric nature, a non-associated Deshpande–Fleck plasticity model was adopted and validated through convexity checks and appropriate adjustments. The resulting implementation proved to be robust and reliable. The homogenization procedure was verified and validated against highly localized impact scenarios, showing errors below 10%. Finally, a bottoming law was calibrated using a Monte Carlo approach, further improving accuracy. The novelty of this work lies in the combination of automated stability enforcement, 3D non-associated plasticity based on Hill's and Deshpande-Fleck potentials, fully implementable homogenization framework for honeycomb crushing. Compared to detailed finite element models, the proposed homogenized law achieved an average reduction of approximately 85% in computational time. © 2025","Aluminum Honeycomb; Crushing; Energy absorption; Homogenization; Non-associated Plasticity","Accidents; Aluminum; Biomimetics; Crashworthiness; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Geometry; Homogenization method; Honeycomb structures; Plasticity; Tensors; Aluminium honeycomb; Automotives; Constitutive law; Energy; Energy absorption capability; High specific strength; Homogenization; Non-associated plasticity; Property; Space industry; Crushing; Energy absorption","Thomas, Tiju T., Crushing behavior of honeycomb structure: a review, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 24, 5, pp. 555-579, (2019); Jang, Wen Yea, On the buckling and crushing of expanded honeycomb, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 91, pp. 81-90, (2015); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Wang, Tao, Mechanical response of square honeycomb sandwich plate with asymmetric face sheet subjected to blast loading, Procedia Engineering, 23, pp. 457-463, (2011); Wilbert, A., Buckling and progressive crushing of laterally loaded honeycomb, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 5, pp. 803-816, (2011); Chawla, Anoop, Prediction of crushing behaviour of honeycomb structures, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 8, 3, pp. 229-235, (2003); Ahmed, Naveed, Homogenization of Honeycomb Core in Sandwich Structures: A Review, pp. 159-173, (2019); Soliman, Hazem E., Assessment of existing models for honeycomb homogenized properties, (2015); Wang, Ruoshui, Analysis of in-plane compression and bending of honeycombs with laminated cell walls, 9-2015, (2015); Li, Yuming, Analytical homogenization for in-plane shear, torsion and transverse shear of honeycomb core with skin and thickness effects, Composite Structures, 140, pp. 453-462, (2016)",""

This study proposes an efficient lightweight impact-protection structure with sinusoidal and circular thin-walled beams, inspired by the beaks of woodpeckers integrating with shells of turtles. The finite element simulations on compression and impact reveal that the structure undergoes progressive deformation as the amplitude increases. The analysis results show that both total energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) are significantly influenced by the amplitude, with the maximum SEA reaching 6.75 J/g which is nearly 3 to 4 times higher than the conventional honeycomb structures. Additionally, the results also indicate that increasing the thickness of the structural walls can enhance the compression strength.

However, such approaches inevitably increase the complexity of the unit cell structure. This study innovatively modifies traditional hexagonal honeycombs through an offset configuration. The introduction of this offset design not only avoids increasing the complexity of the unit cell but also enhances crashworthiness by increasing the number of connecting hinges. The performance of the proposed structures was investigated through both experimental testing and numerical simulations. A validated finite element model was then utilized to examine the influence of offset distance and relative density on structural performance. Additionally, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was applied to optimize the structural designs and identify the configuration with the best overall performance. The results demonstrate that, under both identical wall thickness and identical relative density conditions, the crashworthiness of the symmetrically offset hexagonal honeycomb (SOHH) and asymmetrically offset hexagonal honeycomb (AOHH) proposed in this study surpasses that of traditional hexagonal honeycombs. When comparing structures with identical wall thickness, the conventional hexagonal honeycomb (SHH) demonstrates significantly inferior performance to AOHH, with its EA, SEA, MCF, and CFE reaching only approximately 50 %-60 % of AOHH's corresponding values. Furthermore, the offset distance and relative density significantly affect structural performance. When the wall thickness remains constant, the difference between the best and worst performance metrics due to varying offset distances exceeds 50 %. As the relative density increases, the average improvements in EA, SEA, MCF, and PCF for SOHH and AOHH exceed 75 %, while the average increase in CFE surpasses 23 %. The study reveals that SOHH and AOHH exhibit substantial performance enhancements compared to traditional structures. Therefore, the introduction of offset configurations provides a novel design approach for honeycomb structures, offering a promising direction for future research and applications in impact-resistant engineering. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structure; Multi-objective optimization; Offset design; TOPSIS method","Model structures; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Energy; Hexagonal honeycomb; Multi-objectives optimization; Offset design; Relative density; Solution methods; Structural performance; Technique for order preference by similarities to ideal solutions; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method; Honeycomb structures","Wang, Bin, Mushrooming of circular tubes under dynamic axial loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 40, 2, pp. 167-182, (2002); Liu, Yucheng, Bending collapse of thin-walled circular tubes and computational application, Thin-Walled Structures, 46, 4, pp. 442-450, (2008); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Non-linear finite element analysis of bitubal circular tubes for progressive and bending collapses, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 99, pp. 228-236, (2015); Ghoddousi, Saman, Compression response of nature-inspired metamaterials based on Fibonacci spiral, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 285, (2025); Alavi, Ali, Comparative analysis of energy absorption capacity of simple and multi-cell thin-walled tubes with triangular, square, hexagonal and octagonal sections, Thin-Walled Structures, 74, pp. 155-165, (2014); Karagiozova, Dora, Energy absorption of aluminium alloy circular and square tubes under an axial explosive load, Thin-Walled Structures, 43, 6, pp. 956-982, (2005); Bambach, Mike R., Static and dynamic axial crushing of spot-welded thin-walled composite steel-CFRP square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 9, pp. 1083-1094, (2009); Zhang, Xiong, Energy absorption of longitudinally grooved square tubes under axial compression, Thin-Walled Structures, 47, 12, pp. 1469-1477, (2009); Lv, Xiaojiang, On safety design of vehicle for protection of vulnerable road users: A review, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Xu, Shen, Design and study of the crashworthiness of two-way gradient topology star-shaped honeycombs, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, (2025)",""

Based on the method of dimensional analysis, theoretical expression for the plateau force of RHABs is derived. The accuracy of the theoretical expression is validated against numerical simulations with a maximum error of 11.0 % and most errors below 3 %. Finally, the mechanical responses of sandwich arch beams with rectangular honeycomb cores are investigated. Crashworthiness optimization of a sandwich arch beam is conducted via response surface methodology, achieving a 9.80 % improvement in specific energy absorption (SEA) with a high crushing force efficiency (CFE) of 0.94. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Arch beam; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Honeycomb; Impact","Honeycomb structures; Arch beam; Energy; Engineering fields; High-energy absorption; Honeycomb; Honeycomb materials; Impact; Multifunctionality; Sandwich arches; Theoretical expression; Light absorption","Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Chen, Chuanqing, Dynamic behaviors of sandwich panels with 3D-printed gradient auxetic cores subjected to blast load, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 188, (2024); Guo, Kailing, Numerical study on mechanical behavior of foam core sandwich plates under repeated impact loadings, Composite Structures, 224, (2019); Zhang, Wen, Crushing resistance and energy absorption of pomelo peel inspired hierarchical honeycomb, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 125, pp. 163-172, (2019); Fang, Hai, Manufacturing and evaluation of Large-scale Composite Bumper System for bridge pier protection against ship collision, Composite Structures, 158, pp. 187-198, (2016); Wu, Yaozhong, Additively manufactured materials and structures: A state-of-the-art review on their mechanical characteristics and energy absorption, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 246, (2023); Baroutaji, Ahmad, On the crashworthiness performance of thin-walled energy absorbers: Recent advances and future developments, Thin-Walled Structures, 118, pp. 137-163, (2017); Xu, Bin, Crushing behaviours and energy absorption characteristics of square antiprisms structure against flatwise crushing, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 172, (2023); Zhang, Xiong, Energy absorption of arched thin-walled structures under transverse loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 157, (2021); Fu, Xinrong, Three-point bending of thin-walled arched beams with square sections, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023)",""

Penetration tests of aluminum honeycomb sandwich plates were carried out on the ground with wingless, double-winged and three-winged harpoons. The results show that the more wings of the harpoon, the larger the reaming generated during the penetration process, and the stronger the penetration ability. A finite element model for the harpoon penetrating an aluminum honeycomb sandwich plate has been developed, and its accuracy has been validated through experimental comparison. In terms of harpoon adhesion force, the errors of simulation and experimental results are 4.55%, 2.46% and 8.78%, respectively, and the maximum error does not exceed 8.78%. After the harpoon penetrates the aluminum honeycomb sandwich plate, the harpoon attachment effect of the three-wing harpoon is the best, followed by the double-wing harpoon, and finally the wingless harpoon. On this basis, the penetration and adhesion ability of the three-winged harpoon to the rotating and rolling aluminum honeycomb target is simulated by numerical simulation. It is found that when the target has low speed rotation and rolling speed, it has little effect on the adhesion ability of the three-winged harpoon. © The Author(s) 2025","adhesive ability; aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel; impact damage; numerical simulation; Spatial harpoon","Adhesion ability; Adhesive ability; Aluminium honeycomb; Aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Honeycomb sandwich plates; Impact damages; Low velocity impact; Penetration ability; Spatial harpoon","Wei, Ziying, Impact force identification of the variable pressure flexible impact end-effector in space debris active detumbling, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 9, (2020); Mao, Lijun, Study on the penetration characteristics of conical harpoon on rotating space debris, Advances in Space Research, 74, 8, pp. 4109-4122, (2024); Shan, Minghe, Review and comparison of active space debris capturing and removal methods, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 80, pp. 18-32, (2016); Liou, Jer Chyi, An active debris removal parametric study for LEO environment remediation, Advances in Space Research, 47, 11, pp. 1865-1876, (2011); Liou, Jer Chyi, Controlling the growth of future LEO debris populations with active debris removal, Acta Astronautica, 66, 5-6, pp. 648-653, (2010); Mao, Lijun, Study on material J-C parameter fitting and cushioning characteristics of 2A12 aluminum honeycomb sandwich under impact environment, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 27, 4, pp. 813-842, (2025); undefined; Campbell, James C., Development of modelling design tool for harpoon for active space debris removal, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 166, (2022); Forshaw, Jason L., The active space debris removal mission RemoveDebris.

These panels typically consist of three layers: two thin rigid external layers and a thick low-density internal layer with a honeycomb geometric shape. To reduce environmental footprint, eco-friendly materials are encouraged. In this study, we propose an innovative sandwich panel with a core made of Arundo donax rings and skins made of flax fibre-reinforced epoxy composite. Arundo donax is a highly invasive reed in southern Europe. Its rapid growth makes it environmentally advantageous as it can absorb a significant amount of CO<inf>2</inf>which is then sequestered in the panel, enhancing the panel’s sustainability compared to existing alternatives. The honeycomb panels are produced through thermocompression and mechanically tested using pull-off tests and three-point bending. A key novelty of this research is the detailed investigation of the lateral surface roughness of the rings, which has never been studied before. The study explores how different roughness levels affect the adhesion between the core and the skins, the adhesion between the individual Arundo donax rings within the core, as well as the mechanical bending properties of the panel. The results show that polishing treatment significantly impacts all the flexural mechanical properties, especially when performed on lateral surfaces of the rings. In particular, the polishing treatment has increased the flexural strength by 24.25 %, shifting from 19.06 MPa to 25.16 MPa. Numerical simulations are conducted employing Finite Elements with cohesive surface contacts between skins and Arundo donax rings and within the rings. By adjusting the parameters of the cohesive interface, the model can account for different roughness levels and accurately replicate the experimental results. Once calibrated, the model can serve as a design tool. © The Author(s) 2025","Arundo donax; flax fibre; honeycomb panel; sandwich panel; surface roughness","Bending strength; Bending tests; Concretes; Flax; Hydroelasticity; Linen; Mortar; Sandwich structures; Textile fibers; Arundo donax; Bio-based; Composite skins; Epoxy composite; Experimental test; Flax fibres; Honeycomb panels; Lateral surface; Roughness level; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Shi, Shanshan, Load-bearing capacity of composite honeycomb sandwich high-speed train floor, International Journal of Rail Transportation, 13, 1, pp. 171-188, (2025); Ravichandran, Srinath, Experimental and numerical thermal characterization of honeycomb core sandwich structures with glass/polypropylene twill weave composite face sheets, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 231, (2024); Qin, Yinle, Foam-filled aramid honeycomb sandwich composites with high acoustic insulation properties prepared using a unique thermal expansion molding process, Composites Communications, 47, (2024); Son, Min A., Structural origin of negative thermal expansion of cordierite honeycomb ceramics and crystal phase evolution with sintering temperature, Journal of the European Ceramic Society, 39, 7, pp. 2484-2492, (2019); Dutta, Ananta, A novel method of fabricating aluminium honeycomb core by friction stir welding, Thin-Walled Structures, 193, (2023); Habib, Fatah N., Cell geometry effect on in-plane energy absorption of periodic honeycomb structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 5-8, pp. 2369-2380, (2018); Sivakumar, Narain Kumar, Topological approach for optimizing the compressive properties of the square lattice-structured recycled walnut shell Poly Lactic Acid composite, Journal of Building Engineering, 76, (2023); Neje, Ghanshyam, Influence of cell geometrical parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D integrally woven spacer sandwich composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 182, (2020); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

To achieve this, a series of structures with configurable units in both x and y directions were designed, and specimens were fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA) and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials. The research employed a combination of compression tests and finite element simulations to analyze the deformation patterns and failure modes of the specimens.​The main results revealed distinct differences in the structural behavior: three-column structures primarily developed unilateral shear bands, whereas five-column structures exhibited ‘V’-shaped or ‘X’-shaped dual shear bands. Furthermore, variations in compression velocity did not change the overall trend of the force-displacement curves; however, different compression velocities led to different deformation patterns. In terms of materials, structures made of PLA exhibited ‘N’-shaped deformation due to delamination-induced instability within the shear bands, while CFRP structures primarily underwent brittle fracture at the hinge points. The specific energy absorption (SEA) of CFRP is significantly higher than that of PLA. With the increase in the number of layers, the SEA slightly decreases. The increase in the number of columns has a relatively weak impact on SEA.

For this reason, an innovative machining technology based on longitudinal–torsional ultrasonic vibration assistance has been integrated into a CZ10 combined cutting tool, with the aim of optimizing the efficiency of conventional machining processes. To this end, a three-dimensional numerical model based on the finite element method, developed using Abaqus/Explicit 2017 software, was used to simulate the complex interactions between the cutting tool and the thin walls of the structures to be machined. This study aimed to validate the numerical model through experimental tests, quantifying the surface condition, cutting force and tool wear, while evaluating the impact of key machining parameters, such as feed rate and wall thickness, on process performance. The obtained results reveal a substantial reduction in cutting forces, varying from 20 to 40%, as well as a notable improvement in surface finish and a significant extension of tool life.

This review systematically explores bio-inspired cellular structures as promising solutions for improving the impact resistance of EV battery packs. Inspired by natural geometries, these designs exhibit superior energy absorption, controlled deformation behavior, and high structural efficiency compared to conventional configurations. A comprehensive analysis of experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies published up to mid-2025 was conducted, with emphasis on design strategies, optimization techniques, and performance under diverse loading conditions. Findings show that auxetic, honeycomb, and hierarchical multi-cell architectures can markedly enhance specific energy absorption and deformation control, with improvements often exceeding 100% over traditional structures. Finite element analyses highlight their ability to achieve controlled deformation and efficient energy dissipation, while optimization strategies, including machine learning, genetic algorithms, and multi-objective approaches, enable effective trade-offs between energy absorption, weight reduction, and manufacturability. Persistent challenges remain in structural optimization, overreliance on numerical simulations with limited experimental validation, and narrow focus on a few bio-inspired geometries and thermo-electro-mechanical coupling, for which engineering solutions are proposed. The review concludes with future research directions focused on geometric optimization, multi-physics modeling, and industrial integration strategies.

By optimizing the beam angles (θ = 100°-110°), the structure approximates the deformation process and force-displacement response of classical curved-beam NS while achieving 70% higher energy absorption at θ = 100°. Quasi-static cyclic compression tests demonstrated excellent repeatability with 44%-62% energy absorption after four cycles and elastic recovery. Finite element analysis validated the experiments and revealed that the vertical beam thickness dominated the peak force, while the crossbeam stabilized the deformation. These findings suggest that the reusable damping and self-locking effect (θ > 105°) of NS honeycombs could enable rapid force dissipation in building foundations, and the tunable stiffness with controlled vertical beam thickness energy absorption could also enable applications in biomedical implants (e.g. load-adaptive spinal cages) and surgical tools requiring impact-absorbing precision. Therefore, this work establishes PA/CF-based straight-beam NS honeycombs as scalable solutions for tunable and reusable energy-absorbing devices. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This study proposes an anisotropic auxetic configuration—the re-entrant circular star-shaped honeycomb (RECSH)—to enhance energy absorption and reduce initial peak force. A comprehensive investigation involving experimental testing, theoretical modelling, and finite element (FE) simulations was carried out to evaluate the in-plane quasi-static compressive behaviour of RECSH. The results revealed a two-plateau deformation response, each of which exhibited a distinct stress plateau attributed to the structural support provided by the embedded circular geometry. A theoretical framework based on plastic dissipation was developed to predict the plateau stresses, and the influence of key geometric parameters on deformation modes and energy absorption was systematically examined. A multi-objective optimisation strategy was used by a Kriging surrogate model and NSGA-II algorithm to identify an optimal configuration with improved crashworthiness. Compared with conventional designs, the optimised RECSH demonstrates enhanced specific energy absorption (SEA) and reduces initial peak stress (IPS) in both x- and y-directions. This novel auxetic structure offers promising potential for applications in impact mitigation and crash protection systems. © 2025 The Authors","Anisotropic Poisson's ratio; Auxetic honeycomb; Energy absorption; Enhanced performance; Plateau stress; Structural optimisation","Accidents; Anisotropy; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Structural optimization; Anisotropic poisson ratio; Auxetic honeycomb; Auxetics; Energy; Enhanced performance; Limited energies; Performance; Plateau stress; Star-shaped; Structural optimisations; Energy absorption","Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Cheng, Hongchun, Shear Stiffness and Energy Absorption of Auxetic Open Cell Foams as Sandwich Cores, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 256, 1, (2019); Li, Zichuan, Indentation resistance of brittle auxetic structures: Combining discrete representation and continuum model, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 252, (2021); Jiang, Wei, Manufacturing, characteristics and applications of auxetic foams: A state-of-the-art review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 235, (2022); Teng, Xingchi, A simple 3D re-entrant auxetic metamaterial with enhanced energy absorption, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 229, (2022); Etemadi, Ehsan, Enhancing the energy absorption capability of auxetic metamaterials through auxetic cells within re-entrant circular units, Engineering Structures, 315, (2024); Jiang, Feng, Fabrication and crushing response of graded re-entrant circular auxetic honeycomb, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 242, (2023); Li, Zhen, In-plane crushing behaviors of piecewise linear graded honeycombs, Composite Structures, 207, pp. 425-437, (2019); Heo, Hyeonu, Compliant cellular structures: Application to a passive morphing airfoil, Composite Structures, 106, pp. 560-569, (2013); Zhou, Xinran, 3D Printed Auxetic Structure-Assisted Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting and Sensing, Advanced Energy Materials, 13, 34, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Grid and cubic honeycomb structures were designed using TPU83A and TPU95A materials, fabricated via fused deposition modeling (FDM), and subjected to static compression tests to derive stress-strain relationships and buffer coefficients. Finite element simulations in ABAQUS further analyzed static and dynamic mechanical behaviors. Experimental results revealed that the 40 % filled TPU95A grid structure has the largest elastic modulus and the highest compressive strength (1.256 MPa), while the TPU83A grid structure with 20 % infill exhibits the best cushioning performance due to better material flexibility and lower infill density (the minimum buffer coefficient is 2.15 at 44 % strain). Dynamic impact simulations indicated that the TPU83A grid structure with 30 % infill achieved superior resilience and compressive strength under transient loading. These findings highlight the critical role of material hardness, infill density, and structural geometry in balancing compressive resistance and energy absorption.

The effectiveness of this novel design is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments and finite element simulations performed under in-plane and out-of-plane compression. It is demonstrated that the architected hexagonal honeycombs with corrugated stiffeners (AHex) outperform traditional Hex honeycombs of equal weight when subject to in-plane loading along the stiffener direction, reporting maximum enhancements in the elastic modulus, collapse strength and energy absorption of 348 %, 187 % and 112 %. When loaded transverse to the stiffeners or along the out-of-plane direction, the AHex and Hex honeycombs show comparable compressive performance. A finite element-based parametric study further shows that the compressive performance of AHex honeycombs is maximized when the stiffeners are 1.2 times thicker than the hexagonal cell walls and form an internal angle of 155°.

This study illustrates a novel boundary element method (BEM) for analysing the elastodynamic behaviour of cellular structures subjected to low-velocity impact. The proposed method builds on the conventional BEM for solving the transient analysis of anisotropic elastic materials in two dimensions and the contact constraint relations of elastodynamic impact-contact problems. By leveraging these relations, the impact-contact BEM can accommodate various impact-contact situations, e.g. when the indentation depth is prescribed and the initial velocity is given. Previous studies demonstrated that bone-inspired cellular structures (BCS) have superior mechanical performances and higher impact resistance than conventional honeycomb and auxetic structures. This paper further investigates the impact-contact behaviour of BCS materials under impact-contact conditions. The reliability and applicability of the proposed method are validated through comparisons with results obtained using the finite element method (FEM) in a commercial software. With the provided numerical results, the parametric studies of BCS under impact loads are further studied and discussed. These provide valuable insights and help deepen our understanding of the elastodynamic impact-contact responses of BCS under impact-contact situations. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Contacts (fluid mechanics); End effectors; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Transient analysis; Auxetics; Boundary element approaches; Boundary-element methods; Cellular structure; Condition; Contact analysis; Contact event; Elasto-dynamics; Low velocity impact; Protective structures; Software reliability","Metal Foams A Design Guide, (2000); Banhart, John, Manufacture, characterisation and application of cellular metals and metal foams, Progress in Materials Science, 46, 6, pp. 559-632, (2001); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Novak, Nejc, Mechanical behavior of cellular materials-from quasistatic to high strain rate impact response, pp. 109-154, (2021); Li, Shunfeng, Impact analysis of a honeycomb-filled motorcycle helmet based on coupled head-helmet modelling, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 199, (2021); Di Landro, Luca Angelo, Deformation mechanisms and energy absorption of polystyrene foams for protective helmets, Polymer Testing, 21, 2, pp. 217-228, (2002); De Huan Li, Elastodynamic response of an interface crack in a layered composite under anti-plane shear impact load, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 39, 4, pp. 687-693, (1991); Das, Sananda, Elastodynamic response of a cracked orthotropic medium under impact loading, Computational Materials Science, 37, 1-2, pp. 187-192, (2006); Krause, Rolf H., A family of space-time connecting discretization schemes with local impact detection for elastodynamic contact problems, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 200, 47-48, pp. 3425-3438, (2011); Hauret, Patrice, Energy-controlling time integration methods for nonlinear elastodynamics and low-velocity impact, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 195, 37-40, pp. 4890-4916, (2006)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Honeycomb array perforated steel (HAPS) exhibits distinct protective performance against explosively formed projectiles (EFPs) compared to conventional bullets. A smooth particle hydrodynamics finite-element model numerical simulation and an experimental verification method were used to study the ballistic performance. An analysis was performed to assess the impact of the HAPS arrangement and EFP impact points on protective capabilities. The findings reveal that the protective efficacy is most pronounced when HAPS is placed between two layers of target panels. In the embedding damage mode, the maximum deformation of the back panel in the sandwich structure with HAPS decreased by 52.7 % compared with the HAPS front configuration. In the penetration mode, the ballistic limit velocity increased by 9.9 % compared with the HAPS front configuration. Moreover, the impact location and of the EFP and the cell size of HAPS influences the EFP's penetration capability, with the asymmetric contact between the HAPS and the EFP enhancing the resistance of the structure. Petallike perforations were observed at the rear of the HAPS. These discoveries provide insight into the development of protective structures and offer valuable perspectives for structural design and applications in related fields. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Ballistic performance; Explosively formed projectile; Laminated structure; Perforated steel","Energy efficiency; Explosive forming; Explosives; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Projectiles; Structural design; Ballistic performance; Critical challenges; Explosively formed projectiles; High Speed; Honeycomb arrays; Kinetic-energy projectile; Laminated structures; Lightweight protective structures; Perforated steel; Projectile impact; Numerical methods","Guo, Haoyuan, Review of sandwich structures under impact loadings: Experimental, numerical and theoretical analysis, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024); Hua, Luqing, Out-of-plane energy absorption of 3D printed basalt-fiber-reinforced hierarchical honeycomb composite, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 285, (2025); Costa, Edinilson A., Parametric optimization framework for designing sandwich panels with auxetic core subjected to impact load, Composite Structures, 347, (2024); Wang, Xin, Shock resistance of elastomer-strengthened metallic corrugated core sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 237, (2022); Li, Lang, Response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under combined shock and impact loading: Experimental and numerical investigations, Thin-Walled Structures, 193, (2023); Martin, Romain Georges, CF/PEEK skins assembly by induction welding for thermoplastic composite sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 284, (2024); Baloš, Sebastian S., Perforated plate for ballistic protection—a review, Metals, 11, 4, (2021); Shi, Fangfang, Research and application of relay protection setting calculation for SFC system of pumped storage power station, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 2708, 1, (2024); Fra̧ś, Teresa, Fracture of high-strength armor steel under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 111, pp. 147-164, (2018); Sun, Guangyong, On the structural parameters of honeycomb-core sandwich panels against low-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 216, (2021)",""

In reality, however, such sandwich cylindrical shells frequently face the threat of lateral impacts like in the case of high-speed railways and tube/pipeline systems. To explore the dynamic response of a fully-clamped sandwich cylindrical shell under lateral shock loading, a combined experimental and numerical study is carried out. Specimens of aluminum (Al) corrugated core sandwich cylindrical shells as well as thin-walled Al cylindrical shells are fabricated using the method of extrusion. Impact tests on these specimens are conducted using closed-cell Al foam projectiles launched via a light-gas gun. For each specimen, dynamic structural evolution, final deformation mode, and quantitative deflection are comprehensively measured and analyzed. Subsequently, a finite element (FE) model is established to simulate the lateral impact test, with good agreement against experimental measurements achieved. The validated FE model is then employed to quantify the effect of the number of corrugations in the core and explore energy absorption characteristics of individual components in the sandwich shell. In comparison with a thin-walled cylindrical shell of equal mass, the corrugated core sandwich cylindrical shell exhibits elevated lateral shock resistance (particularly so in the case of outer surface mid-point deflection on the impact side and inner diameter crushing), due mainly to energy absorption via core compression. However, within the studied range of impact momentum, the sandwich shell experiences consistently more significant bulging on the rear side than its thin-walled counterpart. A circumferential stress distribution map is constructed to reveal that the introduction of a corrugated core interrupts the continuous transmission path of circumferential stress along the shell's circumferential direction. As a result, the contribution of circumferential membrane force to rear-side deformation is reduced while the influence of bending moment becomes dominant, leading to more significant bulging deformation on the rear side of the sandwich shell. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Circumferential membrane force; Corrugated core; Foam projectile; Lateral shock loading; Sandwich cylindrical shell","Bending (deformation); Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; Light rail transit; Railroad transportation; Structural dynamics; Subways; Circumferential membrane force; Corrugated core; Cylindrical shell; Energy; Foam projectile; Lateral shock loading; Membrane force; Sandwich cylindrical shells; Shock loadings; Thin-walled; Thin walled structures","Alghamdi, Abdulmalik A.A., Collapsible impact energy absorbers: An overview, Thin-Walled Structures, 39, 2, pp. 189-213, (2001); Bardi, F.

As a common type of lattice structure, honeycomb structures exhibit superior mechanical properties and have been widely studied and applied. Based on the traditional panel-based honeycomb structure, two types of truss-honeycomb structures-HS and FHS-were designed in this study by integrating topology optimization and multi-scale reinforcement design strategies. The structures were fabricated using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology. Their performance was analyzed through pendulum impact tests, quasi-static compression tests, and drop-weight impact tests, accompanied by finite element simulations of both quasi-static compression and drop-weight impact processes. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the FHS structure exhibits significantly higher yield strength than the HS structure. Moreover, for different height-to-width ratios, the energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the FHS structures are consistently greater than those of the HS structures. In addition, the FHS structures demonstrate more stable failure modes during impact loading, and their energy absorption performance can be further enhanced by adjusting the height-to-width ratio. Overall, compared with conventional honeycomb structures, the FHS structures not only achieve more pronounced lightweight characteristics but also exhibit superior mechanical properties and stable energy absorption behavior. This design approach offers a novel pathway for enhancing the energy absorption capacity and improving the impact resistance of truss structures. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy absorption; Failure modes; Impact testing; Lattice structures","Compression testing; Compressive strength; Design for testability; Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; Marine navigation; Model structures; Offshore technology; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Subsea engineering; Trusses; Absorption performance; Drop-weight impacts; Energy; Impact behavior; Impact energy; Lattice structures; Mechanical; Property; Quasi-static compression; Width ratio; Impact testing; absorption; additive; computer simulation; experimental study; manufacturing; numerical model; optimization","Angadi, S.

The mechanical behavior of these metamaterials under compressive and bending loads was examined through a combination of experimental tests and finite element simulations. Stress-strain curves, deformation mechanisms, and energy absorption properties were analyzed to compare the benchmark honeycomb structure with the proposed single (SSS) and double (DSS) symmetry-broken models. Results show that both SSS and DSS models outperform the conventional star design in specific energy absorption (SEA) and effective Young's modulus (E<inf>e</inf>) during compression, with DSS exhibiting 68.8 % higher E<inf>e</inf> and SSS achieving 35.6 % higher SEA at 0.5 strain. Under flexural loading, the SSS design surpassed the conventional structure by approximately 26.8 % in SEA at 40 mm deflection. Additionally, the study explores the impact of different assembly mechanisms, including interspaced array and chiral vertex configurations, on compressive performance. It was found that assembly patterns significantly affect the load distribution and energy absorption of the metamaterials. Under out-of-plane compression, DSS and SSS honeycombs showed 19.73 % and 19.16 % higher SEA at 0.3 strain, respectively. Furthermore, the DSS design demonstrated 21.43 % greater SEA under out-of-plane bending compared to the benchmark. The SSS design, particularly when using interspaced array or chiral vertex assemblies, demonstrated superior SEA and structural stability compared to the benchmark and DSS models.

Compared to other processes, continuous fiber 3DP allows for the formation of a single integral piece, resulting in exceptionally high strength and ductility of connection between face and core. The bending performance of the structure was investigated, revealing its excellent bending energy absorption characteristics. Given the complexity of fiber distribution in continuous fiber 3DP, which exceeds that of traditional laminated continuous fiber structures and exhibits non-uniform mechanical characteristics, the conventional finite element modeling method is no longer adequate. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale FE calculation model based on Representative Volume Elements. After experimental validation, this model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the peak load, the deformation stage preceding the peak load, and the failure deformation shape. Utilizing this model, the analysis of path stress distribution and parameter influence is conducted, which elucidates the internal cause of structural failure progression. In the parameter influence analysis, it was found that the thickness of the face plate has the most significant impact on the structural bearing capacity, with the potential to increase the maximum peak load by 65.9% without increasing the fiber content. © The Author(s) 2025","3D printing; bending properties; continuous fiber reinforced composite; corrugated sandwich; failure behavior; multi-scale simulation","Bending (forming); Bending strength; Corrugated materials; Fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Laminated composites; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bending properties; Continuous fiber reinforced composite; Continuous fibers; Corrugated sandwich; Failure behaviors; Fibre-reinforced composite; Multi-scale simulation; Peak load; Sandwich structures","Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Sun, Guangyong, Lightweight hybrid materials and structures for energy absorption: A state-of-the-art review and outlook, Thin-Walled Structures, 172, (2022); Osa-Uwagboe, Norman, Mechanical behaviour of fabric-reinforced plastic sandwich structures: A state-of-the-art review, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 25, 5, pp. 591-622, (2023); Palomba, Giulia, Lightweight sandwich structures for marine applications: a review, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 26, pp. 4839-4864, (2022); Yu, Yang, Dynamic response of the hybrid honeycomb sandwich panel with zero Poisson’s ratio under low-speed impact, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 25, pp. 7024-7038, (2024); Amith Kumar, S.

The finite element model validated by the experiment was established to investigate the impact responses of the hierarchical and graded hierarchical honeycomb sandwich panels under low-velocity impact energies. Theoretical formulas based on the energy-balance model were established to predict the total energy absorption, maximum impact force and residual lower facesheet deflection of both the conventional (Type 1 structure) and hierarchical (Type 2 structure) honeycomb sandwich structures. A polynomial model was used to establish the regression equations for the structural stiffness, upper facesheet indentation depth, and residual lower facesheet deflection of the sandwich structures with double-layer graded hierarchical honeycomb cores (Type 3 structure). The improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm was employed to perform a multi-objective optimization design on the impact responses of Type 3 structures. The results showed that both the hierarchical and graded hierarchical honeycomb cores can improve the stiffness and impact resistance of sandwich structures when the density of sandwich structures was same. However, under an impact energy of 100J, applying the hierarchical honeycomb core to the Type 2 structure increased the deflection of the lower facesheet. Compared to the Type 1 structure, the optimized Type 3 structure exhibited the highest structural stiffness and both the smallest upper facesheet indentation depth and the smallest residual lower facesheet deflection under an impact energy of 100J, with improvements of 39%, 15%, and 33%, respectively. Moreover, the low-velocity impact responses of Type 2 and Type 3 structures were influenced by the structural organization parameter and the gradient rate.

The research methodology involved an initial calibration phase, where simulations of simple test geometries were iteratively refined to match experimental data from dynamic tests within a 1% error margin. These validated material parameters were then applied to a final impact attenuator design featuring a five-tube configuration. To enhance time and cost efficiency, physical testing was conducted only at the intermediate component level, where simulation models were calibrated. The final crash structure was then optimized entirely through virtual simulations, eliminating the need for full-scale physical prototyping. Finite element simulations demonstrated that the proposed structure meets established deceleration and energy dissipation criteria with a significant safety margin. Additionally, compared to a commercially available aluminum honeycomb attenuator, the composite design achieved equivalent energy absorption characteristics while reducing weight by 13%.

The harpoon capture of space debris was investigated through ground experiments and numerical simulations. Ballistic tests were conducted to determine the damage modes and ballistic limit velocities of both contacted and spaced CFRP/aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels. The results indicate that, due to differences in stress wave propagation, reflection, and energy dissipation mechanisms across multi-layer structures, the ballistic limit velocity of the contacted target plate was 4.7 % higher than that of the spaced target plate. Subsequently, a finite element model of the multi-layer structure target plate was developed using a user-defined VUMAT subroutine in ABAQUS to simulate in detail the impact response, damage evolution, and energy absorption processes of the target plate. The results indicate that the impact point location of the harpoon has a limited effect on velocity decay and energy absorption. Additionally, the front and rear sides of the target plate exhibit distinctly different damage characteristics: regular hole expansion on the front side and fiber tearing with delamination on the rear side. Regarding energy absorption, variations in impact velocity have a minimal effect on the total energy absorption. The contacted target plate absorbs significantly more energy than the spaced target plate, with over 85% of the energy absorption occurring during the penetration of the Al2024 aluminum alloy sheet by the harpoon. The proportion of energy absorption in different phases remained stable, with changes in impact velocity having little effect on the energy absorption ratio in each phase. © 2025","CFRP/aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels; Energy absorption; Harpoon; Impact response; Space debris","ABAQUS; Aluminum alloys; Ballistics; Energy dissipation; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Structural panels; Wave propagation; Aluminium honeycomb; Ballistic limit velocity; CFRP/aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel; Energy; Harpoon; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact response; Multilayer structures; Rear side; Target plates; Energy absorption; Space debris","undefined, (2025); Bonnal, Christophe, Active debris removal: Recent progress and current trends, Acta Astronautica, 85, pp. 51-60, (2013); Liou, Jer Chyi, Controlling the growth of future LEO debris populations with active debris removal, Acta Astronautica, 66, 5-6, pp. 648-653, (2010); Guo, Jia, Optimal planning for a multi-debris active removal mission with a partial debris capture strategy, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 36, 6, pp. 256-265, (2023); Svotina, Victoria V., Space debris removal – Review of technologies and techniques.

This study introduced a novel star-shaped re-entrant circular (SRC) honeycomb, which was achieved by embedding a circular structure into a star-shaped structure and shortening the length of vertical ligaments. A quasi-static crushing test investigated the in-plane compression behavior of the SRC honeycomb. The simultaneous plastic buckling of all cell walls caused the SRC honeycomb to exhibit an “I”-shaped deformation mode, and the compression stiffness was significantly enhanced while maintaining the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. A reliable finite element model was established to systematically reveal the deformation mechanism of the SRC honeycomb. Subsequently, theoretical models were established to predict the compression stiffness of the SRC honeycomb, and theoretical equations matched well with numerical simulation results. Under dynamic impact loading, the SRC honeycomb still exhibited an “I”-shaped deformation mode, and SEA was enhanced with an increase in impact velocity while CSE was decreased. The thickness ratio (δ) of different types of cell walls significantly regulated the crushing stress efficiency (CSE), compression stiffness (E) and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the SRC honeycomb. Compared with those of the elliptical annular re-entrant (EARE) honeycomb with the same relative density, the E and SEA of the SRC-δ honeycomb were enhanced by about 513.04% and 47.4 %, respectively.

An integrated approach, combining experiment, simulation, and theoretical methods, was used. Local loading experiments were conducted to validate the accuracy of the finite element model. Furthermore, a control equation was formulated to correlate structural parameters with response modes, and a matching coefficient λ (representing the ratio of core thickness to face sheet thickness) was introduced to establish a link between these parameters and impact characteristics. A demand-driven reverse design methodology for structural parameters was developed, with numerical simulations employed to assess its effectiveness. The results indicate that the proposed theory can accurately predict response modes and key indicators. An increase in the λ bolsters the structural indentation resistance while concurrently heightens the likelihood of penetration. Conversely, a decrease in the λ improves the resistance to penetration, albeit potentially leading to significant deformations in the rear face sheet. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the reverse design methodology significantly enhances the structural penetration resistance. Comparative analyses indicate that appropriate matching reduces indentation depth by 27.4% and indentation radius by 41.8% of the proposed structure.

This study introduces an interesting honeycomb structure known as the hybrid topological cellular honeycomb structure (HTCHS), which integrates four distinctive topological cells. To effectively fabricate HTCHS samples, the research utilized a fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, employing polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG) as the matrix material, successfully producing the HTCHS samples. A finite element simulation model for the HTCHS is created using LS-DYNA software(LS-DYNA R11.1.0 software), and its accuracy is confirmed through a comparative analysis of experimental and simulation results. The influence of the topological cell parameters (T<inf>1</inf> to T<inf>4</inf>) on compressive energy absorption, specific energy absorption, and peak crushing force through parametric modeling is investigated. The mechanical properties of honeycomb structures vary depending on the cell parameters at different positions, and monotonically increasing the design parameters does not improve the energy absorption capacity of the HTCHS. To enhance the mechanical performance of the HTCHS, the initial periodic cell configurations are transformed into non-periodic designs. A discrete optimization design framework for local parameters of the HTCHS is established, integrating cell coding with the MOPSO algorithm. The feasibility of the optimization results is validated through experimental data, demonstrating that this study offers an effective technical solution for developing a novel generation of cellular honeycomb structures with customizable mechanical properties. © 2025 by the authors.","3D printing; bionics design; energy absorption; honeycomb structures; mechanical property","Bearings (machine parts); Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Bionics; Cells; Computer aided design; Computer software; Cytology; Loads (forces); Structural design; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bio-inspired designs; Bionic design; Cell parameterS; Cellulars; Energy; Mechanical; Property; Structure samples; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Xu, Xiang, Adjustable Ultra-Light Mechanical Negative Poisson's Ratio Metamaterials with Multi-Level Dynamic Crushing Effects, Small, 20, 43, (2024); Hirankittiwong, Pemika, Advanced engineered nanostructures for aerospace technology: A review, Results in Engineering, 26, (2025); Zinno, Alberto, Experimental characterization of phenolic-impregnated honeycomb sandwich structures for transportation vehicles, Composite Structures, 93, 11, pp. 2910-2924, (2011); Alabtah, Fatima Ghassan, Energy absorption characteristics of a bio-inspired prepreg carbon fiber crash box under quasi-static axial compression, Composites Part C: Open Access, 14, (2024); Wang, Danqi, Safety assessment of intelligent vehicles considering drivers’ risk perception information under interval 2-tuple q-rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets, Applied Soft Computing, 175, (2025); Haq, Ahsan Ul, Experimental and numerical investigation on the ballistic impact performance of sandwich panels with additively manufactured honeycomb cores, Aerospace Science and Technology, 155, (2024); Ul Haq, Ahsan, Dynamic response of honeycomb cored sandwich panels under high velocity impact: A numerical study, Materials Today: Proceedings, (2023); Silva, Rita De Cássia, Effect of 3D-Printed Honeycomb Core on Compressive Property of Hybrid Energy Absorbers: Experimental Testing and Optimization Analysis, Materials, 17, 2, (2024); Song, Jian, Energy-Absorption Behavior of Novel Bio-Inspired Thin-Walled Honeycomb Tubes Filled with TPMS Structure, Coatings, 14, 6, (2024); Ju, Jinlong, Experiment and Simulation Study on the Crashworthiness of Markforged 3D-Printed Carbon/Kevlar Hybrid Continuous Fiber Composite Honeycomb Structures, Materials, 18, 1, (2025)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

When a projectile obliquely impacts the shield at hypervelocity, the radial multilayer foils can effectively break the projectile through multiple impacts, thereby reducing the impact momentum of the debris on the rear panel and absorbing the main impact energy. In this study, we employed the finite element-smooth particle hydrodynamics adaptive method to replicate experiments on the oblique hypervelocity impacts of spherical projectiles on homogeneous aluminum plates and honeycomb sandwich shields. Based on both the experimental and simulation results, we described the evolution of the debris cloud. In addition, we analyzed the distribution characteristics of the debris cloud and modeled the structural characteristics corresponding to the oblique impacts of spherical projectiles on different protective structures. We also analyzed how the honeycomb core influences the debris cloud during oblique impact to define the failure modes of the front and rear panels as well as the honeycomb core materials. Furthermore, we define the different stages in which damage occurs and examine the response processes for the honeycomb sandwich shields.

Based on the deconstruction of honeycomb structures, a modular hierarchical honeycomb protection system (MHHS) is developed in this study, offering easy assembly and transportation. The protective performance and deformation behaviors of the modular system are evaluated through drop weight impact tests at 20 J and 60 J, verifying the validity of the finite element simulations. Compared to the integrated honeycomb structure, the modular system reduces peak force by 50% on average while enhancing dynamic specific energy absorption by 54.7% (20 J) and 217% (60 J). The collision durations of the modular system are approximately 2.8 times and 5.5 times longer, indicating less structural stiffness and more structural elasticity. The self-locking effect of the modular system emerges from interactions between the bolts’ bidirectional three-point bending deformation and transverse compressive deformation of components, promoting tighter deformation coupling. Two structural failure criteria are established based on the multi-peak and multi-wave characteristics of response curves, enabling effective dataset preprocessing. The XGBoost model is trained to predict binary classification outcomes for bi-objective analysis based on the modular system performance failure scenarios. The trained model effectively addresses the impact inverse problem, reducing testing costs by 86.1% while maintaining 80% accuracy against simulation benchmarks.

This paper presents a new approach for evaluating how uncertainties affect the low-velocity impact performance of hybrid structures that integrate features from sandwich structures, laminated composites, and FG materials. These hybrid systems, known as Hybrid FG-Sandwich Structures (HFGSS), combine the benefits of each individual component into a single, adaptable structure.

For the first time, a systematic parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of unit cell (UC) geometry, including connection angle, link length, and thickness, on the natural frequency of both beam types by considering more than 22,000 different UC geometries. In this regard, a novel and adjustable UC design is employed to directly compare the auxetic and honeycomb configurations. The study also explores the influence of UC row numbers and orientations on the natural frequency of these beams. The results declare that variations in each of them lead to nonlinear increases or decreases in natural frequencies. As well, for most cases under identical conditions, the natural frequencies for honeycomb beams are found to be higher than those for auxetic beams. These findings address a significant gap in the literature and provide valuable insights for the design of lightweight, vibration-resistant structures in applications such as aerospace, automotive, and smart systems. Furthermore, this work contributes to the advancement of parametric design in auxetic and honeycomb beams, offering a framework to support dynamic and vibration performance improvements in engineering applications. © 2025 University of Tehran.

A finite element (FE) numerical model is established to investigate the in-plane mechanical properties of the MDMH under quasi-static and dynamic compression. The static contact deformation modes in different compression phases are compared to reveal the stress transformation mechanism, and the stress fluctuations under dynamic impact are explained from the perspective of the stepwise contact and inertial effect. Based on the local instability analysis, three improved MDMHs with different reinforced ribs are developed to enhance the configuration stability. The in-plane mechanical properties of improved MDMHs are explored to verify the effectiveness of the design for stability enhancement. Moreover, the effects of wall thickness and configuration angle on the stress-strain characteristics are systematically discussed. The results indicate that the static stiffness of the MDMH is significantly enhanced when the deformation mode transformation triggered by the designed internal contact is produced. The stress characteristics of the MDMH are sensitive to the impact velocity due to the inertia effect. The configuration stability enhancement design with attached reinforced ribs effectively improves the ultimate support performance and energy absorption capacity.

First, experimental tests were conducted to compare the in-plane impact performance of square-diamond honeycomb (SDH) and square-tetra-chiral honeycomb (STH), validating the accuracy of the finite element model. Subsequently, the deformation modes and energy absorption characteristics of the four honeycomb structures were analyzed under identical wall thickness and impact velocity conditions. The results indicate that at an impact velocity of 10 m/s, square-concave hexagonal honeycomb (SCHH-I) exhibits higher specific energy absorption (SEA) compared to the other three hybrid honeycombs. Under high-velocity impact, the SEA of the composite honeycomb increases with the rise in impact velocity, with SCHH-2 exhibiting the most significant increase in SEA, reaching its maximum value at an impact velocity of 100 m/s. For the STH structure, which demonstrated lower energy absorption, novel honeycomb designs with varying symmetrical configurations were proposed. The research results indicate that under low-velocity impacts, the energy absorption capacity is best for the left–right symmetric design of STH-III and the centrally symmetric design of STH-VI. However, this improvement does not confer an advantage under high-speed impacts. Overall, the symmetric arrangement strategy can enhance the impact resistance of the honeycomb structure. © Wroclaw University of Science and Technology 2025.","Energy absorption; Hybrid honeycombs; Negative Poisson’s ratio; Plateau stress","Geometry; Poisson ratio; Specific energy; Structural design; Absorption characteristics; Axial crushing; Energy; Hybrid honeycomb; Impact velocities; Negative poisson’s ratio; Plateau stress; S ratio; Specific energy absorption; Symmetric design; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Wei, Lulu, In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb: Experimental and numerical simulation, Aerospace Science and Technology, 115, (2021); Qu, Yunfei, Analyses on the roller structure of equivalent honeycombs for forest harvester under impact loading, Composite Structures, 262, (2021); Ren, Xin, Auxetic nail: Design and experimental study, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 288-298, (2018); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Xu, Hanghang, Mechanical properties of aluminum foam filled re-entrant honeycomb with uniform and gradient designs, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 244, (2023); Jin, Yutong, A new calculation method of in-plane elastic properties analytical model for novel nested honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced Young's modulus, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 97, (2023); Zhang, Chenglin, Energy absorption characteristics of novel bio-inspired hierarchical anti-tetrachiral structures, Composite Structures, 313, (2023); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic polymers: a new range of materials, Endeavour, 15, 4, pp. 170-174, (1991); Ma, Nanfang, Hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb metamaterial for energy absorption and vibration insulation, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 250, (2023); Jiang, Feng, Quasi-static crushing behavior of novel circular double arrowed auxetic honeycombs: Experimental test and numerical simulation, Thin-Walled Structures, 177, (2022)",""

Restricted by the temperature range of the strain gauge, ballistic impact tests were carried out at 25 °C, 100 °C, and 200 °C. Secondly, a finite element (FE) model including a pointed bullet and an aluminum honeycomb sandwich plate was built using LS-DYNA. The corresponding simulations of the strain–time curve and damage conditions showed good agreement with the test results. Then, the containment capability of the aluminum honeycomb sandwich aero-engine casing at different temperatures was analyzed based on the kinetic energy loss of the blade, the internal energy increment of the casing, and the containment state of the blade.

To prevent potential damage, various strategies have been attempted to date with limited success. Among possible strategies, the current study investigated the unique capabilities of energy-absorbing aluminum composites in providing a protective panel to resist impact-induced forces. To achieve a holistic assessment, three core alternatives, i.e., aluminum honeycomb, aluminum foam, and expanded polystyrene foam, sandwiched between aluminum plates, were considered in this study. The selected composite panels had been used as impact-resistant components in mechanical and aerospace engineering applications, but their applications in the civil engineering domain had remained marginal, mainly because of limited studies performed on them. To address the fundamental questions related to the response of this category of composites to over-height collisions, the current study utilized a set of high-fidelity finite-element models. The developed models were validated with a suite of experimental test results from past studies. The models replicated two representative concrete girders, each without and with energy-absorbing composite panels. The added panels were in various configurations, in terms of geometric and material properties. Upon simulating the over-height collision with a range of impact intensities and velocities, key response measures were evaluated, including energy absorption, impact force, and girder damage. This holistic investigation's outcome led to a set of recommendations on the energy-absorbing composites of choice configured to minimize the damage from over-height collisions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Design optimization; Energy-absorbing composites; Impact analysis; Over-height collision; Structural response","Honeycomb structures; Pressure vessels; 'current; Aluminum composites; Composite panels; Concrete superstructures; Design optimization; Energy; Energy-absorbing composite; Impact analysis; Over-height collision; Structural response; Concrete beams and girders; aluminum; civil engineering; collision; composite; concrete structure; energy flow; holistic approach; impact; structural analysis; structural component; structural response","undefined, (2013); Elshazli, Mohamed T., Comprehensive Numerical Modeling of Prestressed Girder Bridges under Low-Velocity Impact, Buildings, 14, 3, (2024); Nguyen, Bella, Understanding the Problem of Bridge and Tunnel Strikes Caused by Over-height Vehicles, Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 3915-3924, (2016); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2008); Yang, Mijia, Analysis of cushion systems for impact protection design of bridges against overheight vehicle collision, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 12, pp. 1220-1228, (2010); Cheng, Shi, Numerical analysis of I-Lam honeycomb sandwich panels for collision protection of reinforced concrete beams, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 19, 4, pp. 497-522, (2017); Li, Xiangcheng, Experimental study on out-of-plane mechanical and energy absorption properties of combined hexagonal aluminum honeycombs under dynamic impact, Materials and Design, 194, (2020); Pietras, Daniel, Out-of-plane crushing response of aluminum honeycombs in-situ filled with graphene-reinforced polyurethane foam, Composite Structures, 249, (2020); Han, Qigang, Study on mechanical properties of multi-structure dactyl-inspired sandwich honeycomb with basalt fiber, Composite Structures, 247, (2020)",""

Due to the complexity of the foldcore and the strong anisotropy of the fiber material, the fiber laying angle significantly influences the foldcore's performance. This study investigates the effect of the fiber lay-up angle on the S-shaped foldcore's anisotropy by fabricating foldcore sandwich composite panels using hot compression molding. Panels were laid along the in-face folding direction, the out-face folding direction, and cross-laid in both directions. A low-speed impact method was used to observe and analyze the damage to the foldcore structure. The impact process was also simulated using the finite element method combined with the Hashin's criterion as a means of identification of material failure initiation to analyze the damage and fracture process. Results showed that the composite foldcore sandwich panel laid along the in-face folding direction exhibited the strongest impact resistance. Panels laid in the in-face folding direction were more prone to fracture due to higher damage levels, while those with fibers in the out-face folding direction were more susceptible to fiber tensile damage, causing more fracture in rear panel. © 2025 The Author(s)","Damage; Foldcore; FRP; Hashin's criterion; Impact loads","Compression molding; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Angle effects; Damage; Damage behaviour; Foldcore; Foldings; Fracture behavior; FRP; Hashin's criterion; Impact loads; S-shaped; Anisotropy","Huo, Xintao, On low-velocity impact response of foam-core sandwich panels, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 181, (2020); Zhu, Yefei, Low-velocity impact response of multilayer foam core sandwich panels with composite face sheets, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 209, (2021); Lv, Hangyu, Low-velocity impact response of composite sandwich structure with grid–honeycomb hybrid core, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 246, (2023); Katariya, P.

Through quasi-static compression experiments and finite element analysis, the energy absorption characteristics of BHSCHs of different orders were investigated under both in-plane and out-of-plane loading. The results indicated that the in-plane energy absorption properties of BHSCH relied on the buckling and collapse between cells, with higher-order BHSCHs demonstrating better energy absorption capabilities. In out-of-plane compression, the interaction between internal units of the BHSCH structure increased with higher order, leading to significantly enhanced energy absorption and maximum crushing force. Then, a theoretical compression model was used to calculate the average crushing stress of BHSCHs of each order and analyze their energy dissipation process. Good agreements were found between the predicted and numerical results with the error of less than 10 %, proving the reliability of the proposed model. By comparing the SEA with other honeycomb structures, the BHSCH exhibited excellent mechanical and energy absorption properties. Finally, the local impact resistance of BHSCHs was investigated, exploring the energy absorption capabilities of sandwich structures with different BHSCHs under the impact of small spheres at the same velocity. © Elsevier Masson SAS","Bio-inspired structure; Compression properties; Energy absorbing performance; Hierarchical structure; Honeycomb","Buckling behavior; Buckling loads; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures; Local buckling; Bio-inspired structure; Circular tubes; Compression properties; Energy; Energy absorbing performance; Energy absorption properties; Hierarchical structures; High-order; Honeycomb; Performance; Sandwich structures","Abramowicz, Wlodzimierz, Dynamic axial crushing of square tubes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 2, 2, pp. 179-208, (1984); Ahsanfar, Mojtaba, Optimum Design for Graded Honeycomb as Energy Absorber Device in Elevator Cabin, Procedia Engineering, 173, pp. 1291-1298, (2017); Bader, Thomas Karl, Microstructure-stiffness relationships of common yew and Norway spruce, Strain, 48, 4, pp. 306-316, (2012); Baykasoglu, C., Energy absorption of circular aluminium tubes with functionally graded thickness under axial impact loading, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 20, 1, pp. 95-106, (2015); Captur, Gabriella, Fractal frontiers in cardiovascular magnetic resonance: Towards clinical implementation, Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, 17, 1, (2015); Chen, Weigang, Relative merits of single-cell, multi-cell and foam-filled thin-walled structures in energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 39, 4, pp. 287-306, (2001); Clarke, Daniel John, A systematic numerical and experimental study into the mechanical properties of five honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 264, (2023); Darnal, Aryabhat, Flexibility, toughness, and load bearing of 3D-printed chiral kerf composite structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 284, (2024); Fan, Hualin, Approaching perfect energy absorption through structural hierarchy, International Journal of Engineering Science, 130, pp. 12-32, (2018); Ha, Ngoc-san, Energy absorption characteristics of bio-inspired hierarchical multi-cell bi-tubular tubes, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 251, (2023)",""

While previous studies have shown that hierarchy can increase the buckling strength of lattice materials, a detailed analysis of its impact on fracture toughness is missing. Here, we used analytical modeling and finite element simulations to predict the mode I and mode II fracture toughness of three hierarchical topologies: hexagonal, triangular, and Kagome lattices. Hierarchy significantly improved the fracture toughness of the bending-dominated hexagonal lattice. Notably, the hierarchical hexagonal lattice has a fracture toughness K<inf>IC</inf> that scales linearly with relative density ρ̄, whereas its non-hierarchical counterpart has K<inf>IC</inf>∝ρ̄2. In contrast, hierarchy did not improve the toughness of stretching-dominated triangular and Kagome lattices. Hierarchy did, however, modify the behavior of a Kagome lattice: its hierarchical design has a toughness that scales linearly with relative density, whereas K<inf>IC</inf>∝ρ̄ for its non-hierarchical counterpart. This work presents scaling laws for the fracture toughness of hierarchical lattices, enabling the design of tough architectures at very low densities. © 2025 The Authors","Finite Element simulation; Fracture toughness; Hierarchy; Honeycomb; Lattice material","Crystal lattices; Fracture toughness; Honeycomb structures; Finite elements simulation; Hexagonal lattice; Hierarchical lattice; Hierarchy; Honeycomb; K IC; Kagome lattice; Lattice materials; Relative density; Triangular-lattice; Bulk Density","Ajdari, Amin, Hierarchical honeycombs with tailorable properties, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 49, 11-12, pp. 1413-1419, (2012); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Berger, Jonathan B., Mechanical metamaterials at the theoretical limit of isotropic elastic stiffness, Nature, 543, 7646, pp. 533-537, (2017); Berkache, Kamel, Micropolar effects on the effective elastic properties and elastic fracture toughness of planar lattices, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 93, (2022); Côté, François, The through-thickness compressive strength of a composite sandwich panel with a hierarchical square honeycomb sandwich core, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 76, 6, pp. 1-8, (2009); Fleck, Norman A., Micro-architectured materials: Past, present and future, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 466, 2121, pp. 2495-2516, (2010); Fleck, Norman A., The damage tolerance of elastic-brittle, two-dimensional isotropic lattices, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 3, pp. 562-588, (2007); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Gu, Huaiyuan, Experimental study of modulus, strength and toughness of 2D triangular lattices, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 152-153, pp. 207-216, (2018); Haghpanah, Babak, Self-similar hierarchical honeycombs, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 469, 2156, (2013)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The force-time history, displacement-time history, failure modes, and strain development were analysed to reveal the effects of the protective layer, impact energy, and reinforcement ratio on the dynamic behaviour of composite slabs. Test results revealed that the sandwich panel significantly mitigated shear failure in the reinforced concrete slab. Compared to the reinforced concrete slab, composite slabs developed reduced peak forces and deformations under impact of the same energy. A higher impact energy resulted in increased deformations and damage to the slabs, with the failure mode transforming from bending failure to a combination of bending and punching shear failures. Composite slabs with larger reinforcement ratios could develop greater impact resistances. Furthermore, finite element models were developed for composite slabs under impact. Numerical results show that the sandwich panel develops a cushioning effect and absorbs a large portion of the impact energy initially. Parametric studies reveal that compared to increasing the reinforcement diameter, increasing the reinforcement ratio by reducing the reinforcement spacing is more effective in improving the impact resistance of composite slabs. Besides, although higher-strength concrete can improve the impact resistance of composite slabs, it also increases the risk of punching failure as the concrete is more brittle.

However, the energy absorption performance of these STF related materials is not fully exploited due to the low coupling efficiency between the STF and the structure. In this paper, the dynamic compressive behavior of STF filled star-shaped honeycombs (SSH) with significant negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect was studied using modified SHPB experiments and finite element (FE) simulations. The coupling mechanism between the NPR effect and the shear-thickening behavior of STF is analyzed. The dynamic mechanical performance of the STF-filled SSH (SSH-STF) under initial velocity impact and constant velocity compression loading, including stress distribution, energy dissipation, and coupling strength, is comprehensively analyzed. The results indicate that SSH-STF enhances energy absorption efficiency by the mutual extrusion effect of SSH and STF, which limits local deformation and modifies the unstable deformation mode of SSH, while also expanding the energy absorption region. The shear thickening effect of STF limits 82 % of the in-plane rotation behavior of SSH-STF unit cells compared to unfilled SSH under high-velocity impact, promoting uniform and sufficient contraction deformation across the unit cells, which enhances the mean crushing force by 253 %. Meanwhile, the shear thickening behavior of STF leads to faster stress transfer within SSH, significant enhancement of the local deformation stability and effectively increasing the critical impact velocity of the SSH-STF. In this paper, the significant enhancement of energy absorption performance of the STF-SSH composite provides valuable insights for the design of STF-filled auxetic honeycomb structures in practical applications. © 2025","Critical impact velocities; Dynamic energy absorption behavior; Negative Poisson's ratio; Shear thickening fluid; Star-shaped honeycombs","Compressive strength; Shear flow; Stress concentration; Absorption behaviors; Critical impact velocity; Dynamic energy absorption; Dynamic energy absorption behavior; Energy; Fluid-filled; Negative Poisson ratio; Shear-thickening fluids; Star-shaped; Star-shaped honeycomb; Honeycomb structures","Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Li, Xiang, Auxetic mechanical metamaterials: from soft to stiff, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, 5, 4, (2023); Hu, Qifang, Compressive and tensile behaviours of 3D hybrid auxetic-honeycomb lattice structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 263, (2024); Zhou, Jiahui, Strain-independent auxetic metamaterials inspired from atomic lattice, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 281, (2024); Montazeri, Amin, A Poisson's ratio sign-switching mechanical metamaterial with tunable stiffness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 260, (2023); Pan, Junwei, A novel misplaced reinforced honeycomb with in-plane bidirectional enhancement, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 270, (2024); An, Mingran, In-plane crushing response of a novel bidirectional re-entrant honeycomb with two plateau stress regions, Thin-Walled Structures, 170, (2022); Bohara, Rajendra Prasad, Novel lightweight high-energy absorbing auxetic structures guided by topology optimisation, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 211, (2021); Zhang, Chuanbiao, A novel windmill-shaped auxetic structure with energy absorption enhancement, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 280, (2024); Pan, Yucheng, An integrative warning-protection shear thickened composite sponge towards sensing performance and impact resistance with excellent flame retardant, Composites Part B: Engineering, 279, (2024)",""

Earlier studies have yet to integrate several scenarios in an experiment. This research aims to determine damage to a ship's hull that is assumed to have been stranded due to being hit by a rock under the sea. Design/methodology/approach: This scenario was analyzed by conducting a penetration test simulation using the ANSYS LS DYNA. Modeling was carried out with core, speed, indenter shape and indenter angle variations. The test is carried out by moving the indenter against the plate until the plate is damaged. Findings: The results of this research show that the round indenter gave the best results in testing, while changes in speed below 1.5 m/s did not significantly affect the results.

However, the complex characteristics of this material require specialized machining techniques to avoid defects, ensure optimal surface quality, and preserve the integrity of the cutting tool. Thus, hybrid ultrasonic-vibration-assisted machining (HUSVAM) technology, using a CZ10 combined cutting tool, was introduced to overcome these limitations. To this end, a 3D numerical model based on the finite element method, developed using Abaqus/Explicit 2017 software, allows us to simulate the interaction between the cutting tool and the thin walls of the structure to be machined. The objective of this study was to validate a numerical model through experimental tests while quantifying the impact of critical machining parameters, including the rotation speed and tilt angle, on process performance, in terms of surface finish, tool wear, cutting force components and chip size. The numerical results demonstrated that HUSVAM technology allows for a significant reduction in the cutting force components, with a decrease of between 12% and 35%. Furthermore, this technology improves cutting quality by limiting the deformation and tearing of cell walls, while extending tool life through a significant reduction in wear. These improvements thus contribute to a substantial optimization of the overall efficiency of the machining process. © 2025 by the authors.","chip size; conventional milling; CZ10 tool; finite element method; HUSVAM hybrid machining; Nomex honeycomb structure; surface quality; tool wear","","Li, Liang, A hybrid time integration scheme for the discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of convection-dominated problems, Energies, 13, 8, (2020); Zaharia, Sebastian Marian, Mechanical properties and fatigue performances on sandwich structures with CFRP skin and nomex honeycomb core, Materiale Plastice, 54, 1, pp. 67-72, (2017); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Li, Lu, Effects of ambient humidity and thermal aging on properties of Nomex insulation in mining dry-type transformer, High Voltage, 6, 1, pp. 71-81, (2021); Wei, Xingyu, New advances in fiber-reinforced composite honeycomb materials, Science China Technological Sciences, 63, 8, pp. 1348-1370, (2020); Ranga, Chilaka, Influence of electrical and thermal ageing on the mineral insulating oil performance for power transformer applications, Insight: Non-Destructive Testing and Condition Monitoring, 62, 4, pp. 222-231, (2020); Klocke, Fritz, Abrasive machining of advanced aerospace alloys and composites, CIRP Annals, 64, 2, pp. 581-604, (2015); Zhou, Hui, Mechanical performance and energy absorption properties of structures combining two Nomex honeycombs, Composite Structures, 185, pp. 524-536, (2018); Roy, Rene J., Characterization of Nomex honeycomb core constituent material mechanical properties, Composite Structures, 117, 1, pp. 255-266, (2014); Liu, Longquan, Experimental and numerical study on the mechanical response of Nomex honeycomb core under transverse loading, Composite Structures, 121, pp. 304-314, (2015)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

A tibial implant is necessary to provide mechanical support in open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The pore structure and porosity of implants exert significant effect on tibia stress distribution and lower limb alignment stability. In this study, finite element (FE) analysis and in vitro biomechanical experiments were utilized to evaluate the impact of different tibial implants on postoperative tibial stress distribution. The biomechanical experimental results of experiments on tibial implants exhibit similar mechanical response patterns to the established finite element model, whose maximum displacement error is 1.18% under 1500 N compressive load. The hybrid porous implant developed in this study demonstrated significant stress reductions in both tibial bone (19.97% and 15.33% lower than mono-porous configurations at 73% porosity) and implant body (31.60% and 11.83% reductions, respectively), while exhibiting diminished micromotion tendencies. This consistent performance pattern was maintained across the entire porosity spectrum (53–83%) in implanted specimens. In summary, the finite element model established using authentic tibial CT data can effectively guide the structural design of tibial implants, and optimized pore structure design can provide enhanced mechanical support effects for tibial implants. © 2025 by the authors.","3D printing; finite element analysis; honeycomb structure; implant; open-wedge high tibial osteotomy","Biomechanics; Bone; Dental prostheses; Honeycomb structures; Implants (surgical); Pore structure; Porosity; Structural design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Finite element analyse; High tibial osteotomies; Implant; In-vitro; Mechanical support; Open-wedge high tibial osteotomy; Pores structure; Stresses distribution; Stress concentration","Cui, Aiyong, Global, regional prevalence, incidence and risk factors of knee osteoarthritis in population-based studies, eClinicalMedicine, 29-30, (2020); Schram, Ben L., Risk factors for development of lower limb osteoarthritis in physically demanding occupations: A narrative umbrella review, Journal of Occupational Health, 62, 1, (2020); Briggs, Andrew M., Musculoskeletal Health Conditions Represent a Global Threat to Healthy Aging: A Report for the 2015 World Health Organization World Report on Ageing and Health, Gerontologist, 56, pp. S243-S255, (2016); Steinmetz, Jaimie D., Global, regional, and national burden of osteoarthritis, 1990-2020 and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, The Lancet Rheumatology, 5, 9, pp. e508-e522, (2023); Ryu, Dongjin, Editorial Commentary: Posterolateral Malposition of the Cortical Hinge During Medial Open-Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy Increases Posterior Tibial Slope: Incomplete Posterior Osteotomy May Shift the Hinge From Lateral to Posterolateral, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 37, 7, pp. 2202-2203, (2021); Deng, Xiangtian, Changes in patellar height and posterior tibial slope angle following uniplanar medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy using a novel wedge-shaped spacer implanation concurrent with proximal partial fibulectomy, International Orthopaedics, 45, 1, pp. 109-115, (2021); Greimel, Felix, Medial Open Wedge High tibial Osteotomy (MOWHTO) does not relevantly alter patellar kinematics: a cadaveric study, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 142, 1, pp. 13-21, (2022); Subasi, Omer, Investigation of lattice infill parameters for additively manufactured bone fracture plates to reduce stress shielding, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 161, (2023); Xu, Shipeng, The optimal design of 3D-printed lattice bone plate by considering fracture healing mechanism, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering, 39, 3, (2023); Varaschin, Andrea, Personalised High Tibial Osteotomy Surgery Is Accurate: An Assessment Using 3D Distance Mapping, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 19, (2024)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Their tailored structures/properties under in-plane loading make them ideal for impact resistance and energy absorption (EA) applications in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical engineering. Despite the research advances in this field, research into out-of-plane of graded lattice structures is relatively limited. This study investigates the out-of-plane EA performance of three common lattice structures, namely, hexagonal honeycomb (HEX), auxetic re-entrant (REE), and double arrowhead (DAH). Unique grade patterns including bottom thick (BOT), mid thick (MID), and ends thick (EDG), were introduced in the lattices’ out-of-plane direction and their mechanical behavior was examined under quasi-static compression conditions using both experimental and finite element analysis. Parametric investigations were conducted to examine the effects of grade ratio, cell wall thickness, and grade patterns, aiming to optimize mechanical EA and crashworthiness of each structure. Results show that the specific energy absorption (SEA) of all structures follows the trend MID > EDGE > BOT > UNI and HEX_MID demonstrated the highest SEA value amongst all designs. On the other hand, all graded lattice structures demonstrated significantly enhanced crash force efficiency, with HEX_BOT, REE_EDGE, and DAH_EDGE approaching ∼90% of the maximum performance, showcasing their potential for efficient EA. © 2025 The Author(s).

The energy absorption capabilities of these structures can be further enhanced through design modifications. This study explores novel double-cylindrical-shell-based RE unit cell (REC) designs with negative Poisson’s ratios (NPRs), and the impact of material variations on NPR is analyzed in detail. The REC structures have two distinct geometric configurations: narrow REC (REC-N) and wide REC (REC-W). To demonstrate that these new geometries exhibit NPR behavior, samples were produced using additive manufacturing (AM) with materials including polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and functionally graded (FG) PLA-ABS composites. Compression tests were conducted on the samples, following ASTM-D695-15 standards, to determine the Poisson’s ratios. The experimental results obtained were validated against numerical results for all material combinations. It is demonstrated that the NPR can vary by up to 20% with changes in the REC cell geometry design for the same material combination. It is stated that changes in the material composition can alter the NPR by up to 11%. Therefore, it is shown that both the REC cell design and material variations lead to significant changes in the NPR. © 2025 by the authors.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; auxetic; finite element analysis; functionally graded; metamaterial; negative Poisson’s ratio; uniaxial compression","Convergence of numerical methods; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Auxetics; Cell design; Finite element analyse; Functionally graded; Negative poisson’s ratio; S ratio; Uni-axial compression; Unit cells; Metamaterials","International Advanced Researches and Engineering Journal, (2018); Williams, John Leicester, Properties and an anisotropic model of cancellous bone from the proximal tibial epiphysis, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 104, 1, pp. 50-56, (1982); Lees, Caroline M., Poisson’s ratio in skin, Bio-Medical Materials and Engineering, 1, 1, pp. 19-23, (1991); Frolich, Larry M., Poisson's ratio of a crossed fibre sheath: the skin of aquatic salamanders, Journal of Zoology, 232, 2, pp. 231-252, (1994); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Mousanezhad, Davood, Elastic properties of chiral, anti-chiral, and hierarchical honeycombs: A simple energy-based approach, Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters, 6, 2, pp. 81-96, (2016); Hou, Yangqing, Graded conventional-auxetic Kirigami sandwich structures: Flatwise compression and edgewise loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 59, pp. 33-42, (2014); Yao, Yongtao, Fabrication and characterization of auxetic shape memory composite foams, Composites Part B: Engineering, 152, pp. 1-7, (2018); Miller, Wayne, Honeycomb cores with enhanced buckling strength, Composite Structures, 93, 3, pp. 1072-1077, (2011); Physics World","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

This study investigated the mechanical performance and failure characteristics of aircrew helmets constructed from 3D woven structural composite materials. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate a dual-layer helmet design comprising a 3D woven solid shell and a 3D woven honeycomb liner. The material properties and structural modelling were derived from 3D x-ray tomography and dynamic impact analysis techniques. The FEA simulations, performed via LS-DYNA software, incorporated critical properties such as the Young’s modulus, shear modulus, compressive and tensile strengths. The accuracy of these simulations was validated through comparisons with experimental results, with a focus on metrics such as helmet deformation, impact energy absorption, and head injury criteria (HIC) values. The results indicate that the 3D woven honeycomb liner significantly enhances energy absorption and load distribution, particularly in impact scenarios with energies between 60 and 90 J. This study highlights the efficacy of the honeycomb structure in mitigating impact damage and improving helmet safety. The simulations demonstrated an effective load distribution and minimal discrepancies from experimental data, validating the proposed model.

A validated finite element model is employed to investigate the crashworthiness of the FHH, with a focus on the impact of wall thickness, bifurcation factor, and bifurcation angle. The findings reveal that wall thickness has the most significant influence on crashworthiness. Increasing the wall thickness not only enhances the specific energy absorption of the FHH but also leads to a higher initial peak impact force. Notably, FHHs with a 90° bifurcation angle exhibit superior impact resistance, and both FHH-II and FHH-III demonstrate enhanced impact resistance with a bifurcation factor ξ of 2/3.

This study investigates 3D-printed polylactic acid components as mechanical absorbers, focusing on their performance enhancement through thermal post-processing and topology optimization. A key challenge in additive manufacturing is the presence of thermal gradients, which affect interlayer bonding and reduce mechanical strength. Thermal annealing was applied to printed components to address this, significantly improving their crushing resistance. Experimental results showed a 40.6% increase in energy absorption for a simple crash box and a 12.5% improvement for a honeycomb structure. Finite element simulations were used to model the crushing process and guide geometry optimization. The combination of post-processing and optimized lattice structures led to a 32-fold increase in peak crushing force, with only a fivefold increase in component weight.

Additionally, it provides the first analytical assessment of the nonlinear forced vibration behavior of composite rectangular sandwich plates with various lattice core geometric patterns under uniform compressive loading. The plate consists of a central lattice core and symmetric homogeneous face plates. Using the first-order shear deformation theory, the partial differential equations of motion are derived via Hamilton’s principle and von Kármán’s nonlinear strain–displacement relations. These equations are then reduced to time-dependent nonlinear ordinary differential equations using the Galerkin method. Primary and secondary resonances are analyzed using the method of multiple scales. The analytically obtained nonlinear primary resonances are validated against the Runge–Kutta numerical method, demonstrating excellent agreement. Secondary resonances, including superharmonic and subharmonic types that introduce new dynamic response frequencies as multiples or fractions of the primary frequencies, are also investigated. These resonances significantly influence the stability and dynamic performance of sandwich plates and play a key role in optimizing their design. This study further examines the effects of key parameters, including rib thickness, core height, and stiffener angles, on vibration amplitude and frequency response curves.

In this study, sodium ions (Na⁺) and potassium ions (K⁺) as monovalent metal ions, along with lead ions (Pb2⁺) and zinc ions (Zn2⁺) as divalent metal ions, were selected as metal ion contaminants. The focus was to investigate their effects on the microstructural morphology, macroscopic engineering properties, and electrical properties of the clays. The aim of the study is to clarify the relationship between the valence state and concentration of these four types of metal ions and the engineering properties of clay, and to predict the engineering properties of metal-ion-contaminated clay using resistivity parameters. The results indicate that the incorporation of metal ions reduces the average particle size, transforming the soil structure from flaky to a honeycomb form. Under the same loading conditions, metal-ion-contaminated clay exhibits a lower void ratio. As the concentration of metal ions increases, pore volume decreases, thereby enhancing soil compressibility. Alkali metal ions primarily influence the soil structure through a dispersive effect, while heavy metal ions exert a cohesive effect. Monovalent alkali metal-ion-contaminated clay demonstrates larger compression coefficients across all load levels, whereas heavy metal-contaminated soils exhibit higher compression coefficients under low loads. Furthermore, the shear strength and cohesion of metal-ion-contaminated clay are lower than those of field-state clay. At lower concentrations, the internal friction angle may exceed that of field-state clay; however, as the concentration of metal ions increases, the shear strength, internal friction angle, and cohesion significantly decrease. The presence of metal ions also reduces soil resistivity, which declines at a diminishing rate with increasing concentration. At lower ion concentrations, monovalent alkali metal ions have a slightly stronger effect on reducing resistivity compared to divalent heavy metal ions. Resistivity parameters effectively reflect the compressibility and shear characteristics of metal-ion-contaminated clay, revealing a negative linear correlation between resistivity and compression ratio under uniaxial loading, while a positive linear correlation exists with shear strength, internal friction angle, and cohesion. These insights provide a basis for the rapid evaluation of engineering characteristics in metal-ion-contaminated clay. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Contaminated clay; Engineering characteristics; Metal ion; Quantitative evaluation; Resistivity","Air quality standards; Biomedical materials; Biospherics; Chemical elements; Climate change; Compressive strength; Contamination; Crystal orientation; Dams; Ecosystems; Energy conservation; Environmental design; Environmental management; Geosynthetic materials; Geothermal energy; Green computing; High temperature applications; High temperature testing; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Laser diagnostics; Limnology; Mechanical testing; Nondestructive examination; Safety factor; Safety testing; Seepage; Shear strength; Soil structure interactions; Sustainable development; Temperature scales; Tribology; Water conservation; Water resources; Alkali-metal ions; Contaminated clays; Engineering characteristics; Engineering properties; Heavy metal ion; Internal friction angle; Metals ions; Quantitative evaluation; Resistivity; Shears strength; Compressibility; alkali; copper; heavy metal; lead; metal ion; potassium; zinc; clay soil; concentration (composition); electrical resistivity; experimental study; friction; particle size; quantitative analysis; shear strength; soil pollution; void ratio; Article; engineering; finite element analysis; pollution; scanning electron microscopy; soil analysis; soil quality; structure analysis; X ray diffraction","Hasegawa, Hiroshi, Environmental Remediation Technologies for Metal-Contaminated Soils, pp. 1-254, (2015); Alao, Joseph Omeiza, Geoelectrical resistivity and geochemistry monitoring of landfill leachates due to the seasonal variations and the implications on groundwater systems and public health, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Amani, Sohrab, Investigation of the Effectiveness of Electrical Resistivity Tomography in Monitoring and Detecting Hydrocarbon Contamination in Sandy Soil at Various Moisture: Pilot Scale, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 235, 3, (2024); Trans AIME, (1942); Aydi, Abdelwaheb, Environmental risk assessment of soil contamination from olive mill wastewater using electrical resistivity tomography, International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 20, 9, pp. 10013-10020, (2023); Bradl, Heike B., Adsorption of heavy metal ions on soils and soils constituents, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 277, 1, pp. 1-18, (2004); Journal of Engineering Geology, (2024); Chu, Ya, Physical and Microscopic Characteristics Experiments with Heavy Metal Polluted Cohesive Soil, Geotechnical Special Publication, 2016-January, 273 GSP, pp. 42-52, (2016); Chu, Ya, Estimation of heavy metal-contaminated soils’ mechanical characteristics using electrical resistivity, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24, 15, pp. 13561-13575, (2017); Detho, Amir, Heavy Metal Characteristics of Soil and Leachate Resistivity Mapping of Malacca Landfill, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 235, 2, (2024)",""

Origami-inspired metamaterials represent one avenue for design and optimisation of these materials, offering a large geometric design space and a range of unique properties. Potential applications for these materials include shock and vibration attenuation, blast protection, impact energy absorption, deployable and reconfigurable structures, soft robotics, and many others. In order to most effectively utilise the broad design space offered by these materials, effective and efficient material models must be developed. Analytical modelling offers an attractive route for probing such a broad design space more rapidly and at a lower computational cost versus, for example, finite element methods. In this paper the small-strain elastic behaviour of origami-inspired honeycombs that employ the “symmetric diamond Miura-ori” cell geometry is modelled analytically for both in-plane and out-of-plane loading. This analytical model contains two modelling parameters, k¯<inf>1</inf> and k¯<inf>2</inf>, which will are determined using finite element analysis through a curve-fitting process. The finite element modelling includes a comprehensive study of shell elements vs continuum tetrahedral elements, domain size effects, as well as the influence of loading direction on adherence to folding kinematics. Following the calibration of k¯<inf>1</inf> and k¯<inf>2</inf>, the analytical model is used to explore the large design space characteristic of the origami-inspired honeycombs. A high degree of independent tunability of the elastic moduli emerges spanning orders of magnitude. Special cases including tuning of elastic moduli at a constant relative density, tunability of relative density at a constant modulus, and cases of both transverse and full isotropy were investigated and discussed. In this work a novel analytical model is developed, validated by FE analysis, and used to explore the vast design space of these origami-inspired honeycombs. This work also develops further understanding of the FE modelling of small-strain elasticity of these origami-inspired structures. This work highlights the power and efficacy of the novel analytical model for the precise design of highly tunable materials, as well as provide important insights into the FE modelling of the small-strain elasticity of these materials. © 2025 The Authors","Analytical modelling; Anisotropy; Elasticity; Miura-inspired honeycomb; Property tunability; Uniaxial loading","Metamaterials; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Analytical modeling; Design spaces; FE modeling; Miurum-inspired honeycomb; Property; Property tunability; Relative density; Small strains; Tunabilities; Uni-axial loading; Honeycomb structures","Tan, Xiaojun, Bioinspired Flexible and Programmable Negative Stiffness Mechanical Metamaterials, Advanced Intelligent Systems, 5, 6, (2023); Zhang, Kai, Buckling induced negative stiffness mechanical metamaterial for bandgap tuning, Composite Structures, 304, (2023); Mei, Chaosheng, On band gap and damping of metamaterials involving negative-stiffness elements, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 239, (2023); Tan, Xiaojun, Tuning negative stiffness mechanical metamaterial's snap-through behavior with a series-connected spring, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 107, (2024); Zhu, Shaowei, Negative stiffness metamaterial with directional stability in uniform fields, Thin-Walled Structures, 194, (2024); Sang, Sheng, A design of active elastic metamaterials with negative mass density and tunable bulk modulus, Acta Mechanica, 230, 3, pp. 1003-1008, (2019); Chen, Yangyang, A hybrid elastic metamaterial with negative mass density and tunable bending stiffness, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 105, pp. 179-198, (2017); Gao, Yuqiang, Active multifunctional composite metamaterials with negative effective mass density and negative effective modulus, Composite Structures, 291, (2022); Yao, Yongtao, Fabrication and characterization of shape memory auxetic metamaterial, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 34, 1, pp. 101-110, (2023); Liu, Yuheng, 3D printing shape memory polymer of laminated multi-component metamaterial towards optimization of auxetic and shape recovery behaviors, Smart Materials and Structures, 32, 2, (2023)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

To address this research gap, the present study investigates the shear strength behavior of honeycomb beams and evaluates the reinforcing effects of floor slabs on this failure mode. A detailed mechanical performance analysis was conducted on eight honeycomb (composite) beam specimens and 246 finite element models. The study systematically examines the influence of various parameters, including floor slab dimensions (width and thickness), opening characteristics (opening ratio and shape), and steel beam flange properties, on the bearing capacity, failure modes, and strain distribution of honeycomb beams. The findings indicate that all specimens exhibit hole-edge tearing as the primary failure mechanism following shear strength failure. Honeycomb beams with circular and hexagonal openings demonstrate significantly higher shear bearing capacities compared to those with rectangular openings. Among the factors investigated, the opening shape exerts a more substantial influence on bearing capacity than the opening ratio. Additionally, concrete floor slabs effectively mitigate shear deformation in honeycomb beams. Notably, the shear bearing capacity of honeycomb composite beams is significantly higher than that of honeycomb beams, with the most pronounced increase—up to 93.1 %—observed in honeycomb composite beams with rectangular openings. Furthermore, the thickness of the floor slab has a more significant impact on the bearing capacity than its width. Based on these findings, calculation formulas for predicting the shear strength of honeycomb beams and honeycomb composite beams are proposed. These formulas provide accurate estimations of shear bearing capacity under strength failure modes, offering valuable guidance for design and engineering applications. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge and serves as a reference for the design and analysis of honeycomb beams and honeycomb composite beams. © 2025","Bending-shear interaction; Failure mechanism; Honeycomb beam; Honeycomb composite beam; Shear bearing capacity","Bending strength; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Failure modes; Floors; Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Shear strain; Shear strength; Shear stress; Steel beams and girders; Structural design; Wooden beams and girders; Bending-shear interactions; Composite beam; Failure mechanism; Floor slabs; Honeycomb beam; Honeycomb composite; Honeycomb composite beam; Shear bearing capacity; Shears strength; Strength failures; Honeycomb structures","Geng, Kai, Experimental study on the mechanical behaviour of castellated composite beams under a negative bending moment, Structures, 47, pp. 953-965, (2023); França, Gabriela M., An appraisal of the Vierendeel mechanism capacity of cellular beams with sinusoidal openings, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 198, (2022); Dong, Yang, Experimental study on seismic behavior of steel structure with cellular beams and composite concrete slab, Structures, 34, pp. 507-522, (2021); Dai, Xianghe, Numerical study of steel–concrete composite cellular beam using demountable shear connectors, Structures, 51, pp. 1328-1340, (2023); Tsavdaridis, Konstantinos Daniel, Cellular beam end-posts with two connection types, end notches and infill plates, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 215, (2024); Jia, Lianguang, Influence of the local buckling of web on the bearing capacity of a castellated beam/composite beam under pure bending, Structures, 63, (2024); Wang, Peijun, Vertical shear buckling capacity of web-posts in castellated steel beams with fillet corner hexagonal web openings, Engineering Structures, 75, pp. 315-326, (2014); Kerdal, Djamel Eddine, Failure modes for castellated beams, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 4, 4, pp. 295-315, (1984); Zirakian, Tadeh, Distortional buckling of castellated beams, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 62, 9, pp. 863-871, (2006); Tsavdaridis, Konstantinos Daniel, Experimental behaviour of non-seismical RWS connections with perforated beams under cyclic actions, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 183, (2021)",""

Auxetic honeycomb structures, recognized for their excellent mechanical performance and high design flexibility, present a promising alternative. Therefore, this present study aims to design a gradient auxetic circular tube (ACT) by adjusting the number of radial honeycomb layers. The structure's bending performance, deformation patterns, and energy absorption capabilities are evaluated through three-point bending tests and finite element simulations. The influences of auxetic effect, number of honeycomb cells, cell wall thickness, re-entrant angle, loading position and speed on the bending performance are systematically evaluated. The results demonstrate that the ACT structure exhibits greater energy absorption and load-bearing performance than the non-auxetic circular tube. Specifically, there is an enhancement in specific energy absorption (SEA) by 6.2 %. For given inner and outer diameters, the energy absorption performance increases with the layer count of the auxetic honeycomb. The addition of cells to the ACT structure can enhance its auxetic effect and bending performance. A thicker cell wall can effectively boost both energy absorption performance and load-bearing capacity. The bending resistance is improved with an increase in the re-entrant angle. The effects of different loading positions on the structure are examined, and the optimal loading position is identified. As the loading speed increases, the ACT structure shows higher plateau force and better energy absorption performance. The research results present a new design approach for achieving lightweight tubular structures with high specific strength and energy absorption performance. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorption; Gradient auxetic honeycomb; Three-point bending; Tubular structure","Bearings (structural); Bending (deformation); Bending strength; Bending tests; Absorption performance; Auxetics; Bending performance; Circular tubes; Energy; Gradient auxetic honeycomb; Point energies; Three-points bending; Tube-structure; Tubular structures; Honeycomb structures","Lou, Jia, A graded acoustic metamaterial rod enabling ultra-broadband vibration attenuation and rainbow reflection, Thin-Walled Structures, 198, (2024); Gao, Dianwei, Experimental and numerical investigation on in-plane impact behaviour of chiral auxetic structure, Composite Structures, 267, (2021); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic polymers: a new range of materials, Endeavour, 15, 4, pp. 170-174, (1991); Wang, Yifan, Energy absorption characteristics of carbon fiber reinforced plastic/aluminum hybrid materials double arrow-head auxetic structure, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 26, 4, pp. 490-506, (2024); Guo, Zhuoyu, Multi-scale characterization and in-plane crushing behavior of the elliptical anti-chiral honeycomb, Composite Structures, 303, (2023); Wang, Weijing, Energy absorption characteristics of a lightweight auxetic honeycomb under low-velocity impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 185, (2023); Li, Zichuan, Improving thermomechanical properties of cracked brittle honeycombs by negative Poisson's ratio effect, Composite Structures, 266, (2021); Liu, Shuo, Buckling and vibration characteristic of anisotropic sandwich plates with negative Poisson’s ratio based on isogeometric analysis, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 23, pp. 5869-5884, (2024); Xu, Peilei, Compression behavior of 4D printed metamaterials with various Poisson's ratios, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 264, (2024); Zhao, Guoqi, Preparation and compressive properties of cementitious composites reinforced by 3D printed cellular structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, Developments in the Built Environment, 17, (2024)",""

This work focuses on the numerical analysis of hierarchically built hybrid composite structures intended for electric vehicle battery casings. Using finite element analysis (FEA), the impact response of newly designed hybrid multifunctional composite materials under impact loading was investigated. After defining composite formulations based on structural and thermal management demands, representative volume elements (RVEs) were created to determine the elastic constants of the composite compositions. Concurrently with the numerical investigations, the composites were manufactured, impact tests were conducted. Response surface methodology and multi-objective optimization identified an optimal formulation, considering elastic modulus, impact strength, and cost. The optimum composite formulation was then subjected to impact simulations using Abaqus CAE software. Three different scenarios were investigated: one with a box-shaped aluminium battery module case, one with a box-shaped composite battery module case, and one with honeycomb features integrated into the box-shaped composite battery module case.

The elastic properties of two-phase (Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf>Tx-MXene-MWCNT)/epoxy sandwich composite were evaluated by utilizing the Halpin-Tsai method. Then, glass fiber was incorporated as reinforcement, and the elastic characteristics of the hybridized three phase composite were obtained using the Chamis analytical model. The vibration behavior of sandwich panels was investigated with the help of finite element formulation by obtaining the strain fields using high-order shear deformation theory. The developed numerical model was experimentally validated, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting the natural frequencies of sandwich composite panels under varying conditions. Nano-filler reinforcement consistently increased natural frequencies across all vibration modes, regardless of boundary conditions. A parametric study revealed that natural frequency monotonically increased with higher aspect ratio and weight fraction of MWCNTs and Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf>T<inf>x</inf>-MXene. However, the thickness ratio had a significantly greater effect on natural frequency than other parameters. Clamping conditions also affected vibration behavior, with natural frequencies following the order: CFFF < SSSS < SFSF < CFCF < CSCS < CCCC. Regarding the transverse response, the root mean square velocity decreased with increasing MXene/CNT concentration and aspect ratio, attributed to enhanced stiffness and load-bearing capacity of the hybrid sandwich composite. This study offers valuable insights for effective utilization of different types of nanoparticles in conjunction and design and development of nanoparticle-reinforced sandwich composites, aiding in the prediction of the vibration behavior of these nanostructures.

This paper investigates the enhancing performance of a novel dual-directional graded honeycomb called modularized honeycomb (MH) under dynamic loading conditions. Finite element (FE) models of MH are developed and validated through drop weight impact tests. A theoretical model for predicting the dynamic plateau stress of MH is also derived. By analyzing both FE and theoretical results, it is concluded that for any average relative density and graded coefficient, the strength and specific plastic energy absorption of MH increase with crushing velocity, and MH consistently outperforms that of uniform honeycomb (UH). However, the enhancement coefficient, i.e., strength ratio between MH and UH, decreases as increasing crushing velocity. The underlying mechanism for this is uncovered based on the design principle and the theoretical model. Moreover, the enhancement coefficient and energy ratio exhibit insensitivity to average relative density under dynamic loadings. Overall, this paper reveals enhancement effects of modularized design on dynamic crushing behaviors of MH and provides insights into the differences between MH and UH, which could benefit development of excellent lightweight energy absorbers. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS","Crushing behaviors; Dual-directional gradients; Enhanced properties; Honeycomb","Dynamic loads; Honeycomb structures; Crushing behaviors; Dual-directional gradient; Dynamic crushing; Enhanced properties; Enhancement coefficients; Enhancement effects; Honeycomb; Modularized; Relative density; Theoretical modeling; Bulk Density","de Waal, Leo, Dynamic behaviour of graded origami honeycomb, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 157, (2021); Duan, Shengyu, Enhanced out-of-plane compressive strength and energy absorption of 3D printed square and hexagonal honeycombs with variable-thickness cell edges, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 18, pp. 9-18, (2018); Fang, Jianguang, Design of transversely-graded foam and wall thickness structures for crashworthiness criteria, Composites Part B: Engineering, 92, pp. 338-349, (2016); Gao, Yang, Graded honeycombs with high impact resistance through machine learning-based optimization, Thin-Walled Structures, 188, (2023); Geng, Furong, Low-velocity crashworthiness and optimization of a crash box filled with modularized graded honeycomb, Engineering Computations, 41, 10, pp. 2572-2593, (2024); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Hu, Lingling, Analyses on the dynamic strength of honeycombs under the y-directional crushing, Materials and Design, 53, pp. 293-301, (2014); Hu, Yiqun, Design methodology for functional gradient star-shaped honeycomb with enhanced impact resistance and energy absorption, Materials Today Communications, 38, (2024); Jiang, Feng, Fabrication and crushing response of graded re-entrant circular auxetic honeycomb, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 242, (2023); Jin, Yutong, A new calculation method of in-plane elastic properties analytical model for novel nested honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced Young's modulus, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 97, (2023)",""

This study proposes a helmet pad design based on a negative-Poisson’s-ratio (NPR) structure and comprehensively evaluates its protective effect on head injuries. A concave hexagonal honeycomb structure was embedded into the energy-absorbing lining of a motorcycle helmet, and finite element collision simulations were conducted according to the ECE R22.05 standard. These simulations compared and analyzed the differences in protective performance between concave hexagonal honeycomb helmets with different parameter configurations and traditional expanded polystyrene (EPS) helmets under flat anvil impact scenarios. Using biomechanical parameters, including peak linear acceleration (PLA), head injury criterion (HIC), intracranial pressure (ICP), maximum principal strain (MPS), and the probability of AIS2+ traumatic brain injury, the protective effect of the helmets on traumatic brain injury was evaluated. The results showed that when the wall angle of the honeycomb structure was 60°, honeycomb helmets with wall thicknesses of 0.8 mm and 1.0 mm significantly reduced PLA and HIC values. In particular, the honeycomb helmet with a wall thickness of 1.0 mm reduced ICP by 25.7%, while the honeycomb helmet with a wall thickness of 1.2 mm exhibited the lowest maximum principal strain in the skull compared to EPS helmets and reduced the probability of AIS2+ brain injury by 7.2%. Concave hexagonal honeycomb helmets demonstrated an excellent protective performance in reducing the risk of traumatic brain injury. These findings provide important theoretical foundations and engineering references for the design and optimization of new protective helmets. © 2025 by the authors.","biomechanics; craniocerebral injury protection; helmet liner; negative-Poisson’s-ratio structure; re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb","Light absorption; Craniocerebral injury protection; Head injuries; Helmet liners; Hexagonal honeycomb; Injury protections; Negative-poisson’s-ratio structure; Ratio structures; Re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb; S ratio; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Honeycomb structures","undefined; Li, Xuelin, A novel star-shaped honeycomb with enhanced energy absorption, Composite Structures, 309, (2023); Lin, Hongbin, In-plane dynamic impact behaviors of a self-similar concentric star honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio, Materials Today Communications, 33, (2022); Song, Yuhua, In-Plane Impact Performance of a Gradient Sinusoidal Negative Poisson-Ratio Honeycomb Structure, Journal of Vibration Engineering and Technologies, 13, 3, (2025); Qin, Shangan, Energy absorption characteristics and negative Poisson's ratio effect of axisymmetric tetrachiral honeycombs under in-plane impact, Composite Structures, 323, (2023); Zhu, Difeng, A novel elliptical annular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced stiffness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 262, (2024); Yu, Sheng, The compressive responses and failure behaviors of composite graded auxetic re-entrant honeycomb structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 187, (2023); Kun, Yang, Study on impact energy absorption performance and optimization of negative Poisson's ratio structure, Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 45, 6, (2023); Hai, Hong, Impact resistance of a double re-entrant negative poisson’s ratio honeycomb structure, Physica Scripta, 99, 2, (2024); Wang, Jie, A 3D re-entrant structural metamaterial with negative Poisson’s ratio reinforced by adding arrow structures, Smart Materials and Structures, 32, 3, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

To address these limitations, one promising approach is the hybridization of different auxetic structures, combining their strengths to enhance mechanical properties. This study presents and investigates such hybridization strategy combining re-entrant honeycomb, S-shaped chiral, and missing rib structures aimed at enhancing the performance of auxetic metamaterials, with a particular emphasis on improving their energy absorption (EA) capabilities and structural strength. Ten novel hybrid lattice configurations were designed and evaluated under quasi-static compression through experimental testing and finite element analysis, demonstrating strong agreement between the two approaches. Among the hybrid lattices, the S-Rmx (features an alternating sequence along the X-axis, where individual re-entrant unit cells are strategically positioned between consecutive S-shaped units) hybrid lattice outperformed the traditional re-entrant lattice, achieving 20% higher total EA and plateau stress, and 12% greater EA efficiency. Additionally, a parametric study using the central composite design approach was conducted on S-Rmx hybrid lattice to further optimize performance, with the best-performing configurations achieving up to 180% improvement in EA compared to the initial design. These findings underscore the impact of cell placement, orientation, and parametric tuning in optimizing the EA characteristics of hybrid auxetic lattices, offering insights for the design of next-generation lightweight protective structures. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The impact response characteristics and energy absorption capacity of HFRP under different impact velocities and impact angles are studied by using the explicit dynamic finite element method. The results show that the deformation mode of HFRP structure is affected by the inertia effect caused by high-speed impact; different impact angles also lead to different deformation patterns. The nominal stress–strain curve of the impact end of HFRP structure is related to the impact angle under different impact velocities and corresponds with the deformation mode. There is a coupling effect between L2 and H1; with the introduction of L2, the specific energy absorption is 91.4% higher and load-bearing capacity is 89.7% higher than that of HFRP.

These experimental trials were explicitly designed to ascertain the ballistic limit velocity (BLV) of FML reinforced AAC subjecting to impact loading of a rigid flat-nosed projectile. In conjunction with experimental investigations, an analytical model based on closed-form solutions employing energy equations was meticulously developed to offer a deeper analysis of the impact event. This analysis encompassed the identification of various damage mechanisms that manifest during high-velocity impacts, including core crushing, tensile fracture, fiber breakage, delamination, plugging and the formation of petals. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis using dimensionless variables was employed to provide a more profound insight into the influence of diverse parameters such as the mass and initial velocity of the projectile. Additionally, three-dimensional finite element method (3D FEM) simulations via the Ls-Dyna package were carried out to estimate the effects of various projectile nose shapes on ballistic performance, failure modes, energy absorption (EA), and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the target. The simulations revealed that the projectile nose shape can induce various damage mechanisms within the FMLRAAC panel. During the impact process, the E glass/epoxy composite layer undergo matrix cracking, fiber breakage occurred along with delamination, and consequently, the Al skin underwent plastic deformations until this layer fractured permanently at the impact position. As a result insulating AAC in a sandwich structure between two FML face skins reproduce a significant strength and stability. Moreover, the manufacturing of FMLRAAC in construction is a simple process to promote its structural capability especially for hazardous environment as load bearing structural material. © The Author(s) 2025.","autoclaved aerated concrete; ballistic limit velocity; Composite sandwich panels; fiber metal laminate; perforation","Compaction; Concrete slabs; Delamination; Failure modes; Fiber reinforced concrete; Fiber reinforced metals; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Paper laminates; Perforating; Sandwich structures; Sensitivity analysis; Structural analysis; Autoclaved aerated concrete; Ballistic limit velocity; Composite sandwich panels; Damage mechanism; Face skins; Fiber breakages; Fibre Metal Laminates; High-velocity impact; Perforation","Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Zhang, Guoqi, Response of sandwich structures with pyramidal truss cores under the compression and impact loading, Composite Structures, 100, pp. 451-463, (2013); Sun, Guangyong, Lightweight hybrid materials and structures for energy absorption: A state-of-the-art review and outlook, Thin-Walled Structures, 172, (2022); Quanjin, Ma, A review of the recent trends on core structures and impact response of sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 55, 18, pp. 2513-2555, (2021); Hassanpour Roudbeneh, Fatemeh, Experimental investigation of impact loading on honeycomb sandwich panels filled with foam, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 24, 2, pp. 199-210, (2019); Quek, Ser Tong, Development of functionally-graded cementitious panel against high-velocity small projectile impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 8, pp. 928-941, (2010); Xi, Huifeng, A numerical study of temperature effect on the penetration of aluminum foam sandwich panels under impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 130, pp. 217-229, (2017); Ahmadi, Hamed, High velocity impact on composite sandwich panels with nano-reinforced syntactic foam core, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); Wang, Bing, Low-velocity impact characteristics and residual tensile strength of carbon fiber composite lattice core sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 42, 4, pp. 891-897, (2011); Lu, Lingling, Effects of random damages on dynamic behavior of metallic sandwich panel with truss core, Composites Part B: Engineering, 116, pp. 278-290, (2017)",""

The glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GFPP)/DP980 honeycomb sandwich structure consists of GFPP panels with a polypropylene honeycomb core. DP980 advanced high-strength steel plate is encapsulated within the structure, inspired by fiber metal laminates. A lightweight and high-strength sandwich composite lay-up solution was determined through equivalent bending stiffness theory, finite element simulation and experiment. An asymmetric sandwich structure with the steel plate on the impacted side enhanced flexural strength and ductility, demonstrating different failure sequences and a higher bending strength of 77.64 MPa compared to 50.18 MPa when the steel plate was on the unimpacted side. As impact energy increased from 100 to 200 J, the sandwich structure showed higher peak impact load, deeper craters, and increased bulge height, with significant delamination up to 175 J, while gravel impact tests revealed minimal flexural strength reduction (4.92%) even after repeated impacts. This study confirms that the use of thermoplastic sandwich structures is a viable and promising option for crash safety and the lightweight design of battery pack bottom guards. Highlights: The thermoplastic honeycomb sandwich structure is polypropylene-based. The use of advanced high strength steel is inspired by fiber metal laminates. Both thickness and surface density are considered in the structural design. The steel plate placed on the impacted side improves the flexural behavior. The sandwich structure has excellent impact resistance and lightweight level. © 2024 Society of Plastics Engineers.","flexural properties; impact performance; polypropylene; sandwich structure; steel plate","Battery Pack; Bending strength; Bending tests; Building materials; Concrete buildings; Dams; Dynamic response; Fiber reinforced metals; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Laminated composites; Levees; Plastic laminates; Plates (structural components); Stress relief; Structural dynamics; Advanced high strength steel; Battery pack; Fiber reinforced polypropylene; Fibre Metal Laminates; Flexural properties; Glass fibre reinforced; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact performance; Low-velocity; Steel plates; Sandwich structures","Zhao, Ying, Mechanical Properties and Optimization Analysis on Battery Box with Honeycomb Sandwich Composite Structure, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 24, 1, pp. 1-14, (2023); Geisbauer, Christian, Scenarios Involving Accident-Damaged Electric Vehicles, Transportation Research Procedia, 55, pp. 1484-1489, (2021); Xu, Dongxin, Data-driven modelling and evaluation of a battery-pack system's mechanical safety against bottom cone impact, Energy, 290, (2024); Pan, Yongjun, Crush and crash analysis of an automotive battery-pack enclosure for lightweight design, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 2, pp. 500-509, (2022); Biharta, Michael Alfred Stephenson, Design and optimization of lithium-ion battery protector with auxetic honeycomb for in-plane impact using machine learning method, Frontiers in Energy Research, 11, (2023); Wang, Weiwei, Design optimization of a novel negative Poisson's ratio non-module battery pack system considering crashworthiness and heat dissipation, Composite Structures, 275, (2021); Xiang, Junxian, Joint interface optimization of all-CFRTP composite honeycomb prepared by ultrasonic multi-spot welding, Composites Science and Technology, 248, (2024); Li, Ruoxu, Bio-inspired honeycomb structures to improve the crashworthiness of a battery-pack system, Engineering Failure Analysis, 158, (2024); Yue, Zengshen, Elevated shock resistance of all-metallic sandwich beams with honeycomb-supported corrugated cores, Composites Part B: Engineering, 242, (2022); Chen, Boyue, Multifunctional cellular sandwich structures with optimised core topologies for improved mechanical properties and energy harvesting performance, Composites Part B: Engineering, 238, (2022)",""

In this regard, samples with circular, rhombic and hexagonal pore geometries were printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM), and their residual stress was measured through the mechanical strain release method. The finite-element method (FEM) was utilized to study the strength and natural frequency of the samples. Design/methodology/approach: As a modern method of part manufacturing and repair, 3D printing has been highly regarded in industrial arenas for its ability to offer high precision without the need for different dies. Porosity has been studied as a solution for reducing weight in structures, and its effect on the mechanical behavior of a structure depends on the loading conditions and applications. Findings: The results of the investigation showed that the rhombic pore geometry had the highest residual stress, while the sample with circular pores exhibited the lowest residual stress. Stress distribution and modal analyses indicated that the sample with rhombic pore geometry had the lowest displacement coupled with the highest strength and natural frequency. However, considering the total of external load-induced stress and residual stresses, the sample with hexagonal pore geometry outperformed the other samples and showed the longest fatigue life. Originality/value: According to the literature review, residual stress is one of the key factors influencing the performance of 3D-printed parts. However, the effects of pore geometry on residual stress and structural strength in 3D-printed components remain underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of hexagonal, rhombic and circular pore geometries on residual stress and structural strength through both experimental and numerical analyses. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Honeycomb structure; Mechanical characterization; Perforation geometry; Residual stress","Convergence of numerical methods; Residual stresses; Structural analysis; Deposition modeling; Experimental and numerical methods; Hexagonal pores; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical characterizations; Perforation geometry; Pore geometry; Stress behavior; Stress strength; Structural strength; Honeycomb structures","Acanfora, Valerio, Experimental investigation on 3D printed lightweight sandwich structures for energy absorption aerospace applications, Aerospace Science and Technology, 137, (2023); Ahmad, Bilal, Residual stress evaluation in selective-laser-melting additively manufactured titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) and inconel 718 using the contour method and numerical simulation, Additive Manufacturing, 22, pp. 571-582, (2018); Alzyod, Hussein, Correlation Between Printing Parameters and Residual Stress in Additive Manufacturing: A Numerical Simulation Approach, Production Engineering Archives, 29, 3, pp. 279-287, (2023); Alzyod, Hussein, Rapid prediction and optimization of the impact of printing parameters on the residual stress of FDM-ABS parts using L27 orthogonal array design and FEA, Materials Today: Proceedings, 93, pp. 583-588, (2023); Azarmi, Fardad, Evaluation of the residual stresses in metallic materials produced by additive manufacturing technology: effect of microstructure, Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering, 28, pp. 21-27, (2020); J Mater Sci Eng A, (2022); Bolat, Cagın, An experimental and numerical effort on the vibration behavior of additively manufactured recycled polyethylene terephthalate glycol components, Polymer Engineering and Science, 64, 11, pp. 5815-5830, (2024); Buchbinder, Damien, Investigation on reducing distortion by preheating during manufacture of aluminum components using selective laser melting, Journal of Laser Applications, 26, 1, (2014); Shigley S Mechanical Engineering Design, (2008); Daly, Mohamed, FDM technology and the effect of printing parameters on the tensile strength of ABS parts, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 126, 11-12, pp. 5307-5323, (2023)",""

While CCF reinforcement demonstrates considerable potential for improving structural performance, comprehensive research is required to evaluate these fabricated honeycomb structures under bending loads, particularly regarding their shape-memory characteristics and reusability under cyclic loading conditions. This study investigates the response and energy absorption performance of novel reusable 3D-printed honeycomb beams reinforced with CCF under three-point bending loads through both experimental and numerical approaches. Specimens were manufactured using a dual-nozzle fused deposition modelling 3D printer by combining a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix with varying CCF volume fractions. The mechanical behaviour was characterized through force-displacement curves obtained from monotonic and cyclic three-point bending experiments. Finite element models were developed and experimentally validated to simulate the mechanical responses, enabling parametric studies of CCF volume fraction and impact velocity effects. The cyclic bending experiments demonstrated reusability, with specimens maintaining at least 61 % of their initial energy absorption capacity after 10 cycles. Impact velocity proved to be a significant factor in honeycomb beam behaviour, with higher velocities leading to increased deformation and energy absorption. However, the incorporation of CCF introduced repulsive forces that caused fluctuations in force-displacement curves at higher speeds. Higher CCF volume fractions enhanced both load-bearing capacity and energy absorption, with the highest CCF content model achieving a 7.24 % weight reduction while improving energy absorption by 59.45 %.

The test research involved parameters of the spacing and arrangement of the connector, and 4-point bending tests were conducted. The five specimens' flexural properties and composite action were analyzed, and formulas for calculating the cracking load and ultimate bearing capacity of such fully composite panels were proposed. Finite element models were established for parameter analysis, including the ratio of the total rib width of the connector (b<inf>rib</inf>) to the panel width (b) (b<inf>rib</inf>/b), the ratio of the rib width (b<inf>0</inf>) to spacing (S) of a single concrete rib connector (b<inf>0</inf>/S), and the ratio of the connector thickness (t<inf>2</inf>) to the panel thickness (t) (t<inf>2</inf>/t).

The experimental study was conducted to investigate the hail's behavior upon impact on rigid structures and, subsequently, to assess the failure modes of sandwich structures under repeated hail impacts. The objective was to develop a suitable numerical model for studying the response of sandwich structures under multiple and random hail impacts. The sandwich panel, which consisted of four layers of woven glass epoxy as the face sheet and a Nomex honeycomb layer with a thickness of 16 mm as a core, was tested for its resilience to repeated hail impacts with 5, 10, 15, and 20 impacts. Four failure mechanisms were observed in the sandwich plate, including delamination growth at the top face sheet and three types of failure in the core. The core failures, initiated with wrinkling of the core walls, progressed to wall rupturing at higher impacts and, after 15 impacts, separated the face sheet from the core. Numerical models were then deployed to investigate the effects of hail size in a single impact and the effect of the random distribution of multiple hail impacts. The severity of damage caused by multiple impacts from lower-energy hail (30 mm in size at 21 m/s) was in a similar level as damage from a single impact by higher-energy hail (>40 mm in size at 30 m/s). The damage was almost initiated after eight impacts under the site © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Damage; Finite elements method; Hail impacts; Honeycomb sandwich panel; Random distribution","Core disruptive accidents; Honeycomb structures; Rigid structures; Structural panels; Damage; Element method; Experimental and numerical studies; Face sheets; Failure mechanism; Hail impact; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Nomex honeycombs; Random distribution; Sandwich panel; Sandwich structures","Sandwich Structures 7 Advancing with Sandwich Structures and Materials, (2005); Hedayati, Reza, Mechanical properties of additively manufactured thick honeycombs, Materials, 9, 8, (2016); Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Torkestani, Ahad, Effect of material type, stacking sequence and impact location on the pedestrian head injury in collisions, Thin-Walled Structures, 97, pp. 130-139, (2015); Hedayati, Reza, Foam-core effect on the integrity of tailplane leading edge during bird-strike event, Journal of Aircraft, 48, 6, pp. 2080-2089, (2011); Qin, Qinghua, Structural impact damage of metal honeycomb sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 252, (2020); Xie, Honglei, Low-velocity impact damage detection and characterization in composite sandwich panels using infrared thermography, Composite Structures, 269, (2021); Hedayati, Reza, Effect of using an inner plate between two faces of a sandwich structure in resistance to bird-strike impact, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 29, 1, (2016); Forensic Engineering Damage Assessments for Residential and Commercial Structures, (2013); undefined, (2021)",""

An increased thickness of expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulation is inserted between the ribbed concrete exterior panels joined by the connectors to resist flexural moment collaboratively. Six specimens were designed to study the sandwich wall panel's mechanical properties, including component tests under axial pull-out and compressive loads, double shear, and full-scale wall panel bending tests. The component test results indicate that the new type of connectors demonstrate good anchoring performance with concrete and shear transfer ability, and the full-scale bending test reveals that the exterior concrete panels achieve a complete composite mechanical performance before failure. A finite element model is established and validated using the test data. The study focused on examining the impact of the ratio between the area of concrete ribs and the area of the connectors (). Based on the experimental and numerical results, the Degree of Composite Action (DCA) is discussed, and a simplified stress-strain relationship is utilized to build a series of analysis models for determining the cracking resistance and ultimate flexural capacity.

In this study, innovative B-spline honeycombs (BSHs) were developed to represent a variety of polyline/curve hexagonal honeycombs. The energy absorption performance of the BSHs was assessed using the finite element method, validated by quasi-static compression experiments. The developed data-driven optimization design framework integrates deep neural network models and genetic algorithms, enabling the generation of novel BSHs that fulfill specific design criteria. Using this framework, the upper specific energy absorption boundary of BSHs was determined to identify configurations with the highest specific energy absorption across varying relative densities. Additionally, empirical equations to compute the maximum initial peaking compression force, mean compression force, and specific energy absorption of BSHs at specific relative densities were summarized. These optimized BSHs were categorized into bowl-shaped BSHs, 30-sided BSHs, 5-shaped BSHs, 2-shaped BSHs, M-shaped BSHs, and r-shaped BSHs based on their topological structures. The BSH with the highest specific energy absorption, 13.4 J/g, belonged to the 5-shaped BSHs category, with a corresponding relative density of 9.15 %. The predominant deformation mode for these optimized BSHs, ensuring maximal material utilization, was identified as perfect folding mode. Compared to traditional hexagonal honeycomb and other polyline/curve hexagonal configurations at equivalent relative densities, the BSHs exhibited superior energy absorption capabilities. This study offers a systematic design approach for future endeavors aimed at developing high energy absorbing honeycombs with more intricate cross-sectional shapes. © 2025","Empirical equation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb; Machine learning; Optimization design","Deep neural networks; Honeycomb structures; Machine design; Sandwich structures; Splines; B splines; Data-driven optimization; Empirical equations; Energy; Energy absorption capability; Honeycomb; Machine-learning; Optimization design; Relative density; Specific energy absorption; Bulk Density","Shifa, Madni, Mechanical and electrical properties of hybrid honeycomb sandwich structure for spacecraft structural applications, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 1, pp. 222-240, (2021); Ganilova, Olga A., Experimental investigation of the thermoelastic performance of an aerospace aluminium honeycomb composite panel, Composite Structures, 257, (2021); Goyal, Vinay K., Proof test methodology for reducing the risk of unvented honeycomb core failures in aerospace structures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 25, 1, pp. 61-76, (2023); Hou, Wenbinw Bin, Study on mechanical properties of carbon fiber honeycomb curved sandwich structure and its application in engine hood, Composite Structures, 286, (2022); Upadhyaya, Shravan, Synthesis and characterization of honeycomb sandwiched composite material for automobile applications, Materials Today: Proceedings, 54, pp. 502-506, (2021); Amraei, Mohsen, Application of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panel as an energy absorber of high-speed train nose, Journal of Composite Materials, 48, 9, pp. 1027-1037, (2014); Garbatov, Yordan Y., Flexural response of additive-manufactured honeycomb sandwiches for marine structural applications, Ocean Engineering, 302, (2024); He, Yinchuan, Design and mechanical properties analysis of hexagonal perforated honeycomb metamaterial, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 270, (2024); Deng, Yun, Dual-Phase Inspired Soft Electronic Sensors with Programmable and Tunable Mechanical Properties, ACS Nano, 17, 7, pp. 6423-6434, (2023); Guo, Yanfeng, Shock absorbing characteristics and vibration transmissibility of honeycomb paperboard, Shock and Vibration, 11, 5-6, pp. 521-531, (2004)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The structure demonstrated excellent energy absorption performance. Quasi-static compression tests were first conducted to investigate the failure mechanisms and energy absorption characteristics of locally densified aluminum honeycomb panels and cylindrical shells under axial loads, assessing the effectiveness of local densification in enhancing energy absorption. Based on the experimental results, the deformation mechanism and load transfer paths of the locally densified honeycomb were analyzed. Finite element simulations were then employed to systematically explore the effects of geometric parameters, including cell wall thickness, cell size, and thickness-to-diameter ratio, on the energy absorption performance of the densified aluminum honeycomb cylindrical shells. The results showed that compared to regular honeycomb panels and cylindrical shells, the locally densified structures significantly improved absorbed energy, specific energy absorption, mean crushing force and crush force efficiency. The absorbed and specific energy absorption of the densified cylindrical shell increased by up to 76.50 % and 25.64 %, respectively. Cell wall thickness had the greatest impact on energy absorption, with a 203.57 % increase in specific energy absorption achieved by increasing wall thickness. Excellent energy absorption performance is achieved by a simple fabrication process alone.

Different Poisson's ratios and densities are considered to evaluate the impact of these parameters on the deformation mechanisms under uniaxial compression loading. The numerical analysis is performed using the Riks method, while considering geometric nonlinearity and elastoplastic behavior. The results indicate that negative Poisson's ratio and structure density have a significant influence on the buckling critical stress and the failure mechanisms of cellular structures. Although the inverted honeycomb and the double arrowhead with different Poisson's ratios exhibit similar load capacity, facesheet failure is more pronounced with the conventional inverted honeycomb. This result can be attributed to the dominant effect of the facesheet on the load evolution.

However, the stiffness of auxetic structures is generally lower than solid structures due to the presence of voids. This study investigates the impact of foam filling as a novel approach on the flexural properties of chiral cellular sandwich structures. Four chiral cores, including Re-entrant Trichiral (RTH), Re-entrant Anti-Trichiral (RATH), Trichiral (TH), and Anti-Trichiral Honeycombs (ATH), were considered. Both experimental three-point bending tests and finite element analysis were conducted to evaluate the effects of foam filling on energy absorption, flexural modulus, and strength. The results demonstrate a significant increase in energy absorption (ranging from 8.33 % to 13.68 %) and flexural modulus (ranging from 24.45 % to 69.17 %) for all foam-filled structures. The RTH and RATH configurations exhibited superior performance due to their greater deflection capacity and stiffness. Foam filling also reduced face sheet yielding and improved stress distribution, leading to enhanced post-yield behavior, although the specific benefits of foam filling varied based on the chiral core design. Failure analysis revealed that foam filling introduced new failure mechanisms, primarily involving foam debonding and cracking. Foam-filled structures maintained overall structural integrity and exhibited improved flexural strength, with increases ranging from 5.81 % to 28.94 %, compared to their hollow counterparts. The findings of this study suggest that foam-filled chiral sandwich structures offer a promising approach for enhancing the mechanical performance of lightweight structures in applications requiring high energy absorption and stiffness. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Failure; Flexural properties; Foam-filled; Trichiral honeycombs","Bending strength; Bending tests; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Light weight structures; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Auxetic structures; Energy; Flexural modulus; Flexural properties; Foam filled; Foam-filled structures; Mechanical performance; Trichiral honeycomb; Sandwich structures","Alomarah, Amer, Compressive properties of a modified re-entrant chiral auxetic structure (MRCA) under uniaxial quasi-static loading, Smart Materials and Structures, 33, 5, (2024); Najafi, Milad, Investigation on the flexural properties of sandwich beams with auxetic core, Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 44, 2, (2022); Ha, Ngoc-san, Energy absorption of a bio-inspired honeycomb sandwich panel, Journal of Materials Science, 54, 8, pp. 6286-6300, (2019); Montazeri, Amin, Enhancing the compressive properties of re-entrant honeycombs by line defects with insight from nature, Materials Today Communications, 38, (2024); Wu, Wenwang, Mechanical design and multifunctional applications of chiral mechanical metamaterials: A review, Materials and Design, 180, (2019); Li, Dong, The properties of copper foams with negative Poisson's ratio via resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 250, 10, pp. 1983-1987, (2013); Wang, Weijing, Energy absorption characteristics of a lightweight auxetic honeycomb under low-velocity impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 185, (2023); Hao, Jian, A novel compression-torsion coupling metamaterial with tunable Poisson's ratio, Construction and Building Materials, 395, (2023); Kolken, Helena M.A., Auxetic mechanical metamaterials, RSC Advances, 7, 9, pp. 5111-5129, (2017); Parisi, Mariafederica F., Indentation and impact response of conventional, auxetic, and shear thickening gel infused auxetic closed cell foam, Smart Materials and Structures, 32, 7, (2023)",""

Consequently, a comprehensive examination of their mechanical behavior becomes imperative. This study delves into the free vibration characteristics of a three-layer cylindrical shell containing liquid. The central layer of this structure features a re-entrant honeycomb auxetic pattern, while the inner and outer layers are assumed to be isotropic and constructed from aluminum. The liquid within the shell is considered ideal and incompressible, with no consideration for wave effects on its free surface. To model this problem, we employ a modified high-order shear deformation theory (HSDT). By applying Hamilton's principle, we derive fundamental equations and solve them using the Galerkin weighted residual method. We compare our findings with results published in authoritative articles and outcomes obtained from finite element analysis in ABAQUS to validate them. Our investigation explores the impact of various parameters on the natural frequencies of the cylindrical body. These parameters include the geometrical dimensions of the sandwich cylindrical cover, adjustable auxetic core parameters, and liquid characteristics. Given the widespread use of cylindrical sandwich shells across diverse industries, our study provides valuable insights into the phenomenon of free vibration in these structures.

The introduction of an additional layer improves the strength and stiffness of scarf-repaired structures, but poor surface smoothness and larger uneven stress distribution occur after the dimensions of the additional layer increase to a certain extent. Hence, the optimal design of an additional layer is considered in the scarf-repaired structure to improve the load-bearing performance. The finite element models of scarf-repaired structures with and without an additional layer are established based on the 3D Hashin failure criterion, and the bending performance analysis is performed to obtain the maximum bearing load. An optimization model with the side length, thickness, and carbon fiber ply angle of the additional layer as design variables and the maximum bearing load as the design objective is built, and then is solved by the Response Surface Method (RSM). Three-point bending tests are conducted on the scarf-repaired carbon fiber composite-aramid paper honeycomb sandwich structures with and without an optimized additional layer. The results indicate that the optimized additional layer has made the load-bearing performance and deformation capacity of the scarf-repaired honeycomb sandwich structure significantly improve, that is, has effectively alleviate the stress concentration in the connection area between the patch and original structure. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2025.","additional layer optimization; Honeycomb Sandwich Structure; scarf repair","Bending strength; Bending tests; Carbon fibers; Failure (mechanical); Loads (forces); Optimal systems; Repair; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Stress concentration; Structural design; Structural optimization; Additional layer optimization; Bearing loads; Bending properties; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Load-bearing performance; Optimal design; Optimisations; Original structures; Patch structure; Scarf repair; Honeycomb structures","Hanlon, Damien, Liquid exfoliation of solvent-stabilized few-layer black phosphorus for applications beyond electronics, Nature Communications, 6, (2015); Krzyzak, Aneta, Sandwich Structured Composites for Aeronautics: Methods of Manufacturing Affecting Some Mechanical Properties, International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 2016, (2016); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Zhang, Chao, Low-velocity impact response and compression after impact behavior of tubular composite sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 193, (2020); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); Coelho, Sara R.M., Effects of external patch configuration on repaired composite laminates subjected to multi-impacts, Composite Structures, 168, pp. 259-265, (2017); Truong, Viethoai, Cohesive zone method for failure analysis of scarf patch-repaired composite laminates under bending load, Composite Structures, 222, (2019); Campilho, Raul D.S.G.

It examines the evolution of bumper technology from steel structures to advanced composites, analyzing their impact on vehicle performance and crash safety. The research evaluates various materials for bumper components, including aluminium alloys, ABS plastics, carbon fiber-reinforced plastics for the body, and expanded polypropylene and polyethylene foam for energy absorbers. The study simulates bumper performance under low-velocity impact conditions using computer-aided design and finite element analysis. Three energy absorption geometries-triangular, diamond, and honeycomb structures-are assessed for crash scenarios. The paper highlights trade-offs between design complexity, manufacturing considerations, and energy absorption performance. This comprehensive study contributes to the understanding of bumper design optimization, material selection, and performance evaluation, offering valuable insights for automotive engineers developing next-generation vehicle safety systems. The main findings indicate that ABS polymer is the best material for bumper bodies because it offers the best impact resistance and the least amount of deformation while achieving significant weight reduction as compared to conventional materials. Although production difficulty must be taken into account, the best strength absorption and deformation characteristics in electricity absorber design are shown by the hexagonal cross-sectional shape in vertical orientation. While polyethylene foam performs well in prolonged impact situations, expanded polypropylene is more effective for initial impact absorption in power absorbers, indicating the possibility of hybrid solutions in future designs. © 2025, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

This study introduces a biomimetic modular honeycomb configuration inspired by the variable-density biological enhancement characteristics of tree stem tissues. This study examined the out-of-plane compressive behavior and mechanical characteristics of modular honeycomb structures. A numerical model of the modular honeycomb was constructed utilizing finite element technology, enabling simulation studies at varying impact velocities. The improved weight-bearing and impact-absorbing properties of modular honeycomb structures are investigated using theoretical analysis and computer simulations. It also scrutinizes the effects of boundary and matching conditions on the honeycomb’s performance. The results indicate that adjusting the thickness of the walls in both the matrix honeycomb and sub-honeycomb structures can substantially improve their resistance to low-velocity out-of-plane compression impacts. Furthermore, the energy absorption capacity of modular honeycombs during high-velocity impacts is significantly influenced by multiple factors: the impact velocity, the density of the honeycomb structure, and the distribution of wall thickness within the sub-honeycomb and the primary honeycomb matrix. Notably, the modular honeycomb with an optimally designed structure demonstrates superior high-speed impact resistance compared to conventional honeycombs of equivalent density. These insights underscore the potential for advanced honeycomb designs to further advance material performance in structural applications. © 2025 by the authors.","energy absorption; enhanced mechanical property; modular honeycomb; out-plane","Bearings (structural); Bulk Density; Sandwich structures; Density gradients; Energy; Enhanced mechanical property; Impact velocities; matrix; Mechanical; Modular honeycomb; Modulars; Out-plane; Property; Honeycomb structures","Hyon, Jinho, Extreme Energy Dissipation via Material Evolution in Carbon Nanotube Mats, Advanced Science, 8, 6, (2021); Mueller, Jochen, Energy Absorption Properties of Periodic and Stochastic 3D Lattice Materials, Advanced Theory and Simulations, 2, 10, (2019); Shen, Lumin, Negative Poisson's ratio and effective Young's modulus of a vertex-based hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb structure, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 206, (2021); Mirhakimi, Anooshe Sadat, Laser powder bed fusion of bio-inspired metamaterials for energy absorption applications: A review, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 31, pp. 2126-2155, (2024); Ha, Ngoc-san, Efficient energy absorption of bio-inspired bi-directional gradient hierarchical multi-cell structure, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 278, (2024); Shen, Lumin, Elastic properties of an additive manufactured three-dimensional vertex-based hierarchical re-entrant structure, Materials and Design, 216, (2022); Greco, Lucrezia, Design and Analysis of Energy Absorbent Bioinspired Lattice Structures, Journal of Bionic Engineering, 20, 4, pp. 1670-1686, (2023); Li, Lingbo, A novel hybrid lattice design of nested cell topology with enhanced energy absorption capability, Aerospace Science and Technology, 128, (2022); Mohammadi, Hossein, An insight from nature: Honeycomb pattern in advanced structural design for impact energy absorption, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 22, pp. 2862-2887, (2023); Farooq, Umar, Interfacial Mechanical Performance of Composite Honeycomb Sandwich Panels for Aerospace Applications, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 42, 5, pp. 1775-1782, (2017)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

During aircraft operation, the structure is subjected to impact loads that generate vibrations, and excessive amplitude may lead to structural fatigue failure. In the present work, piezoelectric actuators and sensors were utilized to implement active vibration control of the Miura-ori sandwich beam (MSB). First, the motion equation of the MSB was derived based on Hamilton’s principle and the assumed mode method, leading to the determination of its natural frequency. The shear deformation mechanism of the Miura-ori unit cell was then analyzed, and a new formula for calculating the equivalent transverse shear modulus is proposed. Further, the structure’s vibration was actively controlled using a velocity feedback control algorithm, and the effectiveness of the vibration control along with the required voltage for the actuator is evaluated from both time and frequency domain perspectives. Additionally, a newly developed finite element method was proposed for the purpose of confirming the effectiveness of the vibration control. The results demonstrate a strong alignment between the simulated natural frequencies and the theoretical predictions, confirming that the velocity feedback control algorithm effectively reduces excessive vibration amplitudes. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TE leg fabrication still relies on traditional methods with regular solid shapes which limits the conversion efficiency. In the present work, different geometries (solid, mesh, hollow, and honeycomb) based on a double-half-Heusler (hH) (Ti<inf>1.75</inf>Zr<inf>0.25</inf>Ni<inf>1.5</inf>Fe<inf>0.5</inf>SnSb) high-entropy alloy are 3D printed using direct ink writing technique. Through the rheological properties, good shear-thinning characteristics and excellent printability are shown. X-ray diffraction of the as-cast and sintered 3D-printed structures confirms the formation of dominant hH phase. Using infrared imaging, it is revealed that the heat distribution in these structures decreases as an order of as-cast, solid, mesh, hollow, and honeycomb geometries due to improved surface area to volume ratio respectively. Using X-ray micro-computed tomography, the total porosity of the 3D-printed sample is shown to be around 24.89%. Honeycomb-shaped structure shows highest temperature gradient (from top to bottom region of sample) of 174 °C as compared to as cast (60.1 °C), which is further validated using finite-element analysis.

Finite element models of the honeycomb are developed using Abaqus/Explicit and validated through quasistatic experiments for accuracy. Based on the models, a series of studies on the honeycomb's structural behavior are conducted. Initially, the mechanical properties of the honeycomb under varying loading conditions and rib angles are analyzed. The results indicate that the RSH-45 configuration exhibits the most favorable mechanical properties under both X-direction and Y-direction loading conditions. Specifically, under impact in the X-direction, the RSH-45 and RSH-60 configurations demonstrate increases in energy absorption of 114.64% and 96.9%, respectively, compared to the RSH-90 configuration. Subsequently, the mechanical properties of the RSH at different impact velocities are examined. The negative Poisson's effect of the RSH is most pronounced at low-velocity, with the deformation modes changing as velocity increases. Under medium-velocity impacts, RSH-45 and RSH-60 configurations exhibit a significant negative Poisson's ratio effect, while RSH-75 and RSH-90 configurations display a positive effect. In summary, reinforcing ribs produces a significant negative Poisson's ratio effect only at specific angles. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","energy absorption; mechanical properties; negative Poisson's ratios; rotating rigid honeycombs","ABAQUS; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; ABAQUS EXPLICIT; Energy; Finite element modelling (FEM); Loading condition; Mechanical; Negative Poisson ratio; Property; Quasi-static experiments; Rotating rigid honeycomb; Structural behaviors; Poisson ratio","Huang, Wenzhen, Crushing resistance tailoring of honeycomb material via vertex-derivative strategy, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Li, Ruoxu, Bio-inspired honeycomb structures to improve the crashworthiness of a battery-pack system, Engineering Failure Analysis, 158, (2024); Wang, Guangxiang, In-plane mechanical behavior design of novel re-entrant and hexagonal combined honeycombs, Materials Today Communications, 40, (2024); Zhao, Xuan, Bending response and energy absorption of sandwich beams with novel auxetic honeycomb core, Engineering Structures, 247, (2021); Zhou, Junxian, Energy absorption properties of multi-cell thin-walled tubes with a double surface gradient, Thin-Walled Structures, 145, (2019); Hu, Dayong, Energy-absorption characteristics of a bionic honeycomb tubular nested structure inspired by bamboo under axial crushing, Composites Part B: Engineering, 162, pp. 21-32, (2019); J Sandwich Struct Mater, (2024); Deng, Xiaolin, In-plane energy absorption characteristics and mechanical properties of novel re-entrant honeycombs, Composite Structures, 313, (2023); Fu, Minghui, A novel category of 3D chiral material with negative Poisson's ratio, Composites Science and Technology, 160, pp. 111-118, (2018); Alderson, Andrew, Elastic constants of 3-, 4- and 6-connected chiral and anti-chiral honeycombs subject to uniaxial in-plane loading, Composites Science and Technology, 70, 7, pp. 1042-1048, (2010)",""

Structural electromagnetic wave (EW) absorbing composites play a key role in both civil and military applications. However, the laminated plate structure and laminated honeycomb structure EW-absorbing composites were prone to delamination and low EW absorbing performance. To enhance the EW absorption and mechanical properties of composite materials, this study successfully developed a novel three-dimensional hexagonal honeycomb woven composites (3D-HHWC). 3D-HHWC with a three-dimensional hexagonal honeycomb woven fabric (3D-HHWF) as the reinforced materials was manufactured by the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process with epoxy resin, carbon black (CB), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and carbonyl iron powder (CIP) as functional materials. The EW absorption performance and bending mechanical properties of 3D-HHWC with different structural parameters were compared and analyzed. The test results demonstrated that the 3D-HHWC (H<inf>2-3</inf>) achieved a remarkable minimum reflection loss of −38.1 dB with the effective electromagnetic absorption band (EAB) 13.8 GHz. Additionally, CST provided a clear explanation of the electromagnetic field distribution elucidating the mechanism for EW absorption. While the 3D-HHWC (H<inf>2-3</inf>) had a maximum bending load 6603.9 N without obvious delamination phenomenon. Furthermore, finite element simulation clarified internal stress distribution explaining the failure mechanisms. In conclusion, the 3D-HHWC exhibited outstanding EW absorption and mechanical properties for widespread application in military and aerospace fields. Highlights: The 3D-HHWC was formed by VARTM process with epoxy resin, CB, MWCNTs, and CIP. The 3D-HHWC had excellent EM performance with RL<inf>min</inf> −38.1 dB and EAB 13.8 GHz. CST provided a clear explanation of the electromagnetic field distribution. The 3D-HHWC had a maximum bending load 6603.9 N without obvious delamination.

This unique approach effectively combines the shear thickening behavior of MRP with the magnetically sensitive characteristic of magnetorheological materials, resulting in a flexible structure that demonstrates tunable energy absorption performance. Rheological analysis reveals that both MRE and MRP exhibit outstanding MR effect, achieving 127.48% and 1095.99%, respectively. MRP demonstrates a pronounced shear thickening effect, which is further enhanced with increasing magnetic flux density. Moreover, quasi-static compression tests demonstrate that increasing the compression rate and magnetic flux density favorably enhance the Young’s modulus and energy absorption of MSF structure. Among them, the energy absorption of MSF at a strain of 50% increased by 29.55%, and the Young’s modulus increased by 113.04% when the current was raised from 0 to 5 A. Finally, finite element analysis was conducted to verify the impact of shear thickening of MRP and the MR effect of MR materials on the stress distribution of MSF during compression and their contribution to energy absorption.

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb structures. However, most of the existing researches focus on the gradient design of traditional honeycomb structures, and the gradient design of new structures needs to be further studied. Compared with the traditional honeycomb, the sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure has better energy absorption capacity, compressive strength and bending strength, and also has excellent performance in sound insulation and shock absorption. Therefore, this paper takes the sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure as the research object. Materials and Methods: In order to further improve the dynamic response of honeycomb structures under in-plane impact, numerical simulation, experimental verification and multi-objective optimization design are adopted in this paper. Firstly, the sine curve is introduced into the negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure. The gradient layer number of the cellular structure was fixed, and the sinusoidal negative Poisson ratio cellular structure was established with the amplitude, period and cell wall thickness of the sinusoidal curve as the gradient. Under multivelocit conditions, the sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio cell structures of the non-gradient (NG-CM), amplitude gradient (AG-CM), periodic gradient (PG-CM), and wall thickness gradient (WTG-CM) was simulated and analyzed for comparison. Secondly, according to the theory of multicellular materials, a formula for calculating the relative density of honeycomb structures with negative Poisson's ratio of sinusoidal curves is established. The relationship between cell parameters, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio is derived by taking a single cell with sinusoidal negative Poisson's ratio as the analysis target. Thirdly, the NG-CM specimen was made by metal 3D printer and the quasi-static compression test was carried out. The test results were compared with the simulation results, and the reliability of the finite element simulation results was verified. Forthly, the number of gradient layers of the honeycomb structure is changed. AG-CM, PG-CM and WTG-CM with two gradient layers, four gradient layers and six gradient layers were established respectively, and their buffering energy absorption characteristics were simulated by ABAQUS under multi-velocity conditions. Finally, NSGA-II algorithm based on random forest is used to optimize the gradient sinusoidal honeycomb structure. The amplitude gradient value and wall thickness gradient value of the honeycomb structure are taken as design variables, and the PCF and SEA generated by the honeycomb structure in the face of impact are taken as optimization targets. In order to verify the accuracy of the optimization results, a simulation model was established and the impact simulation was carried out through the gradient values corresponding to the two groups of optimization values. The error between the optimization results and the simulation results was within 5%, which met the requirements of the optimization design. The innovation of this paper is that the AG-CM, PG-CM, WTG-CM honeycomb structure based on sine curve is proposed, and then the negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure is proposed with layer gradient. The research in this paper revealed the relationship between gradient setting, impact mode, gradient layer number, PCF and SEA of sinusoidal gradient negative Poisson’s ratio honeycomb structure, which provided a prerequisite for quantitative analysis when considering the specific application situation. It will provide a new design idea for the multi-objective optimization of the impact dynamic performance of honeycomb structures. Conclusion: The results show that WTG-CM has the lowest PCF and the highest specific absorption energy (SEA) under low velocity (7 m/s) impact. In the face of positive gradient impact (PGI) at medium and high speed (35 m/s, 70 m/s), the buffering and energy absorption characteristics of AG-CM are better than other honeycomb structures. WTG-CM has the lowest PCF and the highest SEA when facing the inverse gradient shock (NGI). The smaller the number of gradient layers, the more obvious the densification is. The honeycomb structure produces plastic deformation in regions with low relative density. The difference of compaction strain between gradient layers decreases with the increase of the number of gradient layers. According to the actual demand, two groups of optimization values are selected from a series of optimization solutions. The PCF of optimization value 1 is reduced by 64.9% compared with NG-CM, and the SEA of optimization value 2 is increased by 22.2% compared with NG-CM, showing obvious optimization effect. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Energy absorption; Functional gradient; Honeycomb structures; In-plane impact; Negative Poisson's ratio","","Int J Impact Eng, (2004); Bian, Yijie, Deformation mode and energy absorption of polycrystal-inspired square-cell lattice structures, Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (English Edition), 41, 10, pp. 1561-1582, (2020); Wang, Tao, A novel 3D impact energy absorption structure with negative Poisson's ratio and its application in aircraft crashworthiness, Composite Structures, 262, (2021); Zhang, Jianxun, Low-velocity impact of rectangular foam-filled fiber metal laminate tubes, Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (English Edition), 42, 12, pp. 1733-1742, (2021); Dalela, Srajan, A review on application of mechanical metamaterials for vibration control, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 22, pp. 3237-3262, (2022); Linforth, Steven, Investigation of the auxetic oval structure for energy absorption through quasi-static and dynamic experiments, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 147, (2021); Lu, Huan, In-plane dynamics crushing of a combined auxetic honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 160, (2021); Menon, Hrishikesh G., Proposed auxetic cluster designs for lightweight structural beams with improved load bearing capacity, Engineering Structures, 260, (2022); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic indentation of auxetic and non-auxetic honeycombs under large deformation, Composite Structures, 207, pp. 323-330, (2019); Jiang, Hongyong, Crashworthiness of novel concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio biologically inspired by coconut palm, Thin-Walled Structures, 154, (2020)",""

Finally, according to the impact on the overall structure caused by the dismantling of each initial failure component, the structural importance matrix and the component importance coefficient are proposed to describe the severity of the impact on the structure caused by the dismantling of each component. The results show that:The vibration mode distribution of the structure is mostly symmetrical, and the stiffness of the outer ring is stronger than that of the inner ring, and the vertical stiffness is weaker than the circumferential stiffness. The natural vibration frequency and vibration mode of the structure are sensitive to the load distribution and the horizontal projection radius coefficient of the lower chord node. Compared with other components, the broken removal of the ring component is more likely to cause uneven prestress distribution of the adjacent sub-structure, resulting in large area collapse of the whole structure, and then cause progressive collapse. In the parametric analysis, the initial prestress level and the vector-span ratio have different effects on the final failure pattern after the demolition of important structures, and the appropriate range of prestress and vector-span ratio is given. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers","Coefficient of importance; Fully articulated chord-supported dome; Natural vibration characteristic; Parameter analysis; Progressive collapse resistance","Demolition; Domes; Dynamic response; Electric load distribution; Honeycomb structures; Intelligent buildings; Poles; Pressure vessels; Rings (components); Vibration analysis; Coefficient of importance; Collapse resistance; Dome structure; Fully articulated chord-supported dome; Large openings; Natural vibration characteristic; Parameter analysis; Progressive collapse; Progressive collapse resistance; Vibration modes; Stiffness","J Build Struct, (2010); J Build Struct, (2020); Jiang, Zhengrong, Analysis of imperfection sensitive region of long-span elliptic paraboloid suspended dome structure, Huanan Ligong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science), 44, 12, pp. 112-119, (2016); Zhang, Ming, Failure criterion for suspen-domes based on exponential strain energy density, Zhendong yu Chongji/Journal of Vibration and Shock, 37, 11, pp. 145-152, (2018); J Tianjin Univ Nat Sci Eng Technol, (2017); Wei, Jianpeng, Parameter Analysis of Progressive Collapse Simulation of Long-Span Spatial Grid Structures, International Journal of Steel Structures, 19, 6, pp. 1718-1731, (2019); Ind Build, (2016); J Build Struct, (2013); Nat Sci Eng Technol, (2017); J Archit, (2019)",""

In this paper, the compressive characteristics of chiral four-ligament auxetic (CFA), re-entrant auxetic (REA), and conventional hexagon (CHH) cellular structures under out-of-plane conditions are compared through experimental, finite element, and theoretical analyses. The deformation patterns, force-displacement curves, and crashworthiness are contrasted. By comparing the axial quasi-static compression experiments with the simulation outcomes, the accuracy of the finite element model is verified. It is revealed that the specific energy absorption (SEA) and mean crushing force (MCF) of CFA are significantly higher than those of CHH and REA. Subsequently, in line with the engineering application scenarios, the compression performances of three types of cellular structures under various impact velocities, relative densities, and impact angles are explored. The results suggest that except for the situation where the SEA and MCF of CHH and CFA are close under the quasi-static compression with the same relative density, the crashworthiness indices of CFA are superior to those of CHH and REA under other loading conditions. Additionally, based on the theoretical model of the super-folding simplified unit, the energy absorption (EA) and MCF of the three honeycomb structures were analyzed.

These structures exhibit similar elastic modulus to natural materials and superior specific energy absorption. The Diamond exhibits superior compressive resistance and bending toughness under both quasi-static compression and three-point bending tests.

The novelty and distinction of this research lie in its broad investigation of the influence of various slab thicknesses, types, and damping ratios on failure analysis in a total of 54 scenarios, considering two engineering methods, six slab models, three thicknesses, and three damping ratios. A five-span five-bay RC structure model was analyzed using SAP2000 and ELS programs. A three-stage column removal was performed, with 3-second intervals to allow for sufficient vibration damping. In order to observe behavioral changes not only one corner column, but also with the columns that follow those adjacent to it on both sides were removed. The displacement values of the corner column were then compared in both cases. While AEM, for each slab piece, used cuboid-shaped elements connected by springs, applying a “thin structure correction factor” to consider shear and flexure behavior, FEM analyzed five slab types. AEM elements connected by springs, whereas FEM employs linear elements and the distributed plasticity concept (fiber hinges). The findings reveal that AEM exhibits higher rigidity and damping within the first second, contrasting with FEM's 2–2.50 seconds. The layered-shell slab model, characterized by its comprehensiveness and realism, exhibits more rigid behavior. Therefore, AEM model, particularly when considering the thickest layered-shell slab structure, relatively aligns with the FEM model. Increasing the slab thickness has a greater impact on the rigidity of the FEM model, thereby enhancing its resilience. Conversely, in the AEM-based solid model, an increase in slab weight (thickness) results in more displacement. A validation study was conducted by comparing the results with a former experimental test. Overall, the study highlights the viability of both methods for PC analysis, as long as their characteristics are well-understood. The AEM serves as an alternative to FEM, particularly in scenarios involving multiple element removals, considering computational time and modeling practicality. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers","Applied element method (AEM); Extreme loading for structures (ELS); Finite element method (FEM); Shell-plate elements; Solid mechanics","Columns (structural); Compressive stress; Cracks; Dynamic response; Hinges; Honeycomb structures; Hydraulic structures; Plates (structural components); Pressure vessels; Rigid structures; Shells (structures); Steel beams and girders; Stress concentration; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Applied element method; Element method; Extreme loading for structure; Extreme loadings; Finite element method; Plate elements; Shell plates; Shell-plate element; Solid mechanics; Rigidity","undefined, (2007); Lu, Jinxian, Progressive collapse of Murrah Federal Building: Revisited, Journal of Building Engineering, 57, (2022); undefined, (2005); Public Rev Draft, (2012); Bredean, Lucian A., The influence of beams design and the slabs effect on the progressive collapse resisting mechanisms development for RC framed structures, Engineering Failure Analysis, 91, pp. 527-542, (2018); Steer Eeri 2023 Mw 7 8 Kahramanmaras Turkiye Earthquake Sequence Joint Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report Pvrr, (2023); undefined, (2023); Concrete Structures Under Blast Loading Dynamic Response Damage and Residual Strength Resilience of Cities to Terrorist and Other Threats, (2008); Singh, Harmanpreet, A contemporary review on progressive collapse, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 1326, 1, (2024); Thai, Huu Tai, A review on modular construction for high-rise buildings, Structures, 28, pp. 1265-1290, (2020)",""

Two single-span, two-story models at a 1:2 scale were designed and tested under low reverse cyclic loading using horizontal actuators to apply a cyclic load history. The only variable distinguishing the two specimens was the presence or absence of a sandwich-insulated wall. The deformation and failure patterns of the specimens were observed, and seismic performance parameters such as hysteresis loops, skeleton curves, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity were analyzed. The experimental results indicated that the CFT-truss column frame exhibits excellent seismic performance, with its ductility meeting the elastic-plastic inter-story drift limits required for seismic design. Furthermore, the CFT-truss column frame with insulated wall panels exhibited a 19.7 % higher load-bearing capacity and 1.6 times greater yield stiffness by preventing local buckling of the columns, while maintaining minimal impact on the energy dissipation capacity of the specimens. Finite element (FE) models were developed and validated against the experimental results. The FE analysis in stress maps indicated that damage is primarily concentrated in the web members, resulting in little impact of changes in strength and dimensions on seismic performance of other components. Specifically, the load-bearing capacity and yield stiffness are positively correlated with the steel tube strength, the beam-to-column stiffness ratio, and the thickness of the concrete panels. In contrast, the concrete slab strength has a minor impact. Additionally, as the axial compression ratio increases, both the peak bearing capacity and ductility initially increase and then decrease. © 2024","CFT-truss column frame; Experimental study; Numerical parametric analyses; Sandwich-insulated wall; Seismic behavior","Axial compression; Columns (structural); Concrete beams and girders; Concrete buildings; Concrete slabs; Convergence of numerical methods; Cyclic loads; Earthquake effects; Energy dissipators; Honeycomb structures; Mortar; Sandwich structures; Seismic design; Seismic response; Tall buildings; Tubular steel structures; Walls (structural partitions); Concrete filled steel tube truss; Concrete-filled steel tube truss column frame; Experimental study; Insulated walls; Load-bearing capacity; Numerical parametric analyze; Parametric analysis; Sandwich-insulated wall; Seismic behaviour; Seismic Performance; Trusses","Du, Yansheng, Seismic behaviors of CFT-column frame-four-corner bolted connected buckling-restrained steel plate shear walls using ALC/RAC panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 195, (2024); Alatshan, Faesal, Stiffened concrete-filled steel tubes: A systematic review, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); Du, Yansheng, Eccentric compression behaviors of iron tailings and recycled aggregate concrete-filled steel tube columns, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 223, (2024); Huang, Wei, Experimental and numerical study on the compressive behavior of micro-expansive ultra-high-performance concrete-filled steel tube columns, Construction and Building Materials, 254, (2020); Wang, Yingtao, Hysteretic behavior of square CFT columns with binding bars, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 131, pp. 162-175, (2017); Gao, Dinghui, Behavior of CFRP confined rectangular high-strength concrete-filled steel tubular columns under eccentric compression, Engineering Structures, 321, (2024); Wang, Yuhang, Experimental Study on Torsion Behavior of Concrete Filled Steel Tube Columns subjected to Eccentric Compression, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 129, pp. 119-128, (2017); Yang, Di, Energy path of circular concrete-filled steel tube stub columns under axial compression, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 213, (2024); Chen, Zhihua, Experiment of axial compression bearing capacity for crisscross section special-shaped column composed of concrete-filled square steel tubes, Tianjin Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue yu Gongcheng Jishu Ban)/Journal of Tianjin University Science and Technology, 39, 11, pp. 1275-1282, (2006); Steel Construction, (2006)",""

Porous lattice structures with auxetic properties are widely prevalent in the field of energy absorption due to their lightweight nature and contraction behavior when subjected to compression. Based on previous research on planar metamaterials, both planar honeycombs and three-dimensional metamaterial lattices are constructed for energy absorption purposes. Four honeycomb samples made from a single material were subjected to compression tests to verify the accuracy of numerical finite element models. The numerical results indicate that the negative thermal expansion effect can mitigate the increasing rate of initial compression load, while conventional positive thermal expansion inevitably leads to a sudden surge in initial thermal load. However, the negative thermal expansion behavior associated with small deformations has minimal impact on energy absorption capacity involving large deformations. Moreover, these four metamaterials possess high effective elastic modulus and strength, along with low quasi-isotropic thermal expansion and Poisson's ratio. One type of planar or three-dimensional metamaterial displays higher energy absorption capacity due to its high plateau stress and stable compression process resulting from auxeticity. Their high specific energy absorption effectively characterizes them as buffer devices capable of protecting personnel and precision equipment from impacts. © 2024","Energy absorption; Honeycombs; Mechanical metamaterials; Negative Poisson's ratio; Negative thermal expansion; Three–dimensional lattice","Compression testing; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Three dimensional displays; Auxetics; Energy; Energy absorption capacity; High-energy absorption; Honeycomb; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Negative Poisson ratio; Thermal; Three-dimensional lattices; Negative thermal expansion","Jiao, Pengcheng, Mechanical metamaterials and beyond, Nature Communications, 14, 1, (2023); Nicolaou, Zachary G., Mechanical metamaterials with negative compressibility transitions, Nature Materials, 11, 7, pp. 608-613, (2012); Kumar Saxena, Krishna Kumar, Three Decades of Auxetics Research − Materials with Negative Poisson's Ratio: A Review, Advanced Engineering Materials, 18, 11, pp. 1847-1870, (2016); He, Peng, Lightweight 3D Graphene Metamaterials with Tunable Negative Thermal Expansion, Advanced Materials, 35, 6, (2023); Zhang, Qiao, A series of auxetic metamaterials with negative thermal expansion based on L-shaped microstructures, Thin-Walled Structures, 197, (2024); Ma, Nanfang, Hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb metamaterial for energy absorption and vibration insulation, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 250, (2023); Zhang, Qiao, Low frequency bandgap and high stiffness of innovative auxetic metamaterial with negative thermal expansion, Thin-Walled Structures, 201, (2024); Zhou, Sicong, Deformation behaviors and energy absorption characteristics of a hollow re-entrant auxetic lattice metamaterial, Aerospace Science and Technology, 142, (2023); Zhang, Qiao, Superior energy absorption characteristics of additively-manufactured hollow-walled lattices, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 264, (2024); Yang, Yan, Energy absorption characteristics of a super hexagonal honeycomb under out-of-plane crushing, Thin-Walled Structures, 189, (2023)",""

In this study, rib-reinforced gradient honeycomb structures, including wall-ribbed reinforced gradient honeycomb (WRRGH) and vertex-ribbed reinforced gradient honeycomb (VRRGH), were designed by incorporating ribs into regular hexagonal honeycombs. The in-plane mechanical properties and energy absorption capacity of these two structures, along with a uniform hexagonal honeycomb (UHH), were investigated through quasi-static compression tests (10⁻³ s⁻¹), drop hammer impact tests (220 s⁻¹), Kolsky bar tests (1500 s⁻¹), and finite element simulations.

Under all three loading conditions, WRRGH and VRRGH significantly outperform UHH in terms of specific energy absorption (SEA). Specifically, SEA improvements for WRRGH and VRRGH under quasi-static loading are 64.5 % and 212.4 %, respectively; under drop-weight impact, SEA increases by 78.9 % and 77.9 %; and under Kolsky bar dynamic loading, the enhancements are 227.6 % and 32.79 %, respectively. Additionally, shear failure in the gradient structures becomes more pronounced at higher strain rates, indicating a strain rate-dependent failure mechanism.

Metallic foams are exceptionally appropriate for spacecraft debris shields owing to their light weight and superior energy absorption characteristics. The internal mesostructure of a metallic foam plays a crucial role in determining its protective performance. At the mesoscale, the density gradient metallic foam exhibits a greater potential for protection compared to uniform metallic foam under hypervelocity impact. Therefore, this study investigates the behavior of density-gradient foams under hypervelocity impact. By leveraging three-dimensional Voronoi tessellation in conjunction with the background mesh-mapping algorithm, this study constructed mesoscopic finite element models of the layered and continuous-density gradient metallic foam, considering the internal structure of randomness. Subsequently, the Finite Element-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (FE-SPH) adaptive method in LS-DYNA was employed to conduct numerical simulations of the hypervelocity impact. First, the simulation was validated through a comparison with the experiment. Based on the results of the numerical simulations, the characteristics of the debris cloud and the damage within the foam were analyzed. It was determined that the protection mechanism of the density gradient foam sandwich panel under hypervelocity impact involved a coupling effect between the domino and microchannel effects. The different damage characteristics of layered density gradient foam sandwich panels were analyzed. According to this mechanism, foam sandwich panels with different density-gradient configurations were designed and their protective performances were compared to determine the optimal density-gradient configuration to provide valuable insights into the optimal design of protective structures. © 2024","Debris clouds; Density gradient foam sandwich panels; Hypervelocity impact; Mesoscopic model of metallic foam","Error correction; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Debris cloud; Density gradient foam sandwich panel; Density gradients; Foam sandwiches; Hypervelocity impacts; Mesoscopic model of metallic foam; Mesoscopic modeling; Metallic foam; Protective performance; Sandwich panel; Metal foams","Fair, Harry, Hypervelocity then and now, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 5, 1-4, pp. 1-11, (1987); undefined, (2004); Astronomical Journal, (1947); Chen, Ying, Review on hypervelocity impact of advanced space debris protection shields, Thin-Walled Structures, 200, (2024); Cour-Palais, Burton G., A multi-shock concept for spacecraft shielding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 10, 1-4, pp. 135-146, (1990); Christiansen, Eric L., Mesh double-bumper shield: A low-weight alternative for spacecraft meteoroid and orbital debris protection, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 14, 1-4, pp. 169-180, (1993); Christiansen, Eric L., Enhanced meteoroid and orbital debris shielding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 17, 1-3, pp. 217-228, (1995); Ryan, Shannon J., Hypervelocity impact testing of advanced materials and structures for micrometeoroid and orbital debris shielding, Acta Astronautica, 83, pp. 216-231, (2013); Destefanis, Roberto, Enhanced space debris shields for manned spacecraft, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 29, 1-10, pp. 215-226, (2003); undefined, (2015)",""

In traditional Whipple shield designs, the area between the front bumper and rear pressure wall, termed the stand-off distance, is left empty. One of the more recent discussions in shield design has been the utilization of a honeycomb sandwich core design. In this design an initial thin bumper plate is used to fragment the projectile, followed by a honeycomb design which is implemented to further slowdown the resulting fragments in the stand-off region. By using this implementation, the rear pressure wall is theoretically subject to less damage as a result of the impact, due to the addition of the honeycomb core. It is often argued that the addition of a honeycomb core within the Whipple shield induces a channeling behavior of the projectile, where the sharp edges of the honeycomb split the projectile, and the fragments generated are unable to escape the individual honeycomb core that it is propelled into. It is theorized that this channeling effect causes more damage than an impact where no honeycomb is present. This channeling effect induces a large amount of the mass of the projectile to impact the backplate over a much smaller area. As a result, the damage to the backplate is far more localized and of a higher intensity. In this paper the efficacy of this theory has been studied through an analytical approach, where Whipple shields with the honeycomb and standard 2-plate designs are subjected to hypervelocity impacts of orbital debris. © 2024","Finite element analysis; Honeycomb structure; Hypervelocity impact physics; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Whipple shield","Accelerator shielding; Honeycomb structures; Orbits; Structural analysis; Tropics; Vortex flow; A: Honeycomb; Finite element analyse; Honeycomb core; Hypervelocity impact physic; Hypervelocity impacts; Impact physics; Orbital debris; Shield design; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Whipple shield; Projectiles","undefined, (2022); Thurber, Andrew, On the fluidic response of structures in hypervelocity impacts, Journal of Fluids Engineering, 137, 4, (2015); J Geophys Res, (1987); Choudhary, Shashank, Ballistic impact behaviour of newly developed armour grade steel: An experimental and numerical study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 140, (2020); Piekutowski, Andrew J., Characteristics of debris clouds produced by hypervelocity impact of aluminum spheres with thin aluminum plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 14, 1-4, pp. 573-586, (1993); Christiansen, Eric L., Enhanced meteoroid and orbital debris shielding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 17, 1-3, pp. 217-228, (1995); Anderson, Charles E., Debris cloud dynamics, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 9, 1, pp. 89-113, (1990); Carriere, Riley, Hypervelocity Impacts on Satellite Sandwich Structures—A Review of Experimental Findings and Predictive Models, Applied Mechanics, 2, 1, pp. 25-45, (2021); Liou, Jer Chyi, Collision activities in the future orbital debris environment, Advances in Space Research, 38, 9, pp. 2102-2106, (2006); Meyers, Marc Andreé, Dynamic Behavior Of Materials, pp. 1-668, (2007)",""

The nonlinear hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviors of TPU foam were simulated using the compressible Hyperfoam model with Rayleigh damping, and the accuracy of the finite element model was verified by falling ball impact tests. By comparing with pure foam structure (PFS) and traditional sandwich structure (TSS), the BPAS showed more uniform and moderate stress distribution, transfer, and deformation under impact demonstrating a special bidirectional protection property, which is attributed to the energy dispersion of its upper foam, lateral stress redistribution, and energy dissipation effects of its rigid core.

Considering a power law distribution, the mechanical and electrical material characteristics of the FGM and FGPM layers change continually along the thickness plane. The finite element method (FEM) and the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) are utilized in the modeling process for the FGM and FGPM layers. In the dynamic analysis, the dynamic response of the sandwich structure under the impact of sinusoidally distributed step load and the corresponding sensor voltage is obtained. To ensure that the simulations are accurate, the findings are compared with previously published research. To analyze the control efficiency of FGPM sensors and actuators on the FGM host structure, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is utilized. The sandwich structure is considered a multiple-input multiple-output system (MIMO), so sensors and actuators are placed at different locations on the plate surface. The modal strain energy method is utilized to find the appropriate location of the FGPM layers. According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that piezoelectric material coefficients as well as mechanical properties are extremely important for obtaining optimum control performance from FGPM sensors and actuators. In addition, it is emphasized that active vibration control of FGM plates can be performed effectively with the proper selection of sensors and actuators and their accurate distribution on the plate. These results are expected to contribute to micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensor and actuator applications, soft robotics applications, and vibration protection and vibration damping applications of nanostructures. © 2025 The Author(s).

The parameter N symbolizes the count of circular arcs present on each cell wall, leading to the establishment of six distinct models representing the circular arc-wave honeycomb structure. The deformation behaviors of each model subjected to impacts from both directions in in-plane was meticulously investigated using LS-DYNA software. The load-displacement curves were formulated to illustrate and analyze the structural responses. The impact of the number N of circular arcs on the structural crashworthiness was comprehensively discussed, and comparative analyses were carried out with the traditional hexagonal honeycomb structure, focusing on three key metrics: peak crushing force (PCF), specific energy absorption (SEA), and crush force efficiency (CFE). Finite element simulations revealed that the circular arc-wave honeycomb structure demonstrates superior crashworthiness compared to the traditional hexagonal honeycomb structure. Specifically, when N = 2, the circular arc-wave honeycomb exhibits an 83.08% maximal reduction in PCF, maximal enhancement of 63.19% in SEA, and an unprecedented improvement of 1196.97% in CFE, the maximum attained CFE stands at 92.59%. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","circular arc-wave honeycomb; crashworthiness; crush force efficiency; peak crushing force; specific energy absorption","Accidents; Crashworthiness; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Cell walls; Circular arc; Circular arc-wave honeycomb; Crush force efficiency; Deformation behavior; Hexagonal honeycomb; LS-DYNA; Peak crushing force; Simulation and analysis; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Woodhead Publishing Limited, (2003); Structural Impact, (1989); Liu, Jie, On sound insulation of pyramidal lattice sandwich structure, Composite Structures, 208, pp. 385-394, (2019); Wu, Fei, Mechanical properties and energy absorption of composite bio-inspired multi-cell tubes, Thin-Walled Structures, 184, (2023); Yin, Hanfeng, Optimization design of a novel hybrid hierarchical cellular structure for crashworthiness, Composite Structures, 303, (2023); Wang, Yuan, Crashworthiness design of functional gradient bionic structures under axial impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 192, (2023); Wang, Hui, On crashworthiness of novel porous structure based on composite TPMS structures, Engineering Structures, 252, (2022); Gao, Qiang, Multi-objective crashworthiness optimization for an auxetic cylindrical structure under axial impact loading, Materials and Design, 143, pp. 120-130, (2018); Zhou, Pengheng, Prediction of microwave absorption behavior of grading honeycomb composites based on effective permittivity formulas, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 63, 8, pp. 3496-3501, (2015); Li, Hao, Broadband low-frequency vibration attenuation in 3D printed composite meta-lattice sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 215, (2021)",""

In order to meet the requirements of the fourth generation of synchrotron light sources, researchers have designed a DCM using an active control method to ensure stability by actively compensating for crystal displacement through voice coil motors. The active control method imposes high demands on the vibration isolation performance of the DCM frame. In response to external excitation characteristics, this paper proposes a quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) isolation system based on a compressed buckling beam structure. Random vibration simulations using finite element analysis revealed that, under different operating conditions, the 3σ displacement of the core part of the DCM is maintained at the nanometer level. Moreover, this paper presents a calculation method based on elastic potential energy to establish force equilibrium equations for negative stiffness and analyzes stress distribution in the beam during vibration using the derived deflection curve. Validation through finite element simulations confirms the method’s accuracy in calculating negative stiffness and stress distribution.

Low velocity impact simulations were performed in LS DYNA finite element program to investigate the effects of core configuration and curve angle on peak contact force, energy absorption efficiency and damage mode. A progressive damage analysis based on the combination of the Hashin damage criterion and the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) with bilinear traction-separation law was performed using the MAT-54 (ENHANCED_COMPOSITE_DAMAGE) material model. Among the five different cores, Trapezoidal core has the highest peak force average of 2.9 kN while Triangular core sandwich structure has the lowest with 1.23 kN. Absorbed energy efficiency average was highest for rectangular core with 0.95 and lowest for sinusoidal core with 0.69. The specific absorbed energy value was highest for Triangular core with 0.312 J/g and lowest for Sinusoidal core with 0.178 J/g. The damage area on the structure increased with increasing curve angle. It was determined that the core structure and curve angle is an effective parameter on peak force and energy absorption efficiency. Highlights: Impact behavior of sandwich composite structures was examined. The effects of core type and curve angles on peak force, energy absorption efficiency and specific absorption energy were investigated.

A specific folding pattern was applied to the honeycomb to create the origami-based re-entrant honeycomb (ORH), aimed at improving the energy absorption properties of the sandwich structure. The study on the energy absorption properties of structures under low-velocity impact (LVI) utilized both experimental and numerical approaches. The energy absorption properties of the sandwich structure were examined by conducting LVI tests with different impact energy and then compared to the mechanical properties of the traditional re-entrant honeycomb sandwich structures (TRHSS). Additionally, a refined finite element model has been established and its accuracy verified. Numerical studies were conducted to explore the effects of structural parameters on the energy absorption properties of ORH sandwich structure (ORHSS). The results show that the ORHSS exhibited a significant reduction in peak force when subjected to LVI, in contrast to the TRHSS. Furthermore, the ORHSS exhibit significant efficiency in energy absorption. Enhancing the wall thickness (Formula presented.) or folding angle (Formula presented.) can significantly improve the energy absorption properties of the ORHSS, thereby boosting the honeycomb's contribution to this process. This optimization results in an improved absorptive effect of the structure. The findings offer new recommendations for developing lightweight absorbent materials with potential applications across various industries. Highlights: A novel composite sandwich structure serves as an efficient device for absorbing energy. This sandwich structure exhibits excellent cushioning and energy absorption capabilities. Changing geometric parameters can enhance the impact performance of the structure. A larger folding angle (Formula presented.) makes the core more prone to deformation. The greater the forward length (Formula presented.) of the ORH, the lower specific energy absorption (SEA) of the ORHSS. © 2024 Society of Plastics Engineers.","composites; finite element analysis (FEA); low-velocity impact; sandwich panel","Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; A: Honeycomb; Energy absorption properties; Experimental approaches; Finite element analyse; Finite element analyze; Folding patterns; Foldings; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Low velocity impact; Sandwich panel; Sandwich structures","Wang, Meng, Quasi-static three-point bending of sandwich panels with Miura-ori cores, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 268, (2024); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Acanfora, Valerio, Experimental investigation on 3D printed lightweight sandwich structures for energy absorption aerospace applications, Aerospace Science and Technology, 137, (2023); Zhang, Chao, Damage in hybrid corrugated core sandwich structures under high velocity hail ice impact: A numerical study, Defence Technology, 27, pp. 217-236, (2023); Zhang, Wei, Deformation and failure of hybrid composite sandwich beams with a metal foam core under quasi-static load and low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 242, (2020); Langdon, Genevieve S., The response of honeycomb core sandwich panels, with aluminum and composite face sheets, to blast loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 12, 6, pp. 733-754, (2010); Guo, Haoyuan, Review of sandwich structures under impact loadings: Experimental, numerical and theoretical analysis, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024); Lv, Hangyu, Low-velocity impact response of composite sandwich structure with grid–honeycomb hybrid core, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 246, (2023); Xue, Xinwei, Study on the impact resistance of honeycomb sandwich structures under low-velocity/heavy mass, Composite Structures, 226, (2019); Duan, Yuechen, Mechanical characteristics of composite honeycomb sandwich structures under oblique impact, Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters, 12, 5, (2022)",""

Algorithms based on machine learning (ML) models are capable of discerning intricate structural behavioral patterns from real-time data gathered by sensors, thereby offering solutions to engineering quandaries in structural mechanics and SHM. This study presents an innovative approach based on AI and a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) double-helix sensor system for the prediction of forces acting on steel tube members in offshore wind turbine support systems; this enables structural health monitoring of the support system. The steel tube as the transitional member and the FRP double helix-sensor system were initially modeled in three dimensions using ABAQUS finite element software. Subsequently, the data obtained from the finite element analysis (FEA) were inputted into a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model, with the objective of establishing a nonlinear mapping relationship between the inputs (strain) and the outputs (reaction force). In the FCNN model, the impact of the number of input variables on the model’s predictive performance is examined through cross-comparison of different combinations and positions of the six sets of input variables. And based on an evaluation of engineering costs and the number of strain sensors, a series of potential combinations of variables are identified for further optimization. Furthermore, the potential variable combinations were optimized using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, resulting in optimal input variable combinations that achieved the accuracy level of more input variable combinations with fewer sensors. This not only improves the prediction performance of the model but also effectively controls the engineering cost. The model performance was evaluated using several metrics, including R2, MSE, MAE, and SMAPE. The results demonstrated that the CNN model exhibited notable advantages in terms of fitting accuracy and computational efficiency when confronted with a limited data set. To provide further support for practical applications, an interactive graphical user interface (GUI)-based sensor-coupled mechanical prediction system for steel tubes was developed. This system enables engineers to predict the member forces of steel tubes in real time, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of SHM for offshore wind turbine support systems. © 2025 by the authors.","ABAQUS; AI; CNN; FCNN; FRP double-helix sensor system; GUI; member forces; offshore wind turbine support systems; SHM; steel tubes","ABAQUS; Aluminum bridges; Arches; Automatic testing; Carbon phenolic composites; Convolutional neural networks; Cost engineering; Electric towers; Embankments; Energy dissipators; Erosion; Error compensation; Error correction; Error detection; Foundations; Gamification; Honeycomb structures; Hydraulic structures; Instrument errors; ISO Standards; Light weight structures; Low temperature testing; Nondestructive examination; Offshore wind turbines; Pressure vessels; Quality function deployment; Retaining walls; Rigid structures; Safety factor; Temperature scales; Tubes (components); Tubular steel structures; Tubular turbines; Water towers; Convolutional neural network; Double helix; Fiber-reinforced polymer double-helix sensor system; Fiber-reinforced polymers; Fibre reinforced polymers; Fully connected neural network; Health monitoring; Member forces; Offshore wind turbine support system; Offshore winds; Sensor systems; Steel tube; Structural health; Support systems; Graphical user interfaces; polymer; steel; adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; benchmarking; cloud computing; computer interface; controlled study; convolutional neural network; finite element analysis; force; human; Internet; machine learning; mean squared error; mechanics; nerve cell network; prediction; sensor; software; tube; velocity; wind","Ren, Wei, Compressive behavior of stiffened steel tubes for wind turbine towers, Thin-Walled Structures, 183, (2023); Haselibozchaloee, Danial, A review of fatigue damage assessment in offshore wind turbine support structure, International Journal of Fatigue, 164, (2022); Varelis, George E., Structural behavior and design of high-strength steel welded tubular connections under extreme loading, Marine Structures, 71, (2020); Wang, Lin, Reliability of offshore wind turbine support structures: A state-of-the-art review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 161, (2022); Yang, Yang, An Overview on Structural Health Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Offshore Wind Turbine Support Structures, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 12, 3, (2024); Rohit, Trishwanth T., To design & simulate an off-shore wind turbine system and monitor its performance in real time, AIP Conference Proceedings, 3161, 1, (2024); Wang, Mengmeng, Recent progress on reliability analysis of offshore wind turbine support structures considering digital twin solutions, Ocean Engineering, 232, (2021); Glišić, Branko, Concise Historic Overview of Strain Sensors Used in the Monitoring of Civil Structures: The First One Hundred Years, Sensors, 22, 6, (2022); Gao, Ke, Review of Flexible Piezoresistive Strain Sensors in Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 19, (2022); Bado, Mattia Francesco, A review of recent distributed optical fiber sensors applications for civil engineering structural health monitoring, Sensors, 21, 5, pp. 1-83, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The fairing is made from geometrically anisotropic thermoplastic rubber morphing skin panels, which are 3D-printed multi-material thermoplastic polyurethane sandwich panels combining flexible facesheets with zero Poisson’s ratio cellular cores to provide large extension capability alongside high out-of-plane stiffness. The morphing fairing is designed to cover the gaps in the hinge with a smooth and continuous surface while minimising added torsional stiffness and distortion of the aerofoil cross-section during wingtip rotation. In order to model the mechanical response of this structure at a reasonable computational cost, a homogenisation approach is proposed, wherein the elastic properties of the panel are homogenised to an equivalent shell stiffness matrix through detailed finite element studies on unit cells. These equivalent shell properties are then applied to the three-dimensional geometry of the wing to predict the global response of the fairing during wingtip rotation. This model is then used to parametrically study the effects of varying panel and fairing design parameters on the two design objectives of minimising torsional stiffness and cross-section distortion. The study indicates that cross-section distortion is best minimised by increasing the skin panel’s core thickness, with the other panel design variables having significantly less impact. In contrast, all design variables significantly affect torsional stiffness, with decreasing facesheet thickness and increasing core chevron wall length and chevron angle being particularly effective at reducing torque. The impact of pre-straining the skin panels is also studied, as is the use of additional internal ribs within the fairing, where both approaches reduce distortion at the cost of modestly higher torque. Together, these results clearly indicate the underlying design trends, useful ranges of design variables, and the strong competition between design objectives. © 2025 The Author(s).

The uniqueness lies in the hybridization of carbon and basalt fibre-based laminated composite structures in conjunction with a PET foam core for sandwich plates, aiming for an optimal balance of high strength, environmental benefits, and lightweight properties. The finite element (FE) software ABAQUS is employed for the free vibration analysis of sandwich plates, employing eight-noded three-dimensional (C3D8R) elements, each with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) at each node. The engineering constants of the carbon/basalt hybrid reinforced composite laminated face layers and PET foam core layer are derived from uniaxial tensile and compression tests respectively and used as input in ABAQUS. Subsequently, a set of experimental modal analysis (EMA) is performed using the roving impact hammer method to capture the natural frequencies (NFs) of the sandwich plates with similar material and geometrical properties used for the free vibration analysis in the ABAQUS platform. The obtained natural frequencies from the numerical simulation and EMA are compared and found to be highly consistences. Also, the flexural responses of different sandwich plates are analyzed through the three-point bending (TPB) test. Subsequently, the effect of geometrical parameters on the natural frequencies of the sandwich plates is examined under various boundary conditions. One notable candidate that promises to change the field of structural engineering and lead to more resilient and efficient designs is the sandwich plate with PET foam core and carbon-basalt reinforced laminated face layers. The detailed evaluation of flexural and vibration behaviours offers insights for optimized design and a better understanding of hybrid composite materials, particularly for lightweight structures in automotive and aerospace applications. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers","ABAQUS platform; Carbon-basalt skins; Hamilton principle; Impact hammer modal test; Natural frequency; PET foam","Bending moments; Bending tests; Carbon carbon composites; Compression testing; Dynamic response; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Hydroelasticity; Laminated composites; Light weight structures; Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Shock testing; Structural dynamics; Tensile testing; Vibration analysis; ABAQUS platform; Carbon-basalt skin; Foam core; Hamilton's principle; Impact hammer modal test; Impact hammers; Modal test; PET foam; Reinforced composites; Sandwich plates; ABAQUS","Ding, Zhe, Multi-scale topological design of asymmetric porous sandwich structures with unidentical face sheets and composite core, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 422, (2024); Liu, Jun, Free vibration and transient dynamic response of functionally graded sandwich plates with power-law nonhomogeneity by the scaled boundary finite element method, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 376, (2021); Dong, Yihao, Topology optimization of multi-gradient composite, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 393, (2022); Huang, Qun, A Fourier-related double scale analysis on the instability phenomena of sandwich plates, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 318, pp. 270-295, (2017); Sharei, Alireza, Experimental and numerical investigation of low velocity impact on hybrid short-fiber reinforced foam core sandwich panel, Journal of Composite Materials, 55, 29, pp. 4375-4385, (2021); Rikards, Rolands B., Finite element analysis of vibration and damping of laminated composites, Composite Structures, 24, 3, pp. 193-204, (1993); Montazeri, Amin, Enhancing the compressive properties of re-entrant honeycombs by line defects with insight from nature, Materials Today Communications, 38, (2024); Fatahi, Mohammad Hossein, Experimental and numerical implementation of auxetic substrate for enhancing voltage of piezoelectric sandwich beam harvester, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 27, pp. 6107-6117, (2022); Kant, Tarun, Thermal buckling analysis of skew fibre-reinforced composite and sandwich plates using shear deformable finite element models, Composite Structures, 49, 1, pp. 77-85, (2000); Wang, C.

However, its effect on mechanical properties – whether enhancing or degrading – remains poorly understood. To explore this, we generated 50,000 Voronoi network architectures with varying degrees of disorder and evaluated their mechanical response under uniaxial tensile stress using high-throughput finite-element simulations. Our analysis revealed two distinct failure mechanisms, with some disordered networks outperforming regular hexagonal honeycombs by up to 20% in strength and 100% in toughness, effectively overcoming the conventional strength-toughness trade-off. Remarkably, optimal architectures emerged across all disorder levels, challenging prior assumptions that such performance is achievable only with quasi-order. The mechanical impact of disorder is driven by local geometric features that determine whether the disorder has a positive or negative effect. By training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on this dataset, we accurately predicted mechanical properties, quickly identifying configurations that exceed traditional limits. This approach offers a pathway for designing lightweight, strong, and tough metamaterials by utilizing disorder to enhance mechanical performance. © 2024","Disorder; Machine learning; Mechanical properties; Progressive failure","Metamaterials; Plant diseases; Degree of disorder; Disorder; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Mechanical response; Progressive failure; Property; Trade off; Uniaxial tensile; Voronoi; Convolutional neural networks","Curtin, W.

The temperature data are then imported into ABAQUS numerical models of non-prismatic composite girders with trapezoidal steel corrugated webs (TSCWs) for thermo-structural analysis by the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element (FE) coupling method. The study presents a comprehensive investigation into the shearing performance differences of three common bridge configurations—simply supported girders, continuous girders, and rigid frame girders—under localized fire conditions, offering insightful comparisons with room temperature conditions. Additionally, this work examines the influence of elevated fire temperature on the Resal effect in non-prismatic girders with TSCWs. The findings indicate that, compared to room temperature conditions, the shearing stress distribution in the fire-affected mid-span of these girders becomes uneven, with a significant concentration of stress observed at the junction between the TSCWs and concrete slabs. Notably, the additional bending moments induced by the elevated fire temperature counteract the positive impacts of the Resal effect, adversely affecting the shearing performance of the TSCWs. Furthermore, in three-span continuous girders and rigid frame girders exposed to localized fire, the shearing stress distribution in the fire-unaffected side spans shows an opposing trend, resulting from the influence of temperature-resistant moments at the supports. Finally, it reveals that while the temperature effect primarily influences the shearing stress distribution in simply supported girders, it simultaneously alters the shearing stress distribution and modifies the magnitude of the total shearing force in continuous girders and rigid frame girders. © 2025","Non-prismatic girders; Resal effect; Shearing performance; Trapezoidal Steel Corrugated Webs; Vehicle fire","ABAQUS; Aerodynamics; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Honeycomb structures; Rigid structures; Shear stress; Shearing; Steel beams and girders; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Structural frames; Continuous girders; Corrugated web; Non-prismatic; Non-prismatic girder; Resal effect; Shearing performance; Shearing stress; Stresses distribution; Trapezoidal steel corrugated web; Vehicle fires; Computational fluid dynamics","Zhang, Gang, Review and discussion on fire behavior of bridge girders, Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering (English Edition), 9, 3, pp. 422-446, (2022); Kodur, Venkatesh K.R., Fire hazard in concrete bridges: review, assessment and mitigation strategies, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 20, 10, pp. 1577-1594, (2024); Naser, M.

To effectively analyze the random-vibration characteristics of the sandwich panel with this type of core, a 2D equivalent Reissner–Mindlin model (2D-ERM) is developed using the variational asymptotic method. The precision of the 2D-ERM in free vibration analysis were validated using free modal vibration test of 3D printed specimens. Its precision in random vibration analysis was confirmed through comparison with 3D Finite Element (FE) simulations, including PSD/RMS responses. Modal analysis indicated that the relative error of 2D-ERM in predicting the first six eigenfrequencies remains below 2%, with the modal clouds demonstrating high reliability. Under base acceleration excitation, the displacement-PSD, velocity-PSD, and acceleration-PSD curves, along with RMS values obtained from 2D-ERM agree well with those from 3D-FEM for various boundary conditions, with the maximum error less than 5%. The length-to-thickness ratio of the extending strut significantly influences the equivalent stiffness, while the re-entrant angle and length-to-thickness ratio of the inclined strut exert the greatest impact on the eigenfrequency and displacement-PSD peak. Compared to SP-3D-XYAS, the equivalent density of SP-3D-OAC is reduced by up to 20%, while still achieving a low displacement-PSD peak. This balance, combined with the absence of coupling effects, makes SP-3D-OAC especially well-suited for applications in precision equipment supports and vibration isolation materials. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Equivalent model; Mechanical metamaterials; Multi-directional zero Poisson's ratio; Random vibration analysis; Sandwich panel; Variational asymptotic method","Asymptotic analysis; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Honeycomb structures; Modal analysis; Sandwich structures; Struts; Variational techniques; Vibration analysis; Equivalent modeling; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Multi-directional zero poisson ratio; Random vibration analysis; Random vibrations; Reissner-Mindlin model; Sandwich panel; Variational asymptotic methods; Zero Poisson's ratios; Poisson ratio","Karsandik, Yasin, Impact behavior of sandwich composites for aviation applications: A review, Composite Structures, 314, (2023); Ganilova, Olga A., Experimental investigation of the thermoelastic performance of an aerospace aluminium honeycomb composite panel, Composite Structures, 257, (2021); Korupolu, D.

This class includes metamaterials exhibiting multistability, characterized by negative stiffness, which enables energy entrapment during transitions between equilibrium states, making them suitable for applications such as lightweight protective systems. In this study, in three folds, we investigate the mechanical performance of a negative stiffness honeycomb metamaterial (NSHM) with unit cells composed of curved double beams. First, the quasi-static compressive response is numerically examined using the finite element method, revealing that this response is independent of the number of cells. Next, we analyze the transient dynamic response of both mono-material NSHMs and bi-material composites, where the stiffeners are replaced by brittle polystyrene, under localized striker and uniform plate impacts. Finally, we present an analytical model for the total potential energy, with solutions obtained through an optimization technique, and validate these results against the numerical simulations. Through these analyses, we study the effects of several parameters influencing multistability. Our findings demonstrate that the bistability ratio significantly impacts the overall response of the honeycomb, and the desired negative stiffness can be achieved with high bistability ratios. Additionally, the contact force peaks resulting from striker impact are found to be independent of the number of constituent elements. The optimized geometry of the lattice is determined through a trade-off between porosity and stiffness, achieved by thicker cell walls. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Cells; Crystal lattices; Dynamic response; Metamaterials; Transient analysis; Bi-material; Bi-stability; Loading condition; Mechanical performance; Metastructures; Multistability; Multistable; Negative stiffness; Performance; Structural systems; Honeycomb structures","Pendry, John Brian, Negative refraction makes a perfect lens, Physical Review Letters, 85, 18, pp. 3966-3969, (2000); Pendry, John Brian, A chiral route to negative refraction, Science, 306, 5700, pp. 1353-1355, (2004); Leónhardt, Ulf, Chapter 2 Transformation Optics and the Geometry of Light, Progress in Optics, 53, pp. 69-152, (2009); Anantha Ramakrishna, Subramaniam, Physics of negative refractive index materials, Reports on Progress in Physics, 68, 2, pp. 449-521, (2005); Maradudin, Alexei A., Structured surfaces as optical metamaterials, 9780521119610, pp. 1-436, (2011); Chen, Yixin, Soft optical metamaterials, Nano Convergence, 7, 1, (2020); Galisteo, Juan F., Self-assembly approach to optical metamaterials, Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics, 7, 2, pp. S244-S254, (2005); Beliaev, Leonid Yu, Photoluminescence control by hyperbolic metamaterials and metasurfaces: A review, Opto-Electronic Advances, 4, 8, (2021); Shalaev, Vladimir M., Negative index of refraction in optical metamaterials, Optics Letters, 30, 24, pp. 3356-3358, (2005); Jibin, Kunnumpurathu, Nanohybrids of Magnetically Intercalated Optical Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance/Raman Imaging and in Situ Chemodynamic/Photothermal Therapy, ACS Applied Bio Materials, 4, 7, pp. 5742-5752, (2021)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Experimental, theoretical, and finite element analyses revealed that the in-situ foaming technique increased the honeycomb's energy absorption by 312.84 % and improved impact efficiency by 61.45 % while maintaining specific energy absorption (SEA). Remarkably, this composite structure surpassed the energy absorption capacity of individual honeycomb and foam. The coupling gain ratio introduced by the foam increases within a certain range as the honeycomb cell size decreases and wall thickness increases, with little influence from the foam's mechanical properties. Water intrusion, leading to ice formation at low temperatures, drastically reduced honeycomb SEA by 94.61 % and impaired mechanical properties significantly. Closed-cell PU in-situ foaming provided exceptional water intrusion resistance, preserving the honeycomb's mechanical performance, including energy absorption and SEA. © 2024 The Authors","Closed-cell polyurethane foam; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structure; Mechanical properties; Water intrusion resistance","Pressure vessels; Rigid foamed plastics; Sandwich structures; Closed cells; Closed-cell polyurethane foam; Composites structures; Energy; Mechanical; Polyurethane Foam; Property; Specific energy absorption; Water intrusion resistance; Water intrusions; Honeycomb structures","Shashwat, Shashwat, A review on bioinspired strategies for an energy-efficient built environment, Energy and Buildings, 296, (2023); Lazarus, Benjamin S., A review of impact resistant biological and bioinspired materials and structures, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 9, 6, pp. 15705-15738, (2020); Ahamed, Mohammad Kaiser, From biology to biomimicry: Using nature to build better structures – A review, Construction and Building Materials, 320, (2022); Wang, Zhonggang, Origami embedded honeycomb with three-axial comparable and improved energy absorption performance, Thin-Walled Structures, 193, (2023); Xie, Suchao, Mechanical properties of combined structures of stacked multilayer Nomex® honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 151, (2020); Sun, Mengqian, Out-of-plane compressive response of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels: Adhesive geometry and bonding effects, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024); Beylergil, Bertan, Experimental failure analysis and mechanical performance evaluation of fiber-metal sandwich laminates interleaved with polyamide-6,6 interlayers through the combined usage of acoustic emission, thermography and microscopy techniques, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 7, pp. 3044-3080, (2021); Yildirim, Ceren, Effect of atmospheric plasma treatment on Mode-I and Mode-II fracture toughness properties of adhesively bonded carbon fiber/PEKK composite joints, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 289, (2023); Çelik, Muhammet, The impact response of a Nomex® honeycomb core/E-glass/epoxy composite sandwich structure to increasing velocities: Experimental and numerical analysis, Composite Structures, 320, (2023); Xie, Suchao, Mechanical properties of Nomex honeycomb sandwich panels under dynamic impact, Composite Structures, 235, (2020)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

This study investigated the low-velocity impact response of sandwich panels with various core designs using finite element method (FEM) and experiments on 3D-printed specimens. These cores include pure honeycomb, pure auxetic, and gradient variations with controlled gradients of Poisson’s ratio, transitioning from negative to positive (NTP), positive to negative (PTN), negative-to-positive-to-negative (NTPTN), and positive-to-negative-to-positive (PTNTP). These gradients were achieved by adjusting the unit cell angle within the core. Under quasi-static indentation, the gradient PTN design improved energy absorption by 26% compared to the honeycomb structure, while the gradient NTP structure showed a 9% improvement over the auxetic core. As for the impact tests, the gradient NTP and PTN structures significantly enhanced the indentation resistance of auxetic and honeycomb structures by 21.3% and 6.5%, respectively. Interestingly, while the optimal core for peak energy absorption varied with impact velocity, gradient structures generally provided superior energy absorption, particularly at lower velocities. FEM results at initial impact velocities of 10, 15, 20 m/s confirmed that structures having negative Poisson’s ratio at their top layer exhibited the lowest penetration depth. Additionally, gradient structures, particularly NTP and NTPTN, demonstrated superior energy absorption capability compared to purely auxetic or honeycomb structures, especially at lower velocities. The study highlights the benefits of utilizing gradient auxetic metamaterial cores in high-performance sandwich structures for impact resistance applications. These structures showed minimal localized damage, reduced densification risk due to uniform crushing, and lower penetration depth. © The Author(s) 2024.","Auxetic; energy absorption; gradient; metamaterial; sandwich structure","Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Poisson ratio; Structural dynamics; Auxetics; Element method; Energy; Gradient; Gradient structure; Impact velocities; Low velocity impact; Low-velocity; Property; S ratio; Sandwich structures","Kolken, Helena M.A., Auxetic mechanical metamaterials, RSC Advances, 7, 9, pp. 5111-5129, (2017); Ren, Xin, Auxetic metamaterials and structures: A review, Smart Materials and Structures, 27, 2, (2018); Barchiesi, Emilio, Mechanical metamaterials: a state of the art, Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids, 24, 1, pp. 212-234, (2019); Hedayati, Reza, Semianalytical Geometry-Property Relationships for Some Generalized Classes of Pentamodelike Additively Manufactured Mechanical Metamaterials, Physical Review Applied, 11, 3, (2019); Zhao, Aiguo, Design and simulation of broadband multiphase pentamode metamaterials, Applied Physics Letters, 118, 22, (2021); Yu, Xianglong, Mechanical metamaterials associated with stiffness, rigidity and compressibility: A brief review, Progress in Materials Science, 94, pp. 114-173, (2018); Nicolaou, Zachary G., Mechanical metamaterials with negative compressibility transitions, Nature Materials, 11, 7, pp. 608-613, (2012); Hedayati, Reza, 3D gradient auxetic soft mechanical metamaterials fabricated by additive manufacturing, Applied Physics Letters, 118, 14, (2021); Hedayati, Reza, Analytical relationships for 2D Re-entrant auxetic metamaterials: An application to 3D printing flexible implants, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 143, (2023); Hedayati, Reza, Gradient Origami Metamaterials for Programming Out-of-Plane Curvatures, Advanced Engineering Materials, 25, 14, (2023)",""

A piezoelectric sensor-actuator pair, coupled with a constant velocity feedback controller, effectively attenuates vibrations produced in the mechanical meta structure.

Also, carbon nanotube reinforcement into the FG matrix-blend (Al-ZrO<inf>2</inf>) of the skin layers substantially improves the structural responses of the sandwich panel.

To address these issues, developing an alternative panel with equivalent mechanical behavior can be a viable solution. Exploring the mechanical behavior equivalency between stiffened composite plates and existing sandwich panels is advantageous due to their potential for similar applications. This study employed explicit finite element modeling using LS-DYNA package to simulate the behavior of these panels. Also, experimental investigations were conducted on stiffened composite plates to examine the effect of stiffener arrangements and impact location on their static and dynamic behaviors. The experiments highlighted the significance of stiffener arrangements in influencing the static and impact behavior of the plates. Additionally, as a case study, an optimization procedure for designing an optimal stiffened plate under ice impact was studied, utilizing the Taguchi method and analysis of variance, to identify the optimal design point. The results indicated that the stiffened plate exhibited a maximum deflection similar to that of a sandwich panel under low-velocity impact, while having a 19.3% lower von Mises stress. This means that the equivalent stiffened plate demonstrated comparable deflection while providing enhanced strength during dynamic loading.

Finite element simulations and experimental validations were conducted using Abaqus software. The results from the out-of-plane crushing tests demonstrate that the SNHRH exhibits superior energy absorption capabilities compared to conventional honeycomb structures, hierarchical multifunctional chiral metamaterials, and spider-web hierarchical honeycombs. Furthermore, the enhanced energy absorption characteristics of the SNHRH-1 are not merely attributable to the incorporation of internal cytokinetic elements; rather, they arise from the interactions among these internal components, which result in more pronounced plastic deformation at the intersections. To further elucidate the impact of geometric parameters on the crashworthiness of the proposed honeycomb structure, this study analyzes the significant effects of relative density, rib angle, and thickness ratio distribution. The accuracy of the finite element simulation results was verified through compression tests. The findings indicate that relative density is positively correlated with energy absorption, specific energy absorption, initial peak crash force, and crushing force efficiency. An increase in relative density corresponds to higher energy absorption and specific energy absorption while maintaining constant wall thickness. Notably, within the same type of honeycomb structure, higher orders exhibit improved energy absorption performance. Specifically, the energy absorption of SNHRH-4 was found to be 88.63% greater than that of SNHRH-1. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","crashworthiness; energy absorption; finite element; Honeycomb structure; out-of-face plane crushing","ABAQUS; Bulk Density; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Absorption behaviors; Energy; Finite element; Finite elements simulation; Hexagonal honeycomb; Out-of-face plane crushing; Relative density; Self-similar; Simulation validation; Specific energy absorption; Compression testing","Afzal, Mahvash, Design and computational analysis of a metal hydride hydrogen storage system with hexagonal honeycomb based heat transfer enhancements-part A, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 46, 24, pp. 13116-13130, (2021); Bidadi, Jamal, Adhesive bonding in automotive hybrid multi-cell square tubes: Experimental and numerical investigation on quasi-static axial crashworthiness performance, International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives, 135, (2024); Cai, Zhenzhen, In-plane compression behaviors of novel reentrant double arrowhead honeycombs with two plateau stress regions, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 28, pp. 10890-10907, (2024); Chen, Yu, Self-similar hierarchical honeycombs in two different fractal layouts: A comparative study of the in-plane crushing behaviors, Mechanics of Materials, 189, (2024); Chen, Yuwen, In-plane compression characteristics of star-shaped honeycomb with asymmetric cells, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 105, (2024); Chen, Jiehao, Crashworthiness Analysis and Multi-Objective Optimisation of Multi-Cell Windowed Structures under Dynamic Impact Loading, Shock and Vibration, 2022, (2022); Deng, Xiaolin, Crushing performance of a novel tetra-missing rib honeycomb: Experimental and numerical studies, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 151, (2024); Deng, Xiaolin, In-plane energy absorption characteristics and mechanical properties of novel re-entrant honeycombs, Composite Structures, 313, (2023); El-Khatib, Omar, Effective elastic properties of sandwich-structured hierarchical honeycombs: An analytical solution, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 265, (2024); Automot Sci Eng J, (2023)",""

The material properties of the FGSBs are modeled to vary progressively in the thickness direction based on a power-law distribution. The uniform, symmetric, and asymmetric porosity patterns were examined to assess the impact of different core configurations. The beams are meticulously modeled using the SOLID186 element, with material gradation and porosity distribution rules explicitly coded in Ansys via its APDL tool. Two boundary conditions were explored, namely clamped-clamped and clamped-free, considering a comprehensive three-dimensional representation of the beams. The accuracy of the proposed approach was validated by comparing the results of free vibration, buckling, and static bending analyses with those from a quasi-3D deformation theory-based finite element model, as well as with findings from existing literature. An extensive parametric study delves into the effects of the porosity coefficient, core porosity distribution, skin-to-core thickness ratio, power-law index, slenderness, and boundary conditions on the mechanical behavior of FGSBs. The study’s findings demonstrate strong concordance with the literature, confirming the precision and reliability of the proposed technique.

However, most prior research has neglected the effect of V-shaped boundary condition on deformation modes and energy absorption mechanisms of sandwich tubes. In this study, lateral blast experiments and numerical simulations were conducted on aluminum foam sandwich circular tubes with four V-shaped constraints to analyze dynamic response and energy absorption mechanisms. A finite element model of a foam core developed using the 3D Voronoi algorithm simulated the deformation behavior of the sandwich circular tube. Three distinct deformation modes were identified in the experiments: localized large plastic deformation, integral bending around the plastic hinge, and overall slip of the structure. The deformation modes and mid-point deflections of both internal and external tubes obtained from numerical simulations showed strong agreement with the experimental results. The impact of the V-shaped constraints angle on the blast resistance of the sandwich tubes were investigated, revealing that while the angle significantly influenced the deformation modes, it had minimal effect on the energy absorption capacity of the structures. Multi-objective optimization of the sandwich tubes was conducted using a combination of the response surface method (RSM) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA).

They are used in key aircraft structures under extreme conditions. To reduce the application difficulty of honeycomb core materials, cutting the samples is essential. Fracture zones or burrs on machined walls weaken welding strength. Based on shear fracture theory, the fracture form of honeycomb wall was determined to be shear fracture. A single factor cutting experiment with controlled cutting state of single tooth was designed. The Johnson-Cook model and a finite element simulation were established. The effect of cutting state parameters on stress distribution and morphology was explained, and the defect formation mechanism under ice fixation clamping milling was revealed. The research results show that the cutting-in angle and single-tooth cutting width significantly impact the stress distribution and morphology of the honeycomb wall shear section. At a 30° cutting-in angle, Y and Z direction tensile stress is lower. The shear section quality is satisfactory, with 95 % shear zone height and 24.77 μm cut-out burr height. At a 0.01 mm single-tooth width, overall stress on the honeycomb wall is minimal, at only 1.892GPa. The shear section quality is better, with 80 % shear zone height and 20.61 μm cut-out burr height. Shear zone height first decreases then increases with the cutting-in angle and is inversely proportional to single-tooth cutting width, while fracture zone height shows the opposite trend. Cut-out burr height is proportional to the cutting-in angle, single-tooth cutting width, and cutting depth. Cutting speed has a minimal effect on section quality. The shearing section quality of honeycomb wall can be improved by using smaller single-tooth cutting width, cutting-in angle and cutting depth and moderately increasing cutting speed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Finite element simulation; Ice fixation clamping; Machining defects; Shear fracture; Superalloy honeycomb core","Aircraft manufacture; Aircraft materials; Clamping devices; Corrosion resistance; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Ice; Shearing; Stress concentration; Cutting width; Finite elements simulation; Honeycomb core; Ice fixation clamping; Machining defects; Section quality; Shear fracture; Shear zone; Single tooth; Superalloy honeycomb core; High temperature corrosion","Ma, Ke, A force-insensitive impedance compensation method for giant magnetostriction ultrasonic cutting system of Nomex honeycomb composites, Composite Structures, 294, (2022); Zhou, Xin, In-plane compression property of S-shaped reinforced honeycomb cores, Materials and Design, 235, (2023); Xue, Pengcheng, Mechanics of inner core debonding of composite sandwich beam with CFRP hexagonal honeycomb, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 293, (2024); Al-Fatlawi, Alaa, Optimization of a totally fiber-reinforced plastic composite sandwich construction of helicopter floor for weight saving, fuel saving and higher safety, Polymers, 13, 16, (2021); Kuo, Chunliang, Effects of the tool geometry, cutting and ultrasonic vibration parameters on the cutting forces, tool wear, machined surface integrity and subsurface damages in routing of glass-fibre-reinforced honeycomb cores, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 104, pp. 59-75, (2023); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); Gao, Ji, Experimental study of electrical discharge grinding Honeycomb tori, Advanced Materials Research, 468-471, pp. 924-927, (2012); Tian, Yebing, Comparative study on grinding of thin-walled and honeycomb-structured components with two CBN wheels, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 81, 5-8, pp. 1097-1108, (2015); Guo, Jialin, Cutting force reduction mechanism in ultrasonic cutting of aramid honeycomb, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 273, (2024); Wang, Yongqing, Analysis of the cutting force of superalloy honeycomb core with ice fixation, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 108, pp. 408-417, (2023)",""

In this paper, two types of new GFRP UT connectors with different cross-sectional forms were proposed, and the effects of insulation layer thickness, connector cross-sectional form, and insulation layer materials on the failure mode, stiffness, peak bearing strength, and shear load slip relationship of the specimens were studied by in-plane direct shear tests. The test results show that with the increase of insulation layer thickness, the failure mode of test specimens gradually changes from failure of connectors to anchorage failure of concrete, and the initial stiffness and peak bearing strength of connectors decrease significantly; Under the condition of the same thickness of the insulation layer, the shear performance of the GFRP square tube cross-section UT ( SUT) connector specimen is better than that of the GFRP circular tube cross-section UT ( CUT) connector specimen; The insulation layer material has a certain contribution to the peak bearing strength and initial stiffness of the connector, but the impact is small, and it is recommended to be used as a safety reserve. Subsequently, the finite element (FE) model of the specimen was established by ABAQUS software, and validation and extension analysis were carried out based on the test results. Finally, based on the test and FE model results, the shear bearing strength prediction equations and load slip model of GFRP UT connectors were established, which have good accuracy. © 2024 Institution of Structural Engineers","GFRP; In-plane direct shear test; Insulation connector; Insulation layer; Precast concrete sandwich wall","ABAQUS; Anchorages (concrete construction); Elastomers; Fiber reinforced concrete; Fracture mechanics; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; High modulus textile fibers; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Sandwich structures; Shear strength; Shear stress; Shear walls; Silicones; Slip forming; Bearing strengths; Direct shear test; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); In-plane direct shear test; Insulation connector; Insulation layers; Pre-cast; Precast concrete sandwich wall; Two ways; Ultra longs; Precast concrete","Faria Oliveira, Thainá, Precast concrete sandwich panels (PCSP): An analytical review and evaluation of CO2 equivalent, Construction and Building Materials, 358, (2022); Environ Sci Pollut Res, (2024); PCI J, (2020); Tomlinson, Douglas G., Analysis and Parametric Study of Partially Composite Precast Concrete Sandwich Panels under Axial Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 142, 10, (2016); Tomlinson, Douglas G., Combined Loading behavior of basalt frp-reinforced precast concrete insulated partially-composite walls, Journal of Composites for Construction, 20, 3, (2016); PCI J, (2020); Jawdhari, Akram R., Thermal-Structural Analysis and Thermal Bowing of Double Wythe UHPC Insulated Walls, Energy and Buildings, 223, (2020); Qiang, Guo, Study on the performance of an ultra-low energy building in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, Journal of Building Engineering, 70, (2023); Zhang, Donglin, Towards ultra-low energy consumption buildings: Implementation path strategy based on practical effects in China, Energy for Sustainable Development, 70, pp. 537-548, (2022); Zhang, Tongsheng, UHPC-XPS insulation composite board reinforced by glass fiber mesh: Effect of structural design on the heat transfer, mechanical properties and impact resistance, Journal of Building Engineering, 75, (2023)",""

Firstly, the curing kinetic of CYCOM970/T300 prepreg was studied using non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Then, thermal analysis of foam sandwich composite structure with different ply thicknesses was conducted using ABAQUS software combined with user subroutines. Subsequently, thermocouple sensors were used to measure the curing temperature of foam sandwich structure. The results indicate that the prepreg ply thickness has a significant impact on the temperature gradient during the curing process of foam sandwich structure. When there are a larger number of prepreg plies, overheating of the prepreg on the foam upper layer occurs, resulting in a significant temperature gradient in the thickness direction of the structure. In this case, reducing the heating rate of the autoclave curing process can effectively reduce the temperature overshoot of the prepreg on the foam upper layer. © 2024 The Authors","Composite materials; Cure; Finite element analysis; Foam sandwich structure; Temperature gradient","ABAQUS; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Subroutines; Thermal gradients; Thermal modeling; Thermocouples; Composites material; Composites structures; Cure; Curing process; Finite element analyse; Foam sandwich composites; Foam sandwich structure; Foam sandwiches; Ply thickness; Prepregs; Sandwich structures","Fu, Yutong, A review on manufacturing defects and their detection of fiber reinforced resin matrix composites, Composites Part C: Open Access, 8, (2022); Zhang, Guiming, Process-induced stress and deformation of variable- stiffness composite cylinders during curing, Materials, 12, 2, (2019); Hu, Shaokai, Layer-by-layer assembling MXene /poly(3-glycidyloxypropyldimethoxymethylsilane) hierarchical structure onto carbon fibers for high-performance carbon fiber/epoxy composites, Composites Science and Technology, 241, (2023); Sadeghian, Abbas, Performance Assessment of Hybrid Fibre-Reinforced Concrete (FRC) under Low-Speed Impact: Experimental Analysis and Optimized Mixture, Shock and Vibration, 2023, (2023); Taghipoor, Hossein, Statistical predicting and optimization of the tensile properties of natural fiber bio-composites, Polymer Bulletin, 80, 12, pp. 13217-13241, (2023); Chandrasekaran, Navin Kumar, State-of-the-art review on honeycomb sandwich composite structures with an emphasis on filler materials, Polymer Composites, 42, 10, pp. 5011-5020, (2021); Song, Shijun, Effects of polymethacrylimide foam reinforced aluminum honeycomb sandwich under quasi-static compression, Polymers for Advanced Technologies, 34, 8, pp. 2482-2500, (2023); Sefidi, Mahdi, Analysis of deformation and failure mechanism of sandwich beams with lattice core under three-point bending load, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Sefidi, Mahdi, Experimental crashworthiness analysis of corrugated-core sandwich panels under impact loading, Ships and Offshore Structures, 19, 12, pp. 2190-2203, (2024); Huo, Xintao, Mechanical characterization and numerical modeling on the yield and fracture behaviors of polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam materials, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 218, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

However, there are limitations in the types and performance enhancement of the current negative Poisson honeycomb sandwich structure (HSS), so to further improve the blast resistance of conventional HSS and reduce the mass of the structures, a butterfly-type reentrant circular HSS is designed in this paper. In this analysis, the JC constitutive model related to the mechanical properties of AL-6XN304 alloy steel was used for simulation, and the explosion load was applied to the sandwich structure using the CONWEP loading mode in ABAQUS, and its explosion process was analyzed numerically in detail. Explosive simulation of square-core HSS is first performed, and the precision of the numerical model is verified by comparing it with the experimental result in the existing literature. Secondly, the dynamic response of the imitation butterfly-type HSS under air loading was investigated, and the blast resistance performance of this structure was compared with that of four HSSs under the same air loading. The effects of explosive mass, cell thickness, cell wall radius, and cell length parameters on the blast resistance of imitation butterfly-type reentrant circular sandwich structure were also explored. Findings indicate that the dynamic response of the butterfly-like reentrant circular HSS is divisible into three distinct phases: core compression, overall deformation, and equilibrium vibration. Compared with the square, circular, reentrant hexagonal, and star HSSs, the center displacement of the front panel of the structure is 22.4, 20.2, 8.8, and 23.0% lower, respectively, and the center displacement of the rear panel is 24.4, 20.6, 7.1, and 8.2% lower, respectively. In addition, the central area of the structure is also the lowest deflection. Therefore, the butterfly-like reentrant circular HSS has the best explosion resistance. The butterfly-like reentrant circular HSS of the front and rear panel deflection and the displacement at the center point escalates as the explosive mass grows, diminishes with the thickening of the cell wall, lessens as the radius of the cell wall shrinks, and lessens as the cell length shortens, the blast resistance of the structure can be further improved. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","blast resistance; explosive shock; finite element; Honeycomb sandwich structure; imitating butterfly-shaped","ABAQUS; Bending moments; Deflection (structures); Dynamic response; Explosions; Honeycomb structures; Hydroelasticity; Impact strength; Levitation melting; Plastic flow; Pressure vessels; Strain rate; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Structural panels; Vibration analysis; Cell lengths; Cell walls; Circular honeycombs; Energy absorption capacity; Explosive shock; Finite element; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Imitating butterfly-shaped; Performance enhancements; Resistance analysis; Sandwich structures","Arunkumar, M.

The ballistic performances of the CCSS with metal face plates hit vertically by projectiles with the nose shapes of conical, flat, and hemispherical are studied analytically and numerically in this paper. Based on the principle of energy conservation, an analytical model of ballistic characteristics of the sandwich ceramic core structure is developed. Numerical calculations are conducted, and the numerical model has been verified by experimental results from references by others. In addition, the analytical results agree well with finite element results. The effects of shape of projectile head, the thickness ratio of three plates of CCSS, and the ratio of shear strength of ceramic core to yield strength of metal face plates on the ballistic characteristics of the CCSS are discussed. It is shown that the conical-nosed projectile achieved the highest ballistic limit velocity (BLV) and the sharper nose increases the normal stress at the impact area thereby enhancing the BLV. The thickness of the ceramic core significantly influences the resistance of the CCSS and the thicker ceramic core enhances the ability of CCSS to absorb kinetic energy from the projectile. Furthermore, an appropriate increase in the yield strength of face plates can enhance the anti-ballistic impact performance of the CCSS. These insights have practical implications for the design of protective systems in military and civilian applications, where optimizing materials for impact resistance is crucial. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","analytical model; Ballistic limit; ceramic core; energy absorption; sandwich structure","Honeycomb structures; Shape optimization; Shear strength; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Yield stress; Ballistic characteristics; Ballistic impact; Ballistic Limit; Ballistic limit velocity; Ceramic core; Energy; Face plates; High-energy absorption; Impact performance; Lightweight materials; Sandwich structures","Palomba, Giulia, Lightweight sandwich structures for marine applications: a review, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 26, pp. 4839-4864, (2022); Wang, Mingshi, Plastic behavior of metal sandwich beams with foam-filled sinusoidal corrugation, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 7, pp. 1620-1632, (2024); Shafiei, Ehsan, Simulation and experimental validation of shear deformation and strength of textile-reinforced composites, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 25, pp. 4569-4581, (2022); Zhang, Jianxun, Large deflection of foam-filled Y-shape sandwich beams under lateral loading, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 14, pp. 3020-3032, (2024); Kilic, Namik, Optimization of high hardness perforated steel armor plates using finite element and response surface methods, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 24, 7, pp. 615-624, (2017); Zhang, Fubin, Mechanical properties of the composite sandwich structures with cold formed profiled steel plate and balsa wood core, Engineering Structures, 300, (2024); Yang, Lihong, Ballistic performance of composite armor with dual layer piecewise ceramic tiles under sequential impact of two projectiles, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 1, pp. 1-14, (2022); Sayyad, Atteshamuddin Shamshuddin, Modeling and analysis of functionally graded sandwich beams: a review, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 26, 21, pp. 1776-1795, (2019); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of multilayer curved aluminum honeycomb sandwich beams under low-velocity impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 177, (2022); Yang, Lihong, Dynamic response of graded PVC foam sandwich panel under air blast loads, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 25, pp. 3694-3708, (2022)",""

However, existing research predominantly centers on chiral honeycomb structures, neglecting discussions on the energy absorption capabilities of anti-chiral honeycomb structures subjected to out-of-plane impacts. In view of this, an innovative design method is proposed in this paper to construct a series of anti-tri-chiral honeycomb structures (MATCH-θ) with missing rib-plate and excellent crashworthiness by skillfully designing and replacing the nodal elements of the anti-tri-chiral structures. Subsequently, the effects of the constitutive angle θ and the wall thickness t of the cellular elements were investigated using a validated finite element model, revealing the energy absorption mechanism of MATCH-θ. It is shown that this type of structure has better crashworthiness performance compared to the conventional anti-tri-chiral honeycomb structure ATCH-90°. In particular, the MATCH-110° structure with t = 0.1 mm showed a 36% increase in specific energy absorption, a 36% increase in mean crush force, and a 35% increase in crush force efficiency compared to the conventional anti-tri-chiral honeycomb structure ATCH-90° with the same mass.

However, conventional computational homogenization techniques, such as the FE2 and direct FE2 (D-FE2) methods, have not yet been integrated with an explicit algorithm because of the implicit framework in their numerical implementation, and thus cannot be widely applied to concurrent multi-level modeling of transient dynamic issues in multiscale materials and structures. In this study, an explicit D-FE2 method was proposed by incorporating explicit integration algorithms into the numerical calculation of microscale RVEs based on the D-FE2 method proposed by Tan [1]. To facilitate this, an extended Hill–Mandel principle which considers the conservation of both kinetic and internal energies between macro- and micro-scales was derived, and the conventional D-FE2 method was modified using the explicit FE method. The proposed explicit D-FE2 method was validated using a series of experiments and numerical examples including drop-hammer impact on multiscale honeycomb, stress wave propagation in porous materials, compressive buckling of multi-stable metamaterials, damage and failure of fiber-reinforced composites, etc. It was validated that the proposed explicit D-FE2 method is feasible and efficient for transient dynamic analysis of multiscale materials and structures, which might be a new avenue of research in the field of impact dynamics. © 2024 The Author(s)","Computational homogenization; Direct FE2; Explicit fem; Multiscale damage; Multiscale dynamic analysis; Multiscale modeling","Buckling modes; Homogenization method; Local buckling; Computational homogenization; Direct finite element2; Dynamics analysis; Explicit FEM; Explicit finite element method; Multi scale analysis; Multi-scale dynamics; Multiscale damages; Multiscale dynamic analyze; Multiscale modeling; Buckling behavior","Tan, V.

The bending performance of the RSSAH is systematically investigated through quasi-static three-point bending tests and finite element numerical simulations. The findings suggest that when subjected to mid-span stress, the RSSAH displays both localized indentation and overall bending deformation, accompanied by notable negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) impact under bending loads. Parametric studies are undertaken by numerical simulations to investigate the impact of compression position, auxetic angle, and face sheet thickness on the bending mode of the auxetic honeycomb sandwich beam. The analysis shows that the RSSAH can exhibit excellent bending performance and, at one of the compression positions, displays double-plateau stress characteristics. It is also found that altering key geometric parameters, such as the auxetic angle and panel thickness ratio, can greatly improve the bending capabilities of the RSSAH, achieving stable plastic deformation and high energy absorption. Finally, compared to star-triangle honeycomb (STH) sandwich beam, traditional reentrant honeycomb (RH) sandwich beam and star-shaped auxetic honeycomb (SSAH) sandwich beam, the RSSAH demonstrates superior bending performance and energy absorption capacity.

Geometric discontinuities have been incorporated in terms of circular and elliptical cutouts in the SFGM plates. The sandwich structure is considered to be comprised of two homogeneous face sheets and a porous FGM core with various cutout shapes and sizes. The variation of material properties from the homogeneous face sheet to the FGM core has been carefully modeled using modified power law distribution. Further, a C0 continuous finite element formulation with a four-noded, isoparametric quadrilateral element with seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node has been employed to accomplish the results.

Therefore, in this study, the carbon fiber reinforced Nylon material (Nylon 12CF) was prepared and used to construct re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb NPR structure. The reinforced (Nylon 12CF) and unreinforced (Nylon 12) specimens were fabricated by 3D printing technology and tested quasi-statically. Then, the quasi-static of the reinforced and unreinforced re-entrant NPR structure and the impact analysis of the composite sandwich panel (CSP) with re-entrant NPR carbon fiber reinforced core are carried out by finite element method. The results show that the NPR structure reinforced with carbon fiber has 112.5% higher failure stress and 113.9% higher energy absorption efficiency than the unreinforced structure. The finite element simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. Under the impact load of a 5 kg object with different initial velocities, the maximum of the displacement of the back face sheet's center point of the CSP with reinforced NPR core is smaller than that of CSP with unreinforced NPR core, especially when the impact velocity is 20 m/s. At different initial impact velocities, the CSP of the reinforced NPR structure core all showed high impact resistance, which was about 1.4 times that of the unreinforced NPR structure core.

In this paper, the traditional hexagonal honeycomb structure and the concave circular-arc honeycomb structure were combined by the parallel method, and a 3D sinusoid-parallel-hybrid honeycomb (SPHH) structure based on the negative Poisson's ratio of elastic jump was designed. The mechanical analysis of the 3D honeycomb structure was conducted through the utilization of the finite element modeling (FEM) in conjunction with an experimental platform, and the study focused on analyzing the dynamic response of honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to low-speed impacts. The experimental results agreed well with the FEM results. By comparing the concave-parallel-hybrid honeycomb (CPHH) structure, the arc-parallel-hybrid honeycomb (APHH) structure, the SPHH structure has better mechanical properties, and the SPHH sandwich panel has better energy absorption and impact resistance characteristics. The energy absorption properties and shock resistance of the SPHH sandwich panels can be improved by adding the parameter t<inf>3</inf> and honeycomb cell filling, and the rigidity of the SPHH panel can be improved better. At a shock load of 10 J, the increase of arc radius R doesn't obviously influence for dynamic response of the SPHH panel structure, but at a shock load of 25 J, different arc radius significantly affects the energy absorption and shock resistance properties of the SPHH sandwich panels.

These include unidirectional and bidirectional gradient designs along the impact direction, while the gradient changes in the non-impact direction are considered. Via the coupling of bidirectional and unidirectional directions, a combined gradient evolution method is further proposed. The in-plane compression characteristics of these gradient honeycombs are systematically revealed based on the validated finite element method at low-, medium-, and high-velocity impacts, respectively. The results show that honeycombs with gradient variations in the impact direction are realized as localized modes under both low- and medium-velocity impacts, while honeycombs with gradient design only in the non-impact direction exhibited global modes and “local + global” modes, respectively; under high-speed impacts, honeycombs with gradient configurations in the non-impact direction showed stepped layer-by-layer collapses, whereas honeycombs with gradient evolutions only in the impact direction collapsed in I-shaped layers.

Elevated stress levels within the residual limb, experienced when wearing the socket and while standing or walking, contribute to patient discomfort. As an initial step in this study, we developed a finite element model of above-knee amputation. Additionally, we designed a prototype orthopedic implant composed of several parts, with the lower section featuring a honeycomb structure aimed at absorbing and diminishing stresses at the interface of the residual limb and prosthetic. In this study, finite element models with and without orthopedic implants were analyzed to assess the feasibility and impact of incorporating a honeycomb structure within the implants on stress distribution, particularly at the stump-prosthetic interface. Models with honeycomb-structured implants, at varying densities, showed a reduction in interface stress to approximately 2.15e-2 MPa and 2.01e-2 MPa, compared to 4.5e-2 MPa in model without honeycomb structure in the implant and 7.97e-2 MPa in models without any implants. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","contact stresses; limb -prosthesis interface; Lower limb amputation; orthopedic implant honeycomb structure","Arthroplasty; Artificial limbs; Braces (for limbs and joints); Joints (anatomy); Knee prostheses; Orthopedics; Residual stresses; Stress concentration; A: Honeycomb; Contact Stress; Finite element modelling (FEM); Implant design; Limb -prosthesis interface; Limb prosthesis; Lower-limb amputations; Orthopaedic implants; Orthopedic implant honeycomb structure; Residual limb; Honeycomb structures","Cagle, John C., A finite element model to assess transtibial prosthetic sockets with elastomeric liners, Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, 56, 7, pp. 1227-1240, (2018); Mak, Arthur Fuk Tat, State-of-the-art research in lower-limb prosthetic biomechanics-socket interface: A review, Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 38, 2, pp. 161-173, (2001); Dickinson, Alexander S., Finite element analysis of the amputated lower limb: A systematic review and recommendations, Medical Engineering and Physics, 43, pp. 1-18, (2017); International Journal of Experimental and Computational Biomechanics, (2016); Chillale, Tejas P., Mechanical and finite element analysis of an innovative orthopedic implant designed to increase the weight carrying ability of the femur and reduce frictional forces on an amputee's stump, Military Medicine, 184, pp. 627-636, (2019); Boudjemaa, Ismail, Preliminary results on the effects of orthopedic implant stiffness fixed to the cut end of the femur on the stress at the stump-prosthetic interface, Fracture and Structural Integrity, 15, 57, pp. 160-168, (2021); Steer, Joshua W., Predictive prosthetic socket design: part 1—population-based evaluation of transtibial prosthetic sockets by FEA-driven surrogate modelling, Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology, 19, 4, pp. 1331-1346, (2020); Steer, Joshua W., Predictive prosthetic socket design: part 2—generating person-specific candidate designs using multi-objective genetic algorithms, Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology, 19, 4, pp. 1347-1360, (2020); Meng, Zhaojian, Analysis of compression/release stabilized transfemoral prosthetic socket by finite element modelling method, Medical Engineering and Physics, 83, pp. 123-129, (2020); Zhang, Linlin, Finite element analysis of the contact interface between trans-femoral stump and prosthetic socket, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 1270-1273, (2013)",""

The natural frequency, damping loss factor, sound transmission loss (STL), and sound field pressure distribution were simulated by the finite element, which was then compared with the AHSP without a polyurea layer. The sound insulation properties of the AHSPs with PML faceplates were significantly enhanced due to the viscoelastic energy consumption of the polyurea layer. By changing the thickness of the polyurea layer and adopting different honeycomb geometries, the sound insulation ability of the sandwich plate could be further enhanced. The average STL rose by 2.3–4.7 dB when the polyurea layer thickness was increased, hence significantly improving the noise suppression ability of the AHSPs.

Traditional sandwich panels consist of a single, thin-shell hollow core layer sandwiched between two solid metal sheets, usually made of steel. However, scientists are now developing novel sandwich panels with superior blast-resistant capabilities, particularly for high-intensity blast applications. Therefore, in the present study, a three-stage circular core sandwich panel is developed numerically to provide blast protection against very high loads of 8–15 kg of TNT. The face-sheets of the panel are made of the traditional steel material, but the core layers are composed of Inconel-718, a nickel-based alloy that can retain its mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The three core layers are separated by two intermediate sheets, also composed of steel. Numerical analysis is conducted by subjecting this novel sandwich structure to blast loads of 8, 10, 12, and 15 kg of TNT at a stand-off distance (SoD) of 135 mm. The study is carried out using a Finite Element solver, wherein the CONWEP blast simulation code is employed, by defining the mass of the explosive in terms of TNT equivalent and the SoD. The Johnson Cook (J-C) material model is used to accurately predict the ductile failure and plastic deformation behaviour of both metals. The data from the blast analysis is collected in the form of front and back face deflection of the panel, the pressure variation on the top surface of the panel, the internal and plastic dissipation energy stored in the panel, and the variation of kinetic energy across the three core layers. The findings from the recorded data show that the three-stage sandwich panel with Inconel-cores can adequately resist blast loads of up to 15 kg TNT, and the back face deflection of the panel at all loads between 8 to 15 kg is within 100 mm. Upon conducting energy analysis, it is observed that the cores exhibit minimal energy absorption due to their limited deformation, and no localised deformation is observed at the central blast impact zone. This is because the three-stage structure facilitates progressive energy dissipation, and the blast pressure is distributed across the three layers. © The Author(s) 2025","blast loading; energy absorption; finite element analysis; honeycomb structure; sandwich structures","Blast resistance; Dynamic loads; Energy dissipation; Explosives; Kinetic energy; Metal analysis; Sheet metal; Structural panels; Terrorism; Blast loading; Blast loads; Core layers; Energy; Face deflection; Finite element analyse; Inconel-718; Performance; Sandwich panel; Stand-off; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures","Nouri Damghani, Mohammad, Numerical study of energy absorption in aluminum foam sandwich panel structures using drop hammer test, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 21, 1, pp. 3-18, (2019); Surya Kiran, M.

However, most existing honeycomb structures have positive or negative Poisson’s ratios, which can easily cause overall instability during failure. Inspired by the asymmetric upper and lower structures of the diabolical ironclad beetle’s exoskeleton, this paper proposes a novel bio-inspired beetle honeycomb (BBH) structure with a zero Poisson’s ratio (ZPR) feature. A combination of experiments and finite element (FE) simulations was used to study the compressive mechanical behavior of BBH under different impact velocities. The results show that the ZPR of BBH significantly enhances the structural stability and greatly improves its compressive performance. The structure exhibits a pronounced dual-platform stress response, with the secondary platform stress increasing by 221.07% compared to the primary platform stress. This is 93.45% higher than that of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb (RSH) structure.

Results demonstrate that the multistep metamaterial exhibits two distinct stress plateaus, with the second plateau stress increased by 134.59% compared to 3D-OUA structure. The validity of the finite element model (FEM) is verified by low-velocity impact experiments, and the effects of geometric parameters and impact energy on the dynamic response are systematically analyzed.

The primary findings demonstrate the advantages of hybrid structures that combine hexagonal honeycomb and reentrant cells. Mechanical strength assessments revealed that the hybrid specimen with a ratio of R3/H2 retained 89% of the flexural strength of the hexagonal configuration (1520 N) while exhibiting 82% of the elongation capacity of the reentrant structure (13.0 mm), indicating a balanced optimization of strength and flexibility. Energy absorption tests showed a significant increase in total fracture energy with the proportion of hexagonal cells, rising from approximately 15.41 J/m2 for fully reentrant (R5-H0) to 17.98 J/m2 for fully hexagonal (R0-H5), highlighting the superior energy dissipation capabilities of the hybrid structures. Impact resistance evaluations revealed that the hybrid configuration R1/H4 absorbed 16.43 J of impact energy, compared to 15.41 J for the fully reentrant structure, underscoring the benefits of integrating hexagonal cells for enhanced stiffness. The row-based hybridization approach allows for precise tuning of mechanical properties, enabling tailored structures to meet specific application demands. Future work will involve calculating the moments of inertia for each specimen to more accurately quantify their resistance to bending and provide deeper insights into the structural advantages of hybrid designs.

The energy absorption characteristics of the BPGH structure are systematically analyzed through finite element analysis and experimental testing. The results demonstrate that compared with traditional hexagonal honeycomb (THH) structures, the BPGH configuration exhibits significant advantages in reducing peak crash forces and enhancing energy absorption efficiency. Specifically, the BPGH structure demonstrates superior values in maximum crash force (MCF) and specific energy absorption (SEA) when benchmarked against THH counterparts. Moreover, BPGH configurations with higher hierarchical levels exhibit lower peak crash forces (PCF) and reduced load fluctuations, leading to a 23.6% improvement in energy absorption stability and a 17.4% increase in specific energy absorption capacity, thereby significantly enhancing overall energy absorption performance. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2025.","bionic design; hierarchical structure; MCF; PCF; SEA","Accidents; Biomimetics; Bionics; Energy absorption; Energy efficiency; Specific energy; Structural analysis; Absorption characteristics; Bionic design; Energy; Energy absorption capacity; Hexagonal honeycomb; Hierarchical configuration; Hierarchical structures; Maximum crash force; Peak crash force; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Huang, Hua, Mechanical Properties of Honeycomb Composite Sandwich Structure with Applications to Precision Machine Tools, Hsi-An Chiao Tung Ta Hsueh/Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 53, 5, pp. 123-131, (2019); Wang, Zhonggang, Crashworthiness of innovative hexagonal honeycomb-like structures subjected to out-of-plane compression, Journal of Central South University, 27, 2, pp. 621-628, (2020); Li, Xiang, Research on out-of-plane impact characteristics of self-similar gradient hierarchical quasi-honeycomb structure, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 28, 5, pp. 676-692, (2023); Liu, Haitao, Energy absorption characteristics and multi-objective optimization of 3D bionic negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb, Materials Today Communications, 39, (2024); Xu, Xiang, Searching superior crashworthiness performance by constructing variable thickness honeycombs with biomimetic cells, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 235, (2022); Zhao, Ying, Study on quasi-static axial compression performances and energy absorption of four-star double arrow honeycomb, Composite Structures, 311, (2023); Gao, Yuan, Energy Absorption and Gradient of Hybrid Honeycomb Structure with Negative Poisson’s Ratio, Mechanics of Solids, 57, 5, pp. 1118-1133, (2022); Lu, Qi, Energy absorption and in-plane mechanical behavior of honeycomb structures with reinforced strut, Composite Structures, 322, (2023); Yang, Xianfeng, Ripplecomb: A novel triangular tube reinforced corrugated honeycomb for energy absorption, Composite Structures, 202, pp. 988-999, (2018); Zhou, Hui, Composite energy-absorbing structures combining thin-walled metal and honeycomb structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 231, 4, pp. 394-405, (2017)",""

The paper composite sandwich structure with corrugation and honeycomb cores is an innovative energy-absorbing component for the shock protection of civilian and military products. This study is to analyze the influence of relative humidity on the drop impact response characteristics, compression deformation feature, and crashworthiness performance by experiment approach and finite element simulation. The results indicate that, under the same drop impact condition, with the increase of relative humidity from RH 70% to RH 90%, the drop impact acceleration of the composite sandwich structure increases by 5%–79%, while the impact duration decreases by 1%–14%. With the increase of honeycomb thickness in the composite sandwich structure, the peak acceleration decreases by 23%–80%, and the impact duration rises by 52%–115%. Throughout compression, higher humidity level results in the reduction of initial peak stress, impact resistance and energy absorption capacity of the composite sandwich structure. With the increase of relative humidity from RH 70% to RH 90%, the yield stress and the plastic plateau stress decrease from 2.5% to 50%, and 1.3% to 51.6%, respectively. The unit volume energy absorption gradually decreases from 7% to 59%, and the stroke efficiency increases slightly with a range from 0.2% to 4.0%. There is good agreement between the deformation patterns of simulation and experiment, however, a little discrepancy regarding the deformation mode of paper honeycomb core layer may be possibly attributable to the variation in material model with hygro-mechanical properties and parameter. The simulation and experimental stress and strain curves all exhibit four stages, yet, the initial peak stress and the densification stress obtained by simulation are higher than those of the drop experiment. © IMechE 2025","crashworthiness performance; drop shock; humidity; Paper corrugation; paper honeycomb","Acceleration; Accidents; Drops; Energy absorption; Materials handling; Packaging materials; Paper; Sandwich structures; Stress-strain curves; Yield stress; Composite sandwich structure; Crashworthiness performance; Drop Impact; Drop shock; Energy; Honeycomb core; Impact durations; Paper corrugation; Paper honeycomb; Performance; Atmospheric humidity; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures","Wu, Wenwang, Mechanostructures: Rational mechanical design, fabrication, performance evaluation, and industrial application of advanced structures, Progress in Materials Science, 131, (2023); Resende Oliveira, Pablo Resende, Bio-based/green sandwich structures: A review, Thin-Walled Structures, 177, (2022); Richely, Emmanuelle, A critical review of the ultrastructure, mechanics and modelling of flax fibres and their defects, Progress in Materials Science, 124, (2022); Sun, Guangyong, Lightweight hybrid materials and structures for energy absorption: A state-of-the-art review and outlook, Thin-Walled Structures, 172, (2022); Jing, Lin, Experimental and numerical study of square sandwich panels with layered-gradient foam cores to air-blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 161, (2021); Faidzi, M.

However, traditional honeycomb configurations often exhibit inadequate load-bearing capacity and limited energy absorption efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel ring-arc honeycomb (RAH) structure characterized by a double-plateau stress response. The mechanical behavior and energy absorption performance of the RAH are investigated through quasistatic compression experiments and validated using finite element simulations. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the influence of cell radius, cell angle, and wall thickness on structural performance. The results reveal that the RAH exhibits a distinct two-stage stress plateau under compression. Compared with the conventional re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb, the RAH structure shows a 140% increase in initial peak stress, a 282% enhancement in plateau stress, and a 191% improvement in specific energy absorption, demonstrating significantly improved load-bearing and energy dissipation capacity. Furthermore, reducing the cell radius and angle, and especially increasing the wall thickness, effectively enhances mechanical performance and absorption efficiency.

For the methodology, a set of simulation experiments is conducted using the uniform design (UD) method. Static and dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) is employed to calculate the maximum von Mises stress (VMS) and deformation in the honeycomb core (HCC) under ASTM tension, compression, and impact load testing rules using ANSYS/Workbench. Additionally, the energy absorption of the HCS model is evaluated from dynamic FEA results. By integrating Kriging interpolation (KGI), entropy weighting analysis (EWA), gray relation analysis (GRA), and genetic algorithm (GA), various optimal design results for the HCC model are obtained, considering maximum structural strength and energy absorption rate, respectively. After applying the multi-objective optimal design procedure, the improvement rate for the maximal von Mises stress is 40.5% comparing to the original design.

The crash box, located between the bumper and side rails, absorbs impact energy, reduces vehicle damage, and protects passengers. Enhancing its energy absorption capacity is essential for improving vehicle safety. Honeycomb fillers are widely used for their high stiffness, energy absorption, and ability to ensure controlled crushing while minimizing peak force. This study evaluates three crash box designs under impact tests using a 600 kg impactor. Sample S1 was an empty crash box, S2 was filled with graded-cell thickness honeycomb, and S3 was filled with graded-cell size honeycomb. Numerical simulations were conducted using the ABAQUS software. Results showed that S3 outperformed S1 and S2, demonstrating superior energy absorption (19.56 kJ vs. 2.35 kJ and 7.97 kJ, respectively), specific energy absorption (5.93 kJ/kg vs. 1.16 kJ/kg and 2.67 kJ/kg), and crush force efficiency (43.90 vs. 25.30 and 31.09).

This study investigates the impact response of such sandwich structures, specifically those incorporating titanium/Kevlar fiber metal laminate (FML) facesheets with an aluminum foam core, under intermediate- and high-velocity impact regimes. Special emphasis is placed on the role of FML facesheets in enhancing energy absorption and impact resistance compared to selected metallic facesheets. The tests were conducted using an inverse perforation technique at velocities exceeding 100 m/s, employing a high-speed gas launcher and an instrumented perforator to record the impact-to-perforation force and displacement. Complementary three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed using the LS-DYNA explicit finite element code with appropriate constitutive material models to predict the material response. Experimental impact force–displacement curves were used to validate the numerical results, which were subsequently leveraged to better understand the complex behavior and failure mechanisms of the sandwich configurations at increasing penetration velocities. The findings reveal that both the panel response and failure mechanisms strongly depend on the penetration velocity and facesheet materials, with the FML-skinned configurations exhibiting superior performance, particularly in applications where a high strength-to-weight ratio is critical. © The Author(s) 2025","aluminum foam core; FE simulation; fiber metal laminates (FML); high velocity impact; inversed perforation test; penetration mechanisms; sandwich panels","Aluminum; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Laminates; Outages; Perforators; Structural panels; Titanium; Aluminium foam; Aluminum foam core; Fe simulation; Fiber metal laminate; Fibre Metal Laminates; Foam core; High-velocity impact; Inversed perforation test; Penetration mechanisms; Sandwich panel; Sandwich structures","Kausar, Ayesha, State-Of-The-Art of Sandwich Composite Structures: Manufacturing—to—High Performance Applications, Journal of Composites Science, 7, 3, (2023); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Guo, Haoyuan, Review of sandwich structures under impact loadings: Experimental, numerical and theoretical analysis, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024); Compos Struct, (2020); Singh, Prabhjot, Metal-faced sandwich composite panels: A review, Thin-Walled Structures, 195, (2024); Cheng, Ying, Compressive Properties and Energy Absorption of Aluminum Foams with a Wide Range of Relative Densities, Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance, 27, 8, pp. 4016-4024, (2018); Liu, Chengjun, Impact responses of sandwich panels with fibre metal laminate skins and aluminium foam core, Composite Structures, 182, pp. 183-190, (2017); Quanjin, Ma, A review of the recent trends on core structures and impact response of sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 55, 18, pp. 2513-2555, (2021); Ramadhan, Ayad A., High velocity impact response of Kevlar-29/epoxy and 6061-T6 aluminum laminated panels, Materials and Design, 43, pp. 307-321, (2013)",""

In this study, an improved honeycomb composite structure is proposed by introducing a styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) elastomer interlayer between the CFRP skin of the traditional composite structure and replacing the traditional hexagonal aluminum honeycomb core with a bio-inspired pomelo peel-like aluminum honeycomb core (Hg). First, drop-weight impact tests were conducted at 10 J impact energy to compare the impact resistance and energy absorption characteristics between traditional and improved honeycomb composite structures. Second, finite element models of the improved structure with five varying thickness configurations were established to analyze the influence of CFRP and SBR thickness on the impact resistance. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed by replacing the original hexagonal honeycomb core with Hg cores of varying aperture-to-wall thickness ratios (β) to analyze the influence of β on the energy absorption characteristics. The results demonstrated that the honeycomb composite structure exhibited significantly enhanced mechanical performance after the improvements and core replacement.

However, in the face of increasingly strict engineering requirements, the optimal design of honeycomb structures remains a research hotspot. Inspired by horsetail grass, spider webs, and origami techniques, we designed novel nested folded honeycomb structures with folded cell walls and two self-similar honeycombs nested internally and externally. To investigate the energy absorption performance of the novel structure under different similarity ratios k, folding direction parameters α and r, the in-plane dynamic compression model of honeycomb structures is established by finite element simulation method. Under impact at the same velocity, models with different geometric parameters exhibit Double-X, Stage-V, and I-shaped deformation modes during the compression process, resembling the deformation patterns observed in traditional honeycombs under varying impact velocities.

This study examines the dynamic characteristics of a composite sandwich panel made of GFRP skin and PMI core when subjected to bird impact and calculates the velocity at which the simulated bird can penetrate the panel. The impact resistance of 1 m × 1 m composite sandwich panels was evaluated at three distinct velocities: 82 m/s, 127 m/s, and 149 m/s. The bird failed to puncture the panel at speeds of 82 m/s and 127 m/s but pierced through at the speed of 149 m/s. A precise numerical model, created using LSDYNA, accurately simulates the bird impact test conducted at the specified velocities, resulting in a stronger correlation. Same finite element model is employed to determine the velocity at which a bird may pierce through a 1 m × 1 m sandwich panel consisting of GFRP skin and PMI core, known as the ‘A’ type sandwich panel.

A finite element model was constructed using Abaqus/Explicit, and the model was subsequently verified. A series of studies were conducted on this model. Initially, an experimental analysis was performed on the axial in-plane impact behavior of two types of self-similar hierarchical honeycombs, NCSHH-I and NCSHH-II. The results demonstrated that NCSHH-II exhibited the highest bearing capacity, with multi-platform stress formation observed. Furthermore, increasing the number of fractal layers of concave quadrilateral units at the vertices of the representative sub-units of the structure can effectively improve the impact resistance and energy absorption of the structure. Additionally, finite element models of Conventional Squre honeycomb (CSH), NCSHH-I, NCSHH-II, and NCSHH-III were prepared to examine the effect of the self-similar fractal layer on energy absorption. The results revealed that NCSHH-III provided the best in-plane energy absorption, with its specific energy absorption (SEA) 277.65% higher than that of NCSHH-I. NCSHH-III SEA is 109.32% higher than NCSHH-II, and 19.01% higher than CSH.

However, conventional designs fall short in terms of the reusability of these metamaterials. This study aims to investigate the impact of buckling strip configuration on energy absorption utilizing topological features instead of inelastic deformation, addressing a critical gap in the reusability of such materials. The research seeks new insights into modes of dissipation energy, contributing to a deeper understanding of the integrity of hybrid metamaterials. Design/methodology/approach: A novel ReEntrant auxetic unit featuring a tunable bistable snap-through mechanism is proposed. After investigating three polymer types, the specimens are 3D printed for material characterization. The force deformation and energy dissipation correlations are attempted with a finite element-based numerical investigation approach. Findings: The effect of simultaneous control for topological details was identified quantitatively in terms of components of the total energy absorbed and/or dissipated. The proposed re-entrant structures with optimized strip thickness and ReEntrant angle exhibited reasonably better energy dissipation because of the additional snapping energy. Originality/value: Traditional ReEntrant honeycomb dissipates energy imparted primarily by inelastic deformation. Here, the bistable snap-through mechanism in the present novel hybrid design is focused upon and is computationally investigated for minimal yielding. Hence, the shape is regained during elastic recovery only (without additional load). Such recovery, in turn, ensures the re-usability and post-deformation integrity of the designed unit. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing; Bistable snapping; Energy dissipation; Mechanical metamaterials; ReEntrant auxetic","Elastic deformation; Honeycomb structures; Insertion losses; Metamaterials; Reusability; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Auxetics; Bistable snapping; Bistables; Energy; Inelastic deformation; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Reentrant auxetic; Heat losses","An, Xiyue, Design of Kagome lattice composite sandwich metastructures with high load bearing and low frequency vibration reduction properties, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 174, (2023); Bao, Sai, Quasi-Static Mechanical Properties of a Modified Auxetic Re-Entrant Honeycomb Metamaterial, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 259, 12, (2022); Bao, Yuhao, Mechanical metamaterial design with the customized low-frequency bandgap and negative Poisson's ratio via topology optimization, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 67, (2024); Chen, Yanyu, Hierarchical honeycomb lattice metamaterials with improved thermal resistance and mechanical properties, Composite Structures, 152, pp. 395-402, (2016); Fancher, R., Dependence of the kinetic energy absorption capacity of bistable mechanical metamaterials on impactor mass and velocity, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 63, (2023); Giri, Tark Raj, Controlled snapping sequence and energy absorption in multistable mechanical metamaterial cylinders, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 204, (2021); Karathanasopoulos, Nikolaos, Designing two-dimensional metamaterials of controlled static and dynamic properties, Computational Materials Science, 138, pp. 323-332, (2017); Karathanasopoulos, Nikolaos, Computing the effective bulk and normal to shear properties of common two-dimensional architectured materials, Computational Materials Science, 154, pp. 284-294, (2018); Khalid, Muhammad Yasir, 3D printing of active mechanical metamaterials: A critical review, Materials and Design, 246, (2024); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987)",""

This article presents the concept of an embedded symmetric chiral honeycomb (ESCH), which is developed based on a symmetric chiral honeycomb (SCH). The design rationale for this structure involves filling the symmetric chiral honeycomb with a chiral configuration in order to create a centrally embedded chiral honeycomb. To investigate the energy absorption and deformation behavior of the proposed honeycomb structure, we employed the commercial software Abaqus/Explicit for numerical simulations. To ensure the accuracy of the finite element model, we first fabricated corresponding honeycomb samples using 3D printing technology and subsequently validated the finite element model’s accuracy through quasi-static tests. The results of the numerical simulations indicate that the ESCH exhibits superior load-carrying capacity and energy absorption performance compared to the SCH. For identical mass conditions, the specific energy absorption and average stress of the ESCH are found to be 49.6% greater than those of the SCH, while the initial peak force is 166.98% lower. In terms of deformation behavior, the ESCH demonstrates greater stability than the SCH and more effectively exhibits the negative Poisson’s ratio effect. Additionally, to investigate the influence of various parameters on the honeycomb structure, we analyzed the dynamic response of the in-plane impact force of the ESCH at varying impact velocities and wall thicknesses. In conclusion, the embedded symmetric chiral honeycomb structure effectively enhances the mechanical properties of chiral honeycombs and demonstrates improved deformation characteristics. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","chiral honeycomb; energy absorption; Honeycomb; mechanical properties","Light absorption; Machinability; Weldability; Chiral honeycomb; Deformation behavior; Energy; Finite element modelling (FEM); Honeycomb; Impact response; In-plane impact; Mechanical; Property; Symmetrics; Honeycomb structures","Ma, Fangwu, Crashworthiness analysis and multi-objective optimization for honeycomb structures under oblique impact loading, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 4, pp. 1128-1139, (2022); Feng, Ning, Mechanical performance of 3D-printing annular honeycomb with tailorable Poisson’s ratio, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 18, pp. 3781-3789, (2023); Wang, Zhonggang, Theoretical and numerical analysis of the folding mechanism of vertex-based hierarchical honeycomb structure, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 27, 10, pp. 789-799, (2020); Farrokhabadi, A., Assessment of fiber-reinforcement and foam-filling in the directional energy absorption performance of a 3D printed accordion cellular structure, Composite Structures, 297, (2022); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Optimization of foam-filled crash-box under axial loading for pure electric vehicle, Results in Materials, 21, (2024); Wang, Zhonggang, Theoretical assessment methodology on axial compressed hexagonal honeycomb's energy absorption capability, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 23, 5, pp. 503-512, (2016); Gözlüklü, Burak, Interaction mechanism of crushing of tubes and honeycomb under axial loading, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 21, 6, pp. 566-586, (2016); Sharma, Deepak, Experimental and FEM study on the in-plane and out-plane loaded reversible dual-material bio-inspired lattice structures with improved energy absorption performance, Composite Structures, 303, (2023); Jongpradist, Pattaramon, Optimizing functionally graded hexagonal crash boxes with honeycomb filler for enhanced crashworthiness, Structures, 59, (2024); Quanjin, Ma, Quasi-static crushing response of square hybrid carbon/aramid tube for automotive crash box application, Materials Today: Proceedings, 27, pp. 683-690, (2020)",""

Ship-bridge anticollision facilities should not only protect the structural integrity of bridges but also minimise ship damage. This paper designs a novel ship-bridge anti-collision device based on a trapezoidal foam-filled composite sandwich structure. Using the finite element software LS-DYNA, a ship-anti-collision device-bridge collision model was established, taking into account pile-water-soil coupling. The study investigates the selection of box materials, filling materials and wall thickness for the novel anti-collision device. By analysing the damage characteristics of the ship, anti-collision device and pier under typical collision loads, the optimal material properties were determined. The impact resistance of the optimised device was evaluated under different ship speeds and collision angles, demonstrating that the novel anti-collision device exhibits excellent buffering and energy absorption, effectively reducing the peak collision force, extending the collision duration and reducing damage to the ship's bow structure. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","damage characteristics; fluid-structure interaction; foam-filled composite sandwich structure; Ship-bridge collision; vessel collision protection device","Bridge piers; Foams; Glass ceramics; Honeycomb structures; Piles; Ships; Anti collision; Composite sandwich structure; Damage characteristic; Filled composites; Fluid-structure interaction; Foam filled; Foam-filled composite sandwich structure; Protection device; Ship bridge collisions; Vessel collision protection device; Sandwich structures","American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, (1996); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Banghai, Jiang, Failure mechanism of sandwich beams subjected to three-point bending, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 739-745, (2015); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Brink-Kjaer, Ole, MODELLING OF SHIP COLLISIONS AGAINST PROTECTED STRUCTURES., 41, pp. 147-164, (1983); Carney, Kelly S., Jet engine fan blade containment using an alternate geometry, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 5, pp. 720-728, (2009); Chen, Jiye, Study on the low-velocity impact response of foam-filled multi-cavity composite panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 173, (2022); Cheng, Yuqin, Experimental and numerical simulation of dynamic response of U-type corrugated sandwich panels under low-velocity impact, Ocean Engineering, 245, (2022); Cui, Jian, Failure analysis and damage assessment of RC columns under close-in explosions, Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, 29, 5, (2015); Dhadse, Gaurav D., Finite Element Modeling of Soil Structure Interaction System with Interface: A Review, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 28, 5, pp. 3415-3432, (2021)",""

Inspired by the single-direction gradient topology honeycomb, we have designed a two-way gradient topology star-shaped honeycomb (TWGTSH). This structure significantly improves impact resistance compared to a normal star-shaped honeycomb (SH) and enhances impact resistance in all directions compared to a single-direction gradient topology star-shaped honeycomb (SWGTSH). The crashworthiness of the TWGTSH is analyzed using experimental and numerical simulations. We discuss the effects of wall thickness and gradient coefficients on the crashworthiness of TWGTSH using a validated finite element model, comparing TWGTSH with SH and SWGTSH. The results show that wall thickness and gradient coefficient significantly affect the crashworthiness of TWGTSH. Increasing either parameter can improve the EA and SEA of TWGTSH by about 15%. Compared to SH and SWGTSH, the SEA of TWGTSH is enhanced by 22.56% and 41.65%, respectively.

It is also an important indicator for assessing the damage tolerance capacity of composite structures. The CAI strength is directly influenced by low-velocity impact, which holds significant scientific research implications for evaluating structural safety, optimising design and enhancing material properties. Analysing different impact shapes and angles provide a closer representation of real-world engineering scenarios, rendering results more reliable and valuable. The subject is a CFRP panel with Nomex honeycomb sandwich structure, where both the skin and core are composed of composite materials. Low-velocity impact and compression after impact tests were conducted to establish an integrated and refined finite element model for the CFRP panel with Nomex honeycomb structure. The model’s validity was confirmed by comparing with test results. Various impact shapes and angles were investigated using the established model to examine their influence on the CAI strength of the composite honeycomb sandwich structure. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) Sharper impactors result in lower CAI strength and higher compressive failure displacement. (2) The CAI strength, normalised CAI strength, and failure displacement of the structure increase with the impact angles. Among the tested angles, the 30° impact angle induced the least damage, exhibiting the highest CAI strength, normalised CAI strength, and failure displacement. However, as the angle increases, energy losses between the impactor and specimen increase, impact energy decrease. Consequently, the structural indicators decrease compared to the 30° impact angle. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CAI strength; impact angle; impact shape; Nomex honeycomb sandwich structure","Compressive strength; Energy dissipation; Failure (mechanical); Safety engineering; Sandwich structures; Compression-after-impact strengths; Engineering applications; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact angles; Impact failures; Impact shape; Impactors; Low velocity impact; Nomex honeycomb sandwich structure; Nomex honeycombs; Honeycomb structures","Rajput, Moeen S., Evaluation of test methods and face-sheet thickness effects in damage tolerance assessment of composite sandwich plates, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 2, pp. 1340-1366, (2022); Medina, S.

Using triangles as the impact-resistant units, honeycomb-like structured elastomers were designed and fabricated. Based on the drop weight impact test and FEA analysis, the dynamic response of the honeycomb-like structured elastomers during the drop impact process was investigated. Subsequently, the effects of the angle of the base angle of the triangular cells, the thickness of the sample, and the number of internal layers on the impact resistance of the honeycomb-like structured elastomers were discussed. The results indicated that an increase in the base angle would enhance structural density and impact resistance.

Thicker elastomers provided more deformation space, thereby enhancing impact resistance.

The finite element analysis model of high-speed impact and progressive damage of sandwich panels with cross-grid cores is established. The model is used to study the high-speed impact response characteristics of sandwich panels, to explore the influence of panel geometric parameters on its high-speed impact resistance, and to discuss the energy absorption of panels at different impact velocities. In addition, compared with the traditional honeycomb sandwich panel, the advantages and disadvantages of energy absorption efficiency and impedance impact are compared. The results show that the thermoplastic CF/PEEK sandwich structures with cross-grid cores were proposed to have an attenuation effect on the impact and can provide some protection for the object located behind the panel. The main contributors to its impact energy absorption are the front and rear panels. Once a certain speed limit is reached, the energy absorption rate of the front and rear panels is basically the same. The maximum strain at the front of the sandwich panel is about 5%.

The experimental results show that CSCH-1 and CSCH-2 have better load-bearing capacity and energy-absorbing properties than CH.

However, their geometrical design and resulting mechanical properties are typically fixed during fabrication. Despite efforts to implement covalent adaptable networks (CANs) into metamaterials for permanent shape reconfigurability, emphasis is given to global rather than local shape reconfiguration. Furthermore, the change of effective material properties like Poisson's ratio remains to be explored. In this work, a non-isocyanate polyurethane elastomeric CAN, which can be thermally reconfigured, is introduced into a metamaterial architecture. Structural reconfiguration allows for the local and global reprogramming of the Poisson's ratio with change of unit cell angle from 60° to 90° for the auxetic and 120° to 90° for the honeycomb metamaterial. The respective Poisson's ratio changes from −1.4 up to −0.4 for the auxetic and from +0.7 to +0.2 for the honeycomb metamaterial. Carbon nanotubes are deposited on the metamaterials to enable global and spatial electrothermal heating for on-demand reshaping with a heterogeneous Poisson's ratio ranging from −2 to ≈0 for a single auxetic or +0.6 to ≈0 for a single honeycomb metamaterial. Finite element simulations reveal how permanent geometrical reconfiguration results from locally and globally relaxed heated patterns. © 2024 The Author(s).

They are intentionally designed to collapse in a controlled manner during frontal collisions. The objective of this research is to enhance the energy absorption capabilities of crash boxes through the integration of strut-based lattice patterns. Initially, crash boxes of various geometries suitable for lattice insertion were selected and optimized by analyzing their energy absorption capacity using ABAQUS software. The analysis revealed that the square crash box exhibited the highest energy absorption. Subsequently, the procedure entailed integrating various unit cell-based lattice patterns into square crash box. These constructed models were subjected to simulations to evaluate their specific energy absorption (SEA) performance, which is ratio of energy absorbed to its mass. The simulation outcomes conclusively determined the body-centered cubic (BCC) crash box as the most effective among the considered structures. During optimization, fine-Tuning the BCC crash box has been done by adjusting unit cell dimensions and strut diameter, which boosts energy absorption by 30.16% compared to the initial square crash box. While comparing present structures with honeycomb structures, the peak load values in present structures are lower than those in honeycomb structures. © © 2024 by ASME.","crash box; finite element analysis; impact test; lattice structures","ABAQUS; Accidents; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Pressure vessels; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Absorbing components; Automotive crashes; Body-centred cubic; Crash box; Design and analysis; Energy; Finite element analyse; Impact test; Lattice patterns; Lattice structures; Struts","Hussain, N.

If the crushing velocity is constant, the energy absorption occurs at the constant plateau stage upto densification of the structure. Method: An analytical equation based on the shock wave propagation analogy in a rigid, perfectly plastic, locking material model is deduced from the study of periodic collapse of the structure. Our analysis enables us to theoretically predict the dynamic crushing strength. The formulation not only depends on the geometric and material characteristics of the auxetic but also on the impact velocity. Results: Two series of Finite Element simulations of quasi-static and dynamic compressive test of the auxetic structure were carried out using the RADIOSSTM explicit solver. The first simulation series consists of a crushing plate loading the structure at a constant imposed velocity (0.5 m/s up to 100 m/s). Results show good accordance between analytical and Finite Element results. The time history of the cell-strain (ratio of deformed cell height to initial cell height) in the crushing direction shows that the peaks observed in the stress–strain curve of the entire structure are linked to complete crushing of each unit cell within a row. The second simulation series replicates the impact of the plate on the structure (initial plate velocities 50 m/s up to 100 m/s). Conclusion: The numerical simulations presented in this study, make it possible to relate the cell-strain, energy absorption and geometrical/material parameters of the auxetic structure. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Auxetic structure; Explicit simulation; Finite element model; Impact","","Gibson, Lorna J., MECHANICS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL CELLULAR MATERIALS., 382, 1782, pp. 43-59, (1982); Metal Foams A Design Guide, (2000); Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids: Structure and properties, second edition, pp. 1-510, (2014); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Carneiro, Vítor Hugo Pimenta, Auxetic materials - A review, Materials Science-Poland, 31, 4, pp. 561-571, (2013); Dong, Zhichao, Experimental and numerical studies on the compressive mechanical properties of the metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb, Materials and Design, 182, (2019); Simpson, Jonathan, Crushing investigation of crash boxes filled with honeycomb and re-entrant (auxetic) lattices, Thin-Walled Structures, 150, (2020); Abdullah, N.

The aim is to determine whether a sustainable core material, such as cork wood, can serve as a reliable alternative to the commonly used Polystyrene (PS) foam core in sandwich structures. Impact experiments were conducted at varying energy levels using an INSTRON CEAST 9350 drop tower, demonstrating the superiority of sandwich structures compared to single-material alternatives. Numerical models were developed in ABAQUS, where glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite panels were represented using solid element C3D8R and the 3D Hashin failure criteria, which were incorporated via the user subroutine VUMAT. The results indicate that the contact force of the sandwich structure with a wood core surpassed that of the foam core counterpart. In both sandwich structures, damage initially occurred at the impact point on the surface, leading to plastic deformation and damage within the core, while the composite panel on the rear surface ultimately failed. These findings provide valuable insights for designers, enabling parametric studies to select appropriate core materials that enhance the impact resistance of sandwich structures. © 2024 by the authors.","failure process; finite element simulation; impact experiment; sandwich structure","ABAQUS; Foams; Fracture mechanics; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Subroutines; Wood; Composite panels; Composite sandwich structure; Core material; Experimental and numerical studies; Failure process; Finite elements simulation; Foam core; Impact experiment; Impact response; Mechanical response; Sandwich structures","Politano, Grazia Giuseppina, Micro-Raman investigation of Ag/graphene oxide/Au sandwich structure, Materials Research Express, 6, 7, (2019); Elamin, Mohammed A., Impact damage of composite sandwich structures in arctic condition, Composite Structures, 192, pp. 422-433, (2018); Zhang, Guoqi, Energy absorption and low velocity impact response of polyurethane foam filled pyramidal lattice core sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 108, 1, pp. 304-310, (2014); Rong, Yu, Effects of geometric configurations of corrugated cores on the local impact and planar compression of sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 152, pp. 324-335, (2018); Fu, Kunkun, Low-velocity impact behaviour of a shear thickening fluid (STF) and STF-filled sandwich composite panels, Composites Science and Technology, 165, pp. 74-83, (2018); Morada, G., Low-velocity impact resistance of ATH/epoxy core sandwich composite panels: Experimental and numerical analyses, Composites Part B: Engineering, 114, pp. 418-431, (2017); Yang, Xiaoning, Low-velocity impact responses of UHMWPE fiber/epoxy laminates with plasma treatment and polypyrrole grafting, Materials Letters, 362, (2024); Yang, Shijie, Effect of core structure on the quasi-static bending behaviors and failure mechanisms of aluminum foam sandwiches at elevated temperatures, Materials Characterization, 208, (2024); Brekken, Kristoffer Aune, On the ballistic perforation resistance of a sandwich structure with aluminium skins and aluminium foam core, Materials Letters, 351, (2023); Zeng, Chengjun, Bending performance and failure behavior of 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composite corrugated sandwich structures with shape memory capability, Composite Structures, 262, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Like existing solid non-pneumatic tyres, FS-NPTs are puncture-proof and will reduce the burden of tyre maintenance. Unlike existing solid tyres, FS-NPT performance is based on the properties of flexible structures (spokes), such as honeycombs, which can deform to offer superior cushioning and return to their original shape upon unloading. The results presented here indicate that the geometry of these spokes can be tuned to replicate the vertical stiffness of existing pneumatic tyres commonly used in wheelchairs while achieving higher rotational stiffness and reduced mass. Vertical stiffness is directly linked to user comfort while increased rotational stiffness is associated with increased wheeling efficiency. Results also indicate that FS-NPTs can change their stiffness to become softer under increased loading. This unique characteristic could enable the development of tyres that are relatively stiff during wheeling (for better wheeling efficiency), and softer during impact loads for better cushioning (e.g. during pavement dismount). The demonstrated capacity for stiffness tuning could enable personalising wheelchair tyres to meet the specific needs of individual users. © The Author(s) 2024.","Finite element analysis; Honeycomb; Manual wheelchairs; Non-pneumatic tyres","computer simulation; equipment design; human; wheelchair; Computer Simulation; Equipment Design; Humans; Wheelchairs","Guidelines on the Provision of Manual Wheelchairs in Less Resourced Settings, (2008); McLaurin, Colin A., Biomechanics and the wheelchair, Prosthetics and Orthotics International, 15, 1, pp. 24-37, (1991); Chiral Analysis, (2018); Sawatzky, Bonita J., Wheeling efficiency: The effects of varying tyre pressure with children and adolescents, Pediatric Rehabilitation, 9, 2, pp. 122-126, (2006); Sawatzky, Bonita J., The ergonomics of different tyres and tyre pressure during wheelchair propulsion, Ergonomics, 47, 14, pp. 1475-1483, (2004); Composites, (1977); Penn, N.

Numerical calculations are performed. The analytical results are coincident with finite element results. The effects of damping, duration of explosive pulse, volume fraction index and attenuation parameter on the nonlinear dynamic response are discussed. It is shown that damping has a noticeable effect on the nonlinear dynamic behavior of sandwich plate.

Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling the fabrication of intricate cellular structures with tailored properties. The use of additively manufactured honeycombs in the field of ballistic protection has not been explored extensively. In this view, the current work presents a comprehensive investigation involving experimental and numerical procedures, to understand the impact response of sandwich panels embedded with additively manufactured honeycomb cores against ogive and conical projectile impacts. Three different honeycomb cores, namely Hexagonal, Star, and AuxHex are additively manufactured using AlSi10Mg powder via selective laser melting technique. Each core is bonded to a pair of 1 mm thick SS 316 sheets. The projectiles are launched at velocities varying between 180 m/s and 260 m/s. Finite element models are created in ABAQUS/Explicit to simulate ballistic impact scenarios. A strong consistency between the predicted results and experimental outcomes in terms of deformation, damage modes and residual velocities was obtained. The results revealed that the sandwich panel featuring an AuxHex core exhibits a superior energy absorption capacity, absorbing 15 % and 12 % more energy than hexagonal and star cores, respectively. Additionally, it was observed that, when compared to a conical projectile, an ogive projectile requires 14 % more energy to perforate the same sandwich panel. Furthermore, the ballistic limit of star and AuxHex panels is found to be increased by 5 % and 9 %, respectively compared to panels with hexagonal honeycomb cores.

Specimens were fabricated using selective laser sintering technology with three different material configurations, including nylon, carbon fiber-reinforced nylon, and glass fiber-reinforced nylon, for comparative analysis. Additionally, some specimens were filled with polyurethane foam. Quasi-static compression tests indicated that both glass fiber-reinforced nylon and foam filling significantly improved the material's stiffness, initial peak stress, and energy absorption, although the “auxetic” effect was weakened.

Detailed three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of twenty-three full-scale columns subjected to rigid vehicle impact are established and simulated, including twenty GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST columns, one GFRP-normal strength concrete (NSC)-encased CFDST column, one GFRP bar reinforced UHPC (GFRP-UHPC) column, and one steel bar reinforced UHPC (steel-UHPC) column. The models incorporate the strain rate effects of GFRP, steel, and concrete materials, as well as the effects of concrete confinement provided by the steel tubes and stirrups. The accuracy of the numerical models is validated against test results. A full-range analysis of the dynamic response of the GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST column, GFRP-NSC-encased CFDST column, GFRP-UHPC column, and steel-UHPC column is conducted and discussed in detail. Furthermore, the impact resistance contributions of each component of the columns are analyzed and explored. The impact resistance of the GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST column surpasses that of the GFRP-NSC-encased CFDST column, the GFRP-UHPC column, and the steel-UHPC column, demonstrating promising cooperation between its components. Finally, parametric studies are conducted to examine the influence of impact velocity and key geometric parameters on the dynamic behavior of GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST columns.

Existing design methods are unable to accurately quantify either the composite action between the inner and outer wythes or fully consider the complex design parameters when predicting the flexural performance of this new type of sandwich panel. In response, two normal concrete sandwich panels (NSPs) and two ESPs were first tested to reveal their flexural performance using a four-point bending test. Test results indicate that the application of ECC to the outer wythe can significantly improve the flexural performance of the sandwich panel, especially in terms of crack resistance and ductility. Subsequently, finite element parametric analysis demonstrated the impact of connector arrangement on the flexural performance, and design formulas for the degree of composite action (DCA) based on connector arrangement were proposed. Finally, a data-driven prediction model integrating experiments, finite element analysis, and neural networks was developed to accurately predict the flexural carrying capacity and ductility of the sandwich panel.

The FE model coupled with LaRC05 criterion was used to study the failure behaviours of intralaminar damage and interlaminar delamination of the W-CFRPs and W-CHSPs. A series of lightning strike tests were performed to validate the FE model. Detailed lightning damage assessments and mechanisms were characterized by a combination of visual inspection, image processing, ultrasonic scanning and micro computed tomography (Micro-CT) and showed good agreements with the FE-predicted results.

Nevertheless, they are susceptible to failure under compression, particularly in marine environments where corrosion leads to material and structural degradation. Stiffener corrosion was not involved adequately in current studies, with an unclear synergistic effect of corrosion damage with structural configurations. This paper introduces a numerical modeling approach to develop finite element (FE) models of panels with random pitting corrosion, considering both corrosion on the plating and stiffeners. These FE models are validated against existing experiments and empirical formulae and employed to investigate the effect of random pitting damage on the ultimate strength of panels. The study examines the impact of various structural parameters, such as plate aspect ratio, plate slenderness ratio, stiffener slenderness ratio, and the height-to-thickness ratio of stiffener web, on ultimate strength under different levels of pitting damage. Additionally, the load-bearing behavior and failure modes of damaged panels are analyzed. An artificial neural network (ANN) is developed to predict the ultimate strength of pitted panels. The findings indicate that the ultimate strength of panels with stiffener corrosion in the form of random pitting corrosion leads to a more significant reduction by about 17.7% than that without stiffener corrosion, potentially altering the failure mode. The proposed ANN model accurately predicts the ultimate strength of pitted panels with and without stiffener corrosion, with a mean relative error of approximately 1.1% compared to FE analysis results. © 2024","Artificial neural network; Random pitting corrosion; Stiffened panel; Ultimate strength","Bearings (structural); Corrosive effects; Honeycomb structures; Ocean structures; Pitting; Plates (structural components); Seawater corrosion; Structural panels; Finite element modelling (FEM); Load-bearing capability; Neural-networks; Pitting damage; Pittings; Random pitting corrosion; Slenderness ratios; Stiffened panel; Strength assessment; Ultimate strength; Aspect ratio","Piscopo, V., Ultimate strength assessment of simply supported pitted platings: A new stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulation, Marine Structures, 87, (2023); Yao, Yuan, Experimental study on generalized constitutive model of hull structural plate with multi-parameter pitting corrosion, Ocean Engineering, 170, pp. 407-415, (2018); Han, Poknam, A study on the residual ultimate strength of continuous stiffened panels with a crack under the combined lateral pressure and in-panel compression, Ocean Engineering, 234, (2021); Woloszyk, Krzysztof, Ultimate Compressive Strength Assessment of Uncleaned and Cleaned Corroded Plates with Locked Crack, Polish Maritime Research, 28, 3, pp. 117-127, (2021); Saad-Eldeen, S., Ultimate strength analysis of highly damaged plates, Marine Structures, 45, pp. 63-85, (2016); Li, Gen, Performance and strength calculation of CFST columns with localized pitting corrosion damage, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 188, (2022); Hu, Zhiyuan, Numerical simulation and experimental verification of random pitting corrosion characteristics, Ocean Engineering, 240, (2021); Feng, Guoqing, Reliability of the ultimate strength of ship stiffened panel subjected to random corrosion degradation, China Ocean Engineering, 31, 1, pp. 11-18, (2017); Nakai, Tatsuro, Effect of pitting corrosion on local strength of hold frames of bulk carriers (1st report), Marine Structures, 17, 5, pp. 403-432, (2004); Nakai, Tatsuro, Effect of pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of steel plates subjected to in-plane compression and bending, Journal of Marine Science and Technology, 11, 1, pp. 52-64, (2006)",""

This paper, for the first time in literature studies the low-velocity impact behavior and damage mechanisms of this novel sandwich structure using a combined experimental and numerical approach. The experimental results of sandwich structures with and without elastomer layers under different impact energies are presented. Finite element models of the two sandwich structures are built and impact behaviors were compared. The differences in internal damage and energy distribution during the impact are investigated to explain the reasons for the differing impact responses of the two sandwich structures. The results reveal that elastomeric interlayers have a significant advantage in enhancing the damage resistance of composite sandwich structures, especially under high impact energy conditions. The key contributions of this paper include the experimental characterization of the impact behavior of composite sandwich structures with elastomeric interlayers, and the explanation of the reasons for the changes in impact responses caused by the elastomers from the perspectives of damage mechanisms and energy distribution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Composites; Damage mechanisms; Elastomers; Impact; Sandwich structure","Composite structures; Honeycomb structures; Composite sandwich structure; Damage mechanism; Elastomeric interlayers; Energy distributions; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact; Impact behavior; Impact response; Low velocity impact behaviors; Low-velocity impact damage; Sandwich structures","Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Karsandik, Yasin, Impact behavior of sandwich composites for aviation applications: A review, Composite Structures, 314, (2023); Feng, Yixiong, Creative design for sandwich structures: A review, International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 17, 3, (2020); Stelldinger, Enrico, Experimental evaluation of the low-velocity impact damage resistance of CFRP tubes with integrated rubber layer, Composite Structures, 139, pp. 30-35, (2016); Liu, Qiang, Experimental investigation blast resistance of CFRP/polyurea composite plates under blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 181, (2022); Guo, Haoyuan, Review of sandwich structures under impact loadings: Experimental, numerical and theoretical analysis, Thin-Walled Structures, 196, (2024); Rolfe, Emily, High Velocity Impact and Blast Loading of Composite Sandwich Panels with Novel Carbon and Glass Construction, Journal of Dynamic Behavior of Materials, 4, 3, pp. 359-372, (2018); Yang, Bin, Study on the low-velocity impact response and CAI behavior of foam-filled sandwich panels with hybrid facesheet, Composite Structures, 132, pp. 1129-1140, (2015); Deng, Yunfei, Experimental investigation on low-velocity impact response of carbon/glass hybrid S-shaped foldcore sandwich structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 180, (2022); Sarlin, E.

Finite element modeling was undertaken to validate the experimental results. Prior to the finite element analysis, a tensile test was carried out to determine the boundary conditions. Injecting polyurethane foam into the honeycomb core does not show any significant impact on bending properties. However, the deformation rate increased considerably by adding PU foam in the core structure. According to the results, honeycomb sandwich panels made of woven glass fiber with PU foam exhibited more homogenous deflection and bending compliance compared with others. © 2024 The Author(s)","Circular honeycomb core; FEM; JUCO fiber; PU foam; Sandwich panel","","Tripathi, Lekhani, Review: 3D woven honeycomb composites, Journal of Materials Science, 56, 28, pp. 15609-15652, (2021); Int Res J Eng Technol, (2008); Thomsen, Ole Thybo, Sandwich materials for wind turbine blades - Present and future, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 11, 1, pp. 7-26, (2009); Saha, Gobinda C., Effective elastic characteristics of honeycomb sandwich composite shells made of generally orthotropic materials, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 38, 6, pp. 1533-1546, (2007); Torre, Luigi, Impact testing and simulation of composite sandwich structures for civil transportation, Composite Structures, 50, 3, pp. 257-267, (2000); Shin, Kwangbok, An experimental study of low-velocity impact responses of sandwich panels for Korean low floor bus, Composite Structures, 84, 3, pp. 228-240, (2008); Khaledi, Himan, Experimental and numerical investigation on bending and compressive behavior of carbon-epoxy sandwich panel with novel M-shaped core, Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials, 36, 4, pp. 1504-1528, (2023); Hosen, Asif, Investigation of flexural strength of jute fiber based circular type honeycomb sandwich panel: An experimental and numerical approach, Results in Materials, 19, (2023); Lu, Chun, Stress Distribution on Composite Honeycomb Sandwich Structure Suffered from Bending Load, Procedia Engineering, 99, pp. 405-412, (2015); Cahyono, Sukmaji Indro, Application of sandwich honeycomb carbon/glass fiber-honeycomb composite in the floor component of electric car, AIP Conference Proceedings, 1788, (2017)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

A finite element numerical model was constructed using Abaqus/Explicit, with model accuracy verified, and a series of studies were conducted. Firstly, the mechanical properties of TCH, TGH, and two types of TGRH-Type Z-AXBYs under axial impact were analyzed. Results showed that the specific energy absorption (SEA) of TGH improved by 101.27 % compared to TCH; TGRH-Type I-170°-AXBYs SEA improved by up to 77.21 % compared to TGH; TGRH-Type II-180°-AXBYs SEA improved by up to 63.84 % compared to TGH. Adding a layer with a larger angle at the bottom of the honeycomb effectively improved the impact resistance and energy absorption of the structure. The mechanical properties of two types of TGRH-Type Z-θ-AXBYs with different layers were studied, showing that TGRH-Type I-θ-AXBYs had the best mechanical properties. TGRH-Type I-θ-AXBYs SEA improved by a maximum of 23.57 % compared to TGRH-Type II-θ-AXBYs and by a minimum of 13.71 %. TGRH-Type I-θ-AXBYs SEA improved by a maximum of 74.95 % and a minimum of 12.88 % compared to TGRH-Type I-θ-6X. Finally, the effects of wall thickness and velocity on the two types of TGRH-Type Z-AXBYs were analyzed. Properly increasing the wall thickness effectively improved the impact resistance of the structure.

The micro-topology of core layers would sufficiently influence the property of sandwich structure. However, the micro deformation and topology mechanism of structural deformation and energy absorption are unclear. In this paper, based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method and periodic base cell (PBC) technology, a topology optimization frame work is proposed to optimize the core layer of sandwich beams. The objective of the present optimization problem is to maximize shear stiffness of PBC with a volume constraint. The effects of the volume fraction, filter radius, and initial PBC aspect ratio on the micro-topology of the core were discussed. The dynamic response process, core compression, and energy absorption capacity of the sandwich beams under blast impact loading were analyzed by the finite element method. The results demonstrated that the over-pressure action stage was coupled with the core compression stage. Under the same loading and mass per unit area, the sandwich beam with a 20% volume fraction core layer had the best blast resistance. The filter radius has a slight effect on the shear stiffness and blast resistances of the sandwich beams. But increasing the filter radius could slightly improve the bending stiffness. Upon changing the initial PBC aspect ratio, there are three ways for PBC evolution: The first is to change the angle between the adjacent bars, the second is to further form holes in the bars, and the third is to combine the first two ways. However, not all three ways can improve the energy absorption capacity of the structure. Changing the aspect ratio of the PBC arbitrarily may lead to worse results. More studies are necessary for further detailed optimization. This research proposes a new topology sandwich beam structure by micro-topology optimization, which has sufficient shear stiffness. The micro mechanism of structural energy absorption is clarified, it is significant for structural energy absorption design. © The Author(s) 2024.","Dynamic resistance; Energy absorption; Impact loading; Micro mechanism; Sandwich beam; Topology optimization","Beams and girders; Dynamic response; Honeycomb structures; Pressure vessels; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Structural optimization; Topology; Base cell; Core layers; Dynamic resistance; Energy; Impact loadings; Micromechanisms; Microtopology; Sandwich beams; Structural energies; Topology optimisation; Aspect ratio","Liu, Hua, Clamped sandwich beams with thick weak cores from central impact: A theoretical study, Composite Structures, 169, pp. 21-28, (2017); Hou, Weihong, Ballistic impact experiments of metallic sandwich panels with aluminium foam core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 10, pp. 1045-1055, (2010); Rizov, Victor Iliev, Indentation study of foam core sandwich composite panels, Composite Structures, 69, 1, pp. 95-102, (2005); Zhu, Feng, Some theoretical considerations on the dynamic response of sandwich structures under impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 6, pp. 625-637, (2010); Zhu, Feng, A numerical simulation of the blast impact of square metallic sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 5, pp. 687-699, (2009); Wang, Zhonggang, Recent advances in novel metallic honeycomb structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 166, pp. 731-741, (2019); Wang, Zhonggang, Crashworthiness index of honeycomb sandwich structures under low-speed oblique impact, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 208, (2021); Shu, Chengfu, Crashworthiness analysis of two-layered corrugated sandwich panels under crushing loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 133, pp. 42-51, (2018); Chang, Wanshu, Bending behavior of corrugated-core sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 70, 1, pp. 81-89, (2005); Wicks, Nathan, Performance of sandwich plates with truss cores, Mechanics of Materials, 36, 8, pp. 739-751, (2004)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

In this paper, a hierarchical-bistable hybrid metamaterial with rigid–flexible coupling design is proposed, demonstrating excellent mitigation performance and protection against multiple impacts. The metamaterial consists of a multi-layer bistable beams with a central honeycomb and is manufactured by 3D printing. Firstly, the negative stiffness characteristics of the curved beams in the metamaterial are theoretically determined, and the convergence of the finite element model under different mesh sizes is analyzed. And the quasi-zero stiffness characteristics of the metamaterial have been confirmed, along with its more stable and uniform deformation pattern, through the quasi-static compression experiment. Then the buffering performance of the metamaterial is studied in ball impact tests, showing an average improvement of about 65% compared to the rigid control group, while verifying the accuracy of the finite element model. With the analysis of the deformation modes and strain energy, the mitigation mechanism of metamaterials is demonstrated to extend the contact time and disperse the impact load through the layered deformation to reduce the peak response, instead of relying on plastic strain. Finally, the reusability of the metamaterial is explored by the ten-times plate impacts simulation. The results demonstrate that the metamaterial decreases the plastic strain of its structure by 60% while reducing impact response, thereby preventing the premature failure of core components. These results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed metamaterials for various engineering applications, including aircraft or spacecraft landing protection, vehicle pedestrian protection, and the transportation protection of fragile objects or precision instruments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Hierarchical-bistable; Impact mitigation; Mechanical metamaterials; Reusable; Rigid–flexible coupling design","3D printing; Ductile fracture; Finite element method; Metamaterials; Plastic deformation; Precision engineering; Reusability; Strain energy; Bistables; Coupling designs; Hierarchical-bistable; Impact mitigation; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Negative stiffness; Reusable; Rigid flexible coupling; Rigid–flexible coupling design; Stiffness","Zhu, Feng, A numerical simulation of the blast impact of square metallic sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 5, pp. 687-699, (2009); Li, Hao, The influence of penetration angle on anti-penetration performance and reverse penetration ricochet phenomenon of UHMWPE laminates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 182, (2023); Zhang, Jing, Experimental study on the response of multi-layered protective structure subjected to underwater contact explosions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 100, pp. 23-34, (2017); Jiang, Lei, Protection performance of a novel anti-collision guardrail with recycled foamed concrete under vehicle collision, Engineering Structures, 305, (2024); Liao, Linxu, A multiple buffering high-fall protection structure and its impact response, Structures, 63, (2024); Zheng, Xiaoyu (Rayne), Ultralight, ultrastiff mechanical metamaterials, Science, 344, 6190, pp. 1373-1377, (2014); Xiang, Xinmei, Energy absorption of origami inspired structures and materials, Thin-Walled Structures, 157, (2020); Liu, Kangjia, Thermal expansion and bandgap properties of bi-material triangle re-entrant honeycomb with adjustable Poisson's ratio, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 242, (2023); Jiang, Weizhong, An improved re-entrant honeycomb with programmable densification and multistage energy-absorbing performance, Engineering Structures, 301, (2024); Zhang, Xinyi, Energy absorption behavior of origami bellows under tension, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 246, (2023)",""

This paper introduces a novel modularized graded honeycomb into a commercial crash box to improve its crashworthiness. Design/methodology/approach: A modularized graded honeycomb is inserted into a commercial crash box to develop a novel crash box. Finite element analyses are conducted to investigate the crashworthiness. Pareto cumulative influence analysis is conducted to rank the effects of design parameters on crashworthiness. A surrogate model-based multi-objective optimization is carried out to improve energy absorption while limiting the impact peak force. An optimal Pareto solution set is obtained. Findings: Modularized honeycomb-filled crash box outperforms that of its corresponding uniform honeycomb-filled crash box and empty crash box in resisting impact. Pareto cumulative influence analysis reveals that for most crashworthiness indicators, cell-wall thicknesses of crash box tube contribute the most, followed by average relative density and graded coefficient of modularized honeycomb (MH). Graded coefficient contributes nearly 10% on mean force and maximum displacement, but it has insignificant influence on peak force and weight. Optimization results show that the optimal designs can not only absorb more energy but also limit the peak force compared with those of uniform honeycomb-filled crash box. Originality/value: This paper fills a MH into a commercial crash box to propose a novel crash box and demonstrates the positive impact of modularized design on crashworthiness compared with that of uniform honeycomb-filled crash box. Moreover, modularizing honeycomb does not change the weight of the filler, and thus, the novel crash box would benefit development of crash box with lightweight and excellent energy absorption capacity. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crashworthiness; Honeycomb-filled crash box; Modularized graded honeycomb; Optimization","Accidents; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Structural design; Crash box; Cumulative influence; Energy; Honeycomb-filled crash box; Influence analysis; Low-velocity; Modularized; Modularized graded honeycomb; Optimisations; Peak force; Crashworthiness","Aghamirzaie, Mojtaba, Optimization of the octagonal origami tube energy absorption using the artificial neural network and heuristic method, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering, 239, 5, pp. 2805-2817, (2025); Barzigar, Seyed Sajad, An analytical investigation on the crushing behavior of thin-walled tubes filled with a foam with strain hardening region, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Baykasoglu, C., Multi-objective crashworthiness optimization of square aluminum tubes with functionally graded BCC lattice structure filler, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 29, 1, pp. 80-94, (2024); Chen, Xie, Zero-Poisson's-Ratio Honeycomb-Filled Braided Textile Reinforced Conical Tubes: Designing, Manufacturing and Testing, Applied Composite Materials, 30, 3, pp. 773-789, (2023); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Optimization of foam-filled crash-box under axial loading for pure electric vehicle, Results in Materials, 21, (2024); Gao, Qiang, Crashworthiness optimization of cylindrical negative Poisson’s ratio structures with inner liner tubes, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 64, 6, pp. 4271-4286, (2021); Hou, Wenbinw Bin, Crashworthiness optimization of crash box with 3D-printed lattice structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 247, (2023); Hu, Lingling, Analyses on the dynamic strength of honeycombs under the y-directional crushing, Materials and Design, 53, pp. 293-301, (2014); Li, Zhen, Design-oriented crushing analysis of hexagonal honeycomb core under in-plane compression, Composite Structures, 187, pp. 429-438, (2018)",""

In compression tests, lattice structures maintain stiffness even when filled with powder, suggesting minimal effect from the filler material. This paper shows the principles of creating finite element simulations with 3D-printed specimens and with usage of the lattice structure.

The experimental findings reveal that the simulation error is less than 8% compared to the real measurement.

A detailed Ls-Dyna model was developed and validated using experimental results from hail impact tests on Carall composite structures from the literature, with the model’s accuracy confirmed through alignment of post-impact damage patterns, z-axis displacement values, and initial energy absorption with experimental data. Mesh refinement techniques, ranging from coarse to fine elements, were applied, revealing that smaller mesh sizes provided more detailed damage representation and improved accuracy in critical areas. Various impact angles (22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, and 90°) were analyzed to simulate real-world conditions, demonstrating that higher angles, particularly 90°, resulted in the most severe damage. Additionally, eight different honeycomb configurations, including hexagonal and bio-inspired designs, were incorporated into the sandwich structure model. The results showed that hexagonal, re-entrant, wavy, and SI honeycombs sustained substantial damage, while spider web, bamboo, pomelo peel, and grass stem designs exhibited superior resistance. Among all, the wavy honeycomb model achieved the highest specific energy absorption (sEA), showing a 5.62% improvement over the hexagonal model.

The 3-D knitted fabrics were produced on a flat knitting machine to form an integrated structure, while the non-integrated structure was manufactured by conventional 2-D fabrics in the identical parameters. The bonding of the core to the skin in the non-integrated structure was achieved by resin. The both integrated and non-integrated structures were fabricated with nearly identical mass and epoxy resin was injected through a vacuum assisted resin transfer method. The integrated 3D composite structures were manufactured in three distinct corrugated core designs: rectangular, hat-type, and triangular. The bending characteristics of the produced structures were measured in the transverse direction of corrugation by 3-point bending process. The results indicated that under equivalent load conditions for long beams, the 3D integrated structure displayed reduced bending deflections and enhanced bending stiffness compared to the non-integrated structure. Moreover, the non-integrated exhibited higher transverse shear rigidity than the integrated structure. It was also found that in long beams, the load-carrying capacity of the integrated structure is higher than that of the non-integrated structure. This comparison demonstrates some advantages of 3-D fabric as a sandwich panel reinforcement compared to lamination of 2-D fabric. Also, experimental results demonstrated that core geometry cannot significantly influence the flexural stiffness of the corrugated core sandwich panels. Finally, results demonstrated that the highest and the lowest transverse shear rigidity can be associated with the hat-type core sandwich panels and the triangular core sandwich panels, respectively. So, the hat-type corrugated core sandwich panel has the lowest deflection against bending force. Lastly, the experimental findings were evaluated against those from finite element analysis and showed a good correlation between experimental and numerical results. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Korean Fiber Society 2024.","3-D weft knitted fabric; Corrugated core sandwich panel; Flexural stiffness; Integrated structure; Non-integrated structure; Transverse shear rigidity","Bending (forming); Deflection (structures); Honeycomb structures; Knit fabrics; Knitting machinery; Rigid structures; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Structural panels; 3-D weft knitted fabric; Corrugated core; Corrugated core sandwich panel; Flexural stiffness; Integrated structure; Non-integrated structure; Sandwich panel; Shear rigidity; Transverse shear; Transverse shear rigidity; Weft knitted fabrics; Rigidity; Cores; Honeycomb Structures; Panels; Sandwich Structures; Stiffness; Structural Analysis; Type","Bending Vibration and Vibro Acoustic Analysis of Composite Sandwich Plates with Corrugated Core, (2014); Azadian, Mohammad, Flexural behavior of composites reinforced with innovative 3D integrated weft-knitted spacer fabrics, Journal of Industrial Textiles, 48, 1, pp. 58-76, (2018); 3D Fibrous Assemblies, (2008); Carlsson, Leif A., On the Elastic Stiffnesses of Corrugated Core Sandwich, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 3, 4, pp. 253-267, (2001); Belingardi, Giovanni, Material characterization of a composite-foam sandwich for the front structure of a high speed train, Composite Structures, 61, 1-2, pp. 13-25, (2003); Zhang, Jin, Improving the bending strength and energy absorption of corrugated sandwich composite structure, Materials and Design, 52, pp. 767-773, (2013); Chakraborty, Sourav, Experimental evaluation and analysis of flexural response of sandwich beam panels with an expanded polystyrene core, Structures, 33, pp. 3798-3809, (2021); 3D Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composites, (2002); Karahan, Mehmet, Quasi-static behavior of three-dimensional integrated core sandwich composites under compression loading, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 32, 5, pp. 289-299, (2013); Wang, Shaokai, Properties of facesheet-reinforced 3-D spacer fabric composites and the integral multi-facesheet structures, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 29, 6, pp. 793-806, (2010)",""

In this work, a star-enhanced auxetic re-entrant honeycomb (S-ARH) is proposed by combining a star-shaped re-entrant honeycomb (SRH) with an auxetic re-entrant honeycomb (ARH). Experimentally validated finite element models are used to investigate the deformation modes, horizontal shrinkage strains, and stress-response relationships of the S-ARH at various crushing velocities. The deformation modes of S-ARH are essentially identical to the ARH. The integration of star-shaped structures causes S-ARH to form a compact zone earlier but with a lower horizontal shrinkage capacity. Additionally, the plateau crushing stress σ<inf>p</inf> and specific energy absorption of S-ARH are also calculated to illustrate the ability to absorb energy and the resistance to impact. A methodical equation for the dynamic compressive strength is derived based on the collapse mechanism of the S-ARH, and the finite element confirms the applicability of the derived equation. Finally, an evaluation is conducted to examine how various structural parameters influence the dynamic performance of S-ARH. © 2024","Auxetic re-entrant honeycombs; Crushing strength; Deformation mode; Energy absorption","Compressive strength; Honeycomb structures; Shrinkage; Auxetic re-entrant honeycomb; Auxetics; Deformation modes; Dynamic crushing; Energy; Finite element modelling (FEM); Mechanical qualities; Shrinkage strains; Shrinkage stress; Star-shaped; Crushing","Siddique, Shakib Hyder, Lessons from nature: 3D printed bio-inspired porous structures for impact energy absorption – A review, Additive Manufacturing, 58, (2022); Yang, Ting, Quantitative 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructure of sea urchin spines (I): Methodology, Acta Biomaterialia, 107, pp. 204-217, (2020); Yang, Xianfeng, Crashworthiness investigation of the bio-inspired bi-directionally corrugated core sandwich panel under quasi-static crushing load, Materials and Design, 135, pp. 275-290, (2017); Zhang, Xiaoming, Experimental, numerical and analytical study to develop a design method for bending and shear resistances of 3D printed beetle elytron inspired sandwich plate (beetle elytron plate), Thin-Walled Structures, 183, (2023); Zhang, Xiaoming, Elastic–plastic buckling behaviour of beetle elytron plate with simple, fixed and flexible core supports, Thin-Walled Structures, 179, (2022); Etemadi, Ehsan, Modified re-entrant auxetic metamaterials with energy absorption enhancement, Materials Today Communications, 38, (2024); Hu, Lingling, Effect of cell-wall angle on the in-plane crushing behaviour of hexagonal honeycombs, Materials and Design, 46, pp. 511-523, (2013); Li, Hao, Broadband low-frequency vibration attenuation in 3D printed composite meta-lattice sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 215, (2021); Hoseinlaghab, Sadegh, Improving the impact resistance of the multilayer composites using nanoparticles, Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines, 51, 6, pp. 3083-3099, (2023); Zhang, Xiaoming, Elastic local buckling behaviour of beetle elytron plate, Thin-Walled Structures, 165, (2021)",""

Therefore, this study computationally investigates the potential for improving the out-of-plane strength of honeycomb cores by superposing periodic sinusoidal perturbations to their cell walls. Such perturbations have been used to enhance the acoustic properties of honeycomb cores. Results demonstrated that introducing these perturbations can improve the strength of honeycomb cores under localized out-of-plane loadings resembling colliding with small objects at low impact speeds. Superposed perturbations increased the out-of-plane strength by a maximum of 28.5 % and eliminated the post-buckling softening behavior. Moreover, they increased the toughness, represented by the area under the force-displacement curve, under localized out-of-plane loads by a maximum of 56.7%.

Sandwich structures that absorb significant kinetic energy as strain energy through plastic deformation offer superior protection. This study conducts a numerical analysis of structured sandwich protective structures subjected to airblast loads using finite element modeling. First, an experimental result from the literature was used to validate and verify finite element models of an architected sandwich structure modeled in Abaqus/Explicit software. Second, parametric studies were conducted on sandwich structures with additional layers of insert plates and newly proposed core topologies for viable shield protection against airblast loading. The finite element analysis results indicated that, under the same impulsive load, the control sandwich panel exhibited higher kinetic energy, demanding a proportionally larger internal energy. Conversely, sandwich structures with additional inner core insert plates dissipated the imposed kinetic energy more efficiently, due to the inelastic plastic deformation of the proposed core configurations. Moreover, the energy absorption capacity and back sheet displacement time-history were significantly improved by dense-hierarchical inner core configurations. Additionally, the parametric study analysis showed that increasing the number of insert plates and designing the core topology of cellular walls to be redundant, dense-hierarchical, and braced against buckling significantly reduced core collapse mechanisms such as folding, buckling, and crushing. However, despite these benefits, a reversed effect on the areal specific energy absorption index was observed. © The Author(s) 2024.","Abaqus/explicit; airblast load; architected sandwich structure; cellular metallic core; stainless steel alloy","ABAQUS; Convergence of numerical methods; Honeycomb structures; Shielding; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Topology; ABAQUS EXPLICIT; Air blast; Airblast load; Architected sandwich structure; Cellular metallic core; Cellulars; Energy; Metallic cores; Sandwich panel; Stainless steel alloys; Sandwich structures","Impulsive Loading of A Sandwich Panels with Cellular Cores, (2008); Design Optimization of Honeycomb Sandwich Panels for Blast Load Mitigation, (2012); Yang, Mijia, High energy absorbing materials for blast resistant design, pp. 88-119, (2010); Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Hussein, Assal T., Blast protection wall systems: Literature review, WIT Transactions on the Built Environment, 198, pp. 93-109, (2020); Int Res J Eng Tech, (2022); Ahmed, Sameh, Response of Metallic Sandwich Panels to Blast Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 145, 12, (2019); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Ansori, Dany Taufiq Alim, Investigation of Honeycomb Sandwich Panel Structure using Aluminum Alloy (AL6XN) Material under Blast Loading, Civil Engineering Journal (Iran), 8, 5, pp. 1046-1068, (2022); Int J Civ Environ Eng, (2016)",""

However, attaining both elasticity and durability at low material density is challenging due to their intrinsic conflicts. Inspired by the mantis ootheca, we present a simultaneous improvement in the elasticity, durability, and density restrictions of ultralight graphene aerogels via constructing a multiscale honeycomb microstructure (MHM) within the graphene skeleton. This approach enables resulting graphene aerogel to achieve a strength per unit volume of 284.6 cm3 mg−1, the ability to recover its shape within 10 ms after an impact at 3.569 m/s, and maintain 97.2 % of its sample height after 20,000 cycles at 90 % strain. The operand analyses and calculation results reveal that the MHM structure facilitates this aerogel's dual-stage stress transfer pathway. Initially, the macroscale honeycomb structure (millimeter-scale) of the graphene aerogels bear and transmit stress to the surrounding regions, followed by the microscale honeycomb structure (micron-scale) deformation to convert stress kinetic energy into elastic potential energy. This two-stage stress transition mechanism of the MHM structure can effectively mitigate excessive local stress and suppress strain localization, thus providing remarkable elasticity and durability. Ultimately, the obtained graphene aerogel demonstrates promising applications as a fall height detection device and impact protective material. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","","Aerogels; Elasticity; Graphene; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Potential energy; Calculation results; Graphene aerogels; Impact protection; Material density; Micro-structural; Multi-scales; Per unit volume; Protection material; Superelasticity; Ultra-light; Durability; graphene; graphene aerogel; graphene oxide; macrogol; aerogel; Article; biomimetics; chemical bond; compression; controlled study; degree of freedom; elasticity; finite element analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; humidity; hydrogen bond; hydrolysis; multiscale honeycomb microstructure; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pore size; reaction analysis; reaction time; scanning electron microscopy; structural model; structure analysis; article; kinetics; nonhuman; respiratory gas humidifier","Araromi, Oluwaseun A., Ultra-sensitive and resilient compliant strain gauges for soft machines, Nature, 587, 7833, pp. 219-224, (2020); Zhang, Xiaoyu, Bioinspired Gradient Stretchable Aerogels for Ultrabroad-Range-Response Pressure-Sensitive Wearable Electronics and High-Efficient Separators, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 62, 1, (2023); Wang, Peilin, 3D Janus structure MXene/cellulose nanofibers/luffa aerogels with superb mechanical strength and high-efficiency desalination for solar-driven interfacial evaporation, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 645, pp. 306-318, (2023); Guo, Hele, Weaving Aerogels into 3D Ordered Hyperelastic Hybrid Carbon Assemblies, Advanced Materials, 35, 30, (2023); Wang, Wuyou, Self-Assembled Construction of Robust and Super Elastic Graphene Aerogel for High-Efficient Formaldehyde Removal and Multifunctional Application, Small, 19, 24, (2023); Liao, Daogui, A resilient and lightweight cellulose/graphene oxide/polymer-derived multifunctional carbon aerogel generated from Pickering emulsion toward a wearable pressure sensor, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 628, pp. 574-587, (2022); Guo, Jingran, Hypocrystalline ceramic aerogels for thermal insulation at extreme conditions, Nature, 606, 7916, pp. 909-916, (2022); Chen, Qian, Ultraprecise 3D Printed Graphene Aerogel Microlattices on Tape for Micro Sensors and E-Skin, Advanced Functional Materials, 33, 33, (2023); Cao, Xueyuan, 1D/2D Nanomaterials Synergistic, Compressible, and Response Rapidly 3D Graphene Aerogel for Piezoresistive Sensor, Advanced Functional Materials, 30, 35, (2020); Cao, Minghui, Wearable piezoresistive pressure sensors based on 3D graphene, Chemical Engineering Journal, 406, (2021)",""

The numerical modelling of the efficient HCHSS was developed for the core, front and back face plate using the C3D8R elements to determine the realistic failure behaviour for the honeycomb sandwich structure. The ConWep blast simulation loading was applied for the HCHSS. Advanced composite materials were used for the blast analysis of the HCHSS (carbon/epoxy, graphite/epoxy, woven basalt fibres/polypropylene and woven Kevlar fibres/polypropylene). The damage initiation and damage propagation based progressive damage modelling was developed and implemented in the VUMAT code for composite materials to determine the actual failure behaviour of the HCHSS. The face sheets used in this model were of a stainless-steel alloy AL-6XN. The sandwich structure was subjected to blast loads of 1, 2 and 3 kg of TNT and their performance was compared w.r.t both front and back-face deflection. The effectiveness of sandwich panels was further examined by altering the thickness of the core. Fibre-metal laminates (FML) were used in place of the steel face sheets in the panel in order to minimise its mass, and a thorough analysis of the panel’s mass in relation to its peak deflection was carried out. Upon analysing the results, it was noted that the panel with the basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) core gave the best results compared to other composite materials. For a blast load of 3 kg TNT, the peak back face deflection (PBFD) of HCHSS with a BFRP core decreased by 10.64%, 7.61% and 4.75%, respectively, compared to panels with CFRP, GFRP, and KFRP cores. The peak deflection of the panel decreased as the BFRP core thickness increased. The energy absorption capacity of the panel also increased with increasing thickness. Additionally, it was found that panels with BFRP cores and KFRP-steel laminate face sheets provided the optimum balance of strong blast resistant performance and light weight. Compared to the metallic (steel) sandwich panel, the mass of the sandwich panel with KFRP-steel laminate face sheets and BFRP core was reduced by 33%, but at the same time, its PBFD increased by almost 50%. © IMechE 2024.","Blast load; composites; core optimisation; fibre-metal laminates; finite element modelling; sandwich panel; TNT","ABAQUS; Alloy steel; Basalt; Blast resistance; Composite beams and girders; Deflection (structures); Dynamic loads; Fatigue testing; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Forecasting; Glass ceramics; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Laminated composites; Plates (structural components); Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Blast loads; Core optimization; Element models; Fibre Metal Laminates; Finite element modeling; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Optimisations; Sandwich panel; TNT; Steel fibers","Theobald, M.

Hollow steel tubes are commonly used to produce bollards; however, their impact resistance and energy absorption are limited. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of honeycomb and auxetic cellular cores can improve the energy absorption and protection level of existing bollards. Hollow bollard, a honeycomb–core bollard and an auxetic-core bollard were numerically modeled and tested (using Simulia Abaqus software, version 2019) against the impact of M1-class vehicles (of 1500 kg mass) at five different speeds (following PAS 68:2013 British standard). Hence, 15 cases/numerical models were considered, with 5 cases for each bollard type. The results revealed that the addition of an auxetic cellular core to the bollard system could increase its energy dissipation by 52% compared to the hollow steel bollard. Moreover, the proposed auxetic anti-ram bollard system was capable of stopping an M1-class vehicular impact of 64 km/h compared to only 32 km/h when using a hollow steel bollard. To the authors’ knowledge, the use of an auxetic core, explicitly for anti-ram bollards, can be considered the novel part of this research. © 2024 by the authors.","Abaqus; anti-ram bollard; finite element model; honeycomb; impact; protective structures; re-entrant auxetic; structural dynamics","Concretes; Highway accidents; Honeycomb structures; Pedestrian safety; Pressure vessels; Tubular steel structures; Abaqus; Anti-ram bollard; Auxetics; Cellulars; Finite element modelling (FEM); Hollow steel; Honeycomb; Impact; Protective structures; Re-entrant auxetic; ABAQUS","Road Traffic Injuries, (2025); Ahmed, Sirwan Khalid, Road traffic accidental injuries and deaths: A neglected global health issue, Health Science Reports, 6, 5, (2023); Hu, Bo, Numerical investigation of K4-rating shallow footing fixed anti-ram bollard system subjected to vehicle impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 63, pp. 72-87, (2014); Impact and Energy Absorption of Straight and Tapered Rectangular Tubes, (2005); Maduliat, Soheila, Performance of hollow steel tube bollards under quasi-static and lateral impact load, Thin-Walled Structures, 88, pp. 41-47, (2015); Maduliat, Soheila, Energy absorption of steel hollow tubes under bending, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Structures and Buildings, 168, 12, pp. 930-942, (2015); Security and Resiliencevehicle Security Barriers Part 1 Performance Requirement Vehicle Impact Test Method and Performance Rating, (2023); Impact Test Specifications for Vehicle Security Barrier Systems, (2013); ASTM F2656m 20 Standard Test Method for Crash Testing of Vehicle Security Barriers, (2020); Al-Rifaie, Hasan, A new blast absorbing sandwich panel with unconnected corrugated layers—numerical study, Energies, 14, 1, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

This absorber improves energy absorption and impact resistance. This research compares the novel absorber to a conventional polymer-integrated model, by examining impact force, von-Mises stress, equivalent plastic strain, energy absorption, and coefficient of restitution. Utilizing the finite element method, the effects of shell density and thickness are analysed under E.C.E-R042 low-velocity impact standards. Sandwich absorbers exhibit lower stresses and plastic strains in the core. In addition, they demonstrate smaller impact forces and enhanced energy absorption within a specific range of shell densities. Furthermore, the absorber’s flexibility strongly influences contact time. The core of sandwich absorber models accounts for between 70 and 90% of energy absorption, indicating slightly lower energy absorption than polymer foams. The simulation results are analysed using analysis of variance to investigate the combined effect of the density and thickness of the sandwich absorber shell on the efficiency of the sandwich absorber.

The optimization of auxetic structures’ geometrical parameters can improve their performance. This research aims to optimize the design of an auxetic structure for maximum specific energy absorption and investigate its behavior under quasi-static compressive and high-velocity impact loading. The geometrical parameters of the cross-petal auxetic structure are optimized using genetic algorithm and a neural network surrogate model. The behavior of the optimized auxetic structure is examined in quasi-static compressive loading and compared with that of the basic auxetic structure using finite element simulations. The optimized auxetic structure is then evaluated in high-velocity impact loading as the core of a sandwich panel, with two plates placed in the front and rear. Simulations of projectile impacts at velocities ranging from 100 to 250 m/s reveal the sandwich panel’s behavior. Results indicate a 69.82% increase in specific energy absorption capacity for the optimized auxetic structure as compared to the basic structure in quasi-static compressive loading. In high-velocity impact, the sandwich panel with the optimal auxetic core outperforms the one with the basic core.

Four impact tests with varying energies are performed to induce four distinct damage states in the sandwich structure: no discernible damage, damage to the top face sheet and a portion of the core, damage to the lower face sheet, and total penetration. The damage characteristics of the sandwich structures is analyzed by using industrial tomography technology (CT) without destroying them. A refined finite element model is established to further explain the deformation behavior and energy absorption mechanism of the structure, clarifying the effects of the honeycomb core's structural parameters, such as wall thickness, cell side length, and core height. To enhance the precision of simulation outcomes, a model for the onset and progression of damage in plain woven composites is incorporated into the user-defined material subroutine. The experiments and simulations demonstrate a high level of consistency in terms of peak loads, failure mode, and energy absorption. © 2024","Composite honeycomb; Energy absorption; Finite element simulation; Low-velocity impact; Sandwich structure","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Computerized tomography; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite; Carbon fibre composites; Composite honeycomb; Face sheets; Finite elements simulation; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact failures; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Sandwich structures","Fan, Hualin, Compression and bending performances of carbon fiber reinforced lattice-core sandwich composites, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 52, pp. 118-125, (2013); Liu, Jialin, The edgewise compressive behavior and failure mechanism of the composite Y-frame core sandwich column, Polymer Testing, 81, (2020); Xie, Suchao, Sound absorption performance of a filled honeycomb composite structure, Applied Acoustics, 162, (2020); Tao, Qiangqiang, Energy absorption and impact behavior of composite sandwich panels under high-velocity spherical projectile, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 162, (2022); Huang, Yixing, Evolutionary optimization design of honeycomb metastructure with effective mechanical resistance and broadband microwave absorption, Carbon, 177, pp. 79-89, (2021); Qin, Qinghua, Dynamic response of square sandwich plates with a metal foam core subjected to low-velocity impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 111, pp. 222-235, (2018); Xiang, Chunping, Low-velocity impact response of sandwich beams with a metal foam core: Experimental and theoretical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 130, pp. 172-183, (2019); Russell, Benjamin P., The soft impact of composite sandwich beams with a square-honeycomb core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 48, pp. 65-81, (2012); Aryal, Binod, Effects of impact energy, velocity, and impactor mass on the damage induced in composite laminates and sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 226, (2019); Li, Quanwei, Numerical analysis of low-speed impact response of sandwich panels with bio-inspired diagonal-enhanced square honeycomb core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 173, (2023)",""

Different honeycomb wall thicknesses led to varying deformation behavior and impact deceleration, complicating effective energy absorption assessment. Stepped honeycomb wall designs aimed to balance compression, extending energy absorption and reducing deceleration peaks. Prototype honeycomb buffering devices showed improved energy absorption and reduced deceleration during gas-gun tests.

With the help of LS-DYNA finite element analysis software, the dynamic response of the sandwich panel to a cylindrical impact is simulated numerically. The influence of polyurea coating by the method of outline volume analysis position on its anti-impact is first analyzed. On this basis, the effects of impact velocity, impact angle of the cylinder, coating thickness, and coating area of polyurea elastomer on the sandwich panel are further discussed by the method of outline volume analysis. Finally, the polyurea thickness on both sides of the coated polyurea sandwich panel (type C) on both sides is optimized. The results show that the coating of polyurea elastomer can effectively enhance the impact protection performance of sandwich panels. By comparison with sandwich panel of uncoated structure (Type O), type C achieves the best anti-impact, and the maximum post deflection (D<inf>efl</inf>) is reduced by 61.6%. The increase in impact velocity and the decrease in impact angle will increase the maximum deflection of the sandwich panel if other variables remain constant. When the cylinder impact speed is certain, preference is given to sandwich panels that are thicker, larger, and have polyurea sprayed on both sides. The optimization by the response surface method shows that the sandwich panel with the best anti-impact may be obtained when the polyurea thickness ratio of the impact side to the back side is 1.3:0.7. © ASM International 2023.","anti-impact; numerical simulation; polyurea elastomer; response surface methodology; unidirectional graded auxetic honeycomb","Coatings; Cylinders (shapes); Honeycomb structures; Plastics; Sandwich structures; Surface properties; Thickness measurement; Anti impacts; Auxetics; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact velocities; Polyurea elastomer; Polyureas; Response-surface methodology; Sandwich panel; Unidirectional graded auxetic honeycomb; Volume analysis; Elastomers","Wowk, Diane D., An experimental and numerical investigation of core damage size in honeycomb sandwich panels subject to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 254, (2020); Xia, Ye, Protective effect of graded density aluminium foam on RC slab under blast loading-An experimental study, Construction and Building Materials, 111, pp. 209-222, (2016); Schneider, C., Impact response of ductile self-reinforced composite corrugated sandwich beams, Composites Part B: Engineering, 99, pp. 121-131, (2016); Dai, Xiangjun, Experimental investigation on the response and residual compressive property of honeycomb sandwich structures under single and repeated low velocity impacts, Materials Today Communications, 25, (2020); An isotropic three-dimensional structure with Poisson's ratio =-1, Journal of Elasticity, 15, 4, pp. 427-430, (1985); Ju, Jaehyung, Compliant hexagonal periodic lattice structures having both high shear strength and high shear strain, Materials and Design, 32, 2, pp. 512-524, (2011); Qi, Chang, Impact and close-in blast response of auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels: Experimental tests and numerical simulations, Composite Structures, 180, pp. 161-178, (2017); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018); Özen, İsmail, Low-energy impact response of composite sandwich panels with thermoplastic honeycomb and reentrant cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 156, (2020); Lan, Xuke, A comparative study of blast resistance of cylindrical sandwich panels with aluminum foam and auxetic honeycomb cores, Aerospace Science and Technology, 87, pp. 37-47, (2019)",""

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the buckling and vibration properties of these materials under heat circumstances. This paper specifically focuses on the vibration and thermal buckling characteristics of a novel multi-arc concave honeycomb sandwich plate (MACHSP) equipped with an adjustable positive-negative Poisson's ratio. The governing equations of motion for the system are derived based on the first-order shear deformation theory in conjunction with Hamilton's principle. The formulation of the system's characteristic equation involves the establishment of displacement functions that satisfy distinct boundary conditions. Using computational programming, natural frequencies, mode shapes, and critical buckling temperatures of MACHSP with three different FG-GPLRC distributions under thermal influences are determined. Subsequently, these results are compared with outcomes from finite element simulations and findings from previously published literature. Additionally, the amplitude-frequency response characteristics of the structure under harmonic excitation are analyzed, followed by a discussion of the impact of structural parameters on its buckling and vibration characteristics. The results indicate that the established theoretical model for predicting the buckling and vibration characteristics of MACHSP with FG-GPLRC distribution aligns well with simulation models and prior research. In contrast to solid plates, MACHSP not only achieves a substantial reduction in weight but also demonstrates a significant increase in natural frequency. Furthermore, graphene platelets have the potential to enhance the structure's natural frequency values and critical buckling temperatures. Lastly, various structural parameters exert a notable influence on the structure's performance. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.","critical buckling temperature; FG-GPLRC; multi-arc concave honeycomb; thermal environment; vibration","Buckling; Computation theory; Equations of motion; Frequency response; Graphene; Honeycomb structures; Platelets; Plates (structural components); Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Vibration analysis; Buckling temperature; Critical buckling temperature; Functionally graded; Functionally graded graphene platelet-reinforced composite; Graphene platelets; Multi arcs; Multi-arc concave honeycomb; Reinforced composites; Thermal environment; Vibration; Natural frequencies","Liu, Dingyuan, Bending theory of Vierendeel Sandwich Plate based on variational method, Composite Structures, 306, (2023); Chu, Changyong, A nonlinear Chebyshev-based collocation technique to frequency analysis of thermally pre/post-buckled third-order circular sandwich plates, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 118, (2023); Wattanasakulpong, Nuttawit, Transient Responses of Sandwich Plates with a Functionally Graded Porous Core: Jacobi-Ritz Method, International Journal of Structural Stability and Dynamics, 23, 4, (2023); Guo, Zhixi, MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF MULTI-ARC CONCAVE HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE WITH ADJUSTABLE POISSON'S RATIO, Gongcheng Lixue/Engineering Mechanics, 40, 10, pp. 204-236, (2023); Chen, Yuxin, Analysis of vibration and sound insulation characteristics of functionally graded sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 249, (2020); Li, Fenglian, Vibro-acoustic characteristics of sigmoid functionally graded sandwich plates with temperature-dependent materials, Thin-Walled Structures, 159, (2021); Tran, Loc V., Isogeometric analysis of functionally graded plates using higher-order shear deformation theory, Composites Part B: Engineering, 51, pp. 368-383, (2013); Yang, Jincheng, Innovative flexural strengthening of RC beams using self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates: Experimental and numerical investigations, Engineering Structures, 243, (2021); Yang, Shaowu, Buckling and free vibration of eccentric rotating CFRP cylindrical shell base on FSDT, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 95, pp. 593-611, (2021); Golmakani, M.

These beams feature two types of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) facings: one with a bio-resin matrix and the other with a partial bio-resin matrix. The core of the beams is a focal point of the study as well, comprised of recycled PET (R-PET). Fifteen different types of sandwich beams were tested, with three identical specimens from each type, totaling 45 beams. Each beam, measuring 240 mm in length, was fabricated and categorized based on its core composition: either an R-PET honeycomb or an R-PET foam core. The study investigated key parameters including the core type (honeycomb or foam), core thickness (12 mm or 15 mm), core orientation, and facing thicknesses (1 mm or 2 mm). The mechanical testing of these beams involved a four-point bending setup to assess their flexural performance. This included analyzing mid-span load–deflection, moment–curvature behaviours, and changes in tension and compression strains in the facings during bending. The results demonstrated that core density, type, and facing thickness significantly impact the beams’ stability and failure modes. High-density foam cores primarily failed through core shear, while lower density cores showed both core shear and wrinkling, dependent on facing thickness and core type, highlighting the complex influence of material properties on structural behaviour. A finite element (FE) model was developed to verify the experimental findings, effectively corroborating the test results. The research data is intended as a reference for structural designers seeking to incorporate sustainable alternatives into traditional building materials, thereby promoting a more environmentally conscious approach within the construction industry. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Foam; Honeycomb; PET, FRP; Recycled Plastic; Sustainability","Construction industry; Ductile fracture; Fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Mechanical testing; Plastic bottles; Plastic recycling; Polyethylene terephthalates; Resins; Sandwich structures; Fiber-reinforced polymers; Fibre reinforced polymers; Foam core; Honeycomb; Polyethylene terephthalate fibers; Polyethylene terephthalate, fiber-reinforced polymer; Recycled plastics; Recycled polyethylene terephthalates; Resin matrix; Sandwich beams; Facings","Huang, Beijia, A Life Cycle Thinking Framework to Mitigate the Environmental Impact of Building Materials, One Earth, 3, 5, pp. 564-573, (2020); Zabalza Bribián, Ignacio, Life cycle assessment of building materials: Comparative analysis of energy and environmental impacts and evaluation of the eco-efficiency improvement potential, Building and Environment, 46, 5, pp. 1133-1140, (2011); Ahmed, Noha, Impact of sustainable design in the construction sector on climate change, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 12, 2, pp. 1375-1383, (2021); Manjunatha, M., Life cycle assessment (LCA) of concrete prepared with sustainable cement-based materials, Materials Today: Proceedings, 47, pp. 3637-3644, (2021); Arıoğlu Akan, Mahmure Övül, Greenhouse gas emissions in the construction industry: An analysis and evaluation of a concrete supply chain, Journal of Cleaner Production, 167, pp. 1195-1207, (2017); Fufa, Selamawit Mamo, Assessment of greenhouse gas emissions of ventilated timber wall constructions based on parametric LCA, Journal of Cleaner Production, 197, pp. 34-46, (2018); Zeitz, A., Comparing the embodied carbon and energy of a mass timber structure system to typical steel and concrete alternatives for parking garages, Energy and Buildings, 199, pp. 126-133, (2019); Hart, Jim, Whole-life embodied carbon in multistory buildings: Steel, concrete and timber structures, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 25, 2, pp. 403-418, (2021); Kueh, Ahmad Beng Hong, Impact resistance efficiency of bio-inspired sandwich beam with different arched core materials, Steel and Composite Structures, 44, 1, pp. 105-117, (2022); Kueh, Ahmad Beng Hong, Repeated impact response of bio-inspired sandwich beam with arched and honeycomb bilayer core, Structural Engineering and Mechanics, 85, 6, pp. 755-764, (2023)",""

Nevertheless, the direct correlation among stress distributions in sandwiches, external loads, and ambient environments remains unclear. This study develops an analytical predictive model capable of efficiently capturing the mechanical response of LCSPs under various temperatures. The equivalent elastic modulus of lattice cores with different unit-cell aspect ratios is first determined according to finite element (FE) results. Subsequently, the thermo-mechanical field of the homogenized sandwich in various ambient temperatures is analytically predicted based on the higher-order shear deformation theory. Finally, truss stresses within lattice cores are directly calculated using an effective displacement transition method. The prediction exhibits outstanding consistency with FE simulations. Furthermore, the impact of several key variables on the truss stress distribution is demonstrated based on parametric analysis. The results reveal that the vertical truss is the main object of bearing the major uniaxial compressive load within the body-centered cubic (BCCZ) and vertically reinforced face-centered cubic (F2CCZ) lattice cores. The increased transverse layer number/power index and/or the smaller length-to-thickness ratio contribute to a significant reduction in inclined/vertical truss stresses. In contrast, the elevated longitudinal layer number, ambient temperature, and thermal expansion of face sheets result in stress accumulation. Furthermore, the stress distributions in BCCZ LCSPs are commonly higher than those within F2CCZ LCSPs. These results can provide a useful path for the design and fabrication of additively manufactured sandwich panels with desired mechanical properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Homogenization; Lattice-core sandwich; Thermal environment; Truss stress","Additives; Aspect ratio; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Stress concentration; Temperature; Thermal expansion; Trusses; External loads; Homogenization; Lattice-core sandwich; Layer number; Multifunctionality; Sandwich panel; Stress prediction; Stresses distribution; Thermal environment; Truss stress; 3D printing","Zhang, Hongzhuang, Effect of inclusion interface evolution on the thermal stability of cellular substructures in additively manufactured stainless steel, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 841, (2022); Zhang, Hongzhuang, Microstructure, surface quality, residual stress, fatigue behavior and damage mechanisms of selective laser melted 304L stainless steel considering building direction, Additive Manufacturing, 46, (2021); Wu, Jianqin, Meta-honeycomb sandwich tubes: Designing, manufacturing, and crashworthiness performance, Composites Science and Technology, 240, (2023); Hao, Jian, A novel compression-torsion coupling metamaterial with tunable Poisson's ratio, Construction and Building Materials, 395, (2023); Bayat, Mohamad, A fundamental investigation of thermo-capillarity in laser powder bed fusion of metals and alloys, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 166, (2021); Sun, Shanyouming You Ming, Forced convection in additively manufactured sandwich-walled cylinders with thermo-mechanical multifunctionality, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 149, (2020); Wu, Peng, Holistic evaluation of limited voltage windows paired with artificial solid-electrolyte interphase under lean electrolyte conditions of Li[sbnd]S batteries, Journal of Energy Storage, 71, (2023); Zhang, Jingwei, Bending properties of sandwich sheets with metallic face sheets and additively manufactured 3D CFRP lattice cores, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 300, (2022); Bühring, Jannik, Additive manufactured sandwich structures: Mechanical characterization and usage potential in small aircraft, Aerospace Science and Technology, 111, (2021); Pierre, Juliette, Material extrusion additive manufacturing of multifunctional sandwich panels with load-bearing and acoustic capabilities for aerospace applications, Additive Manufacturing, 61, (2023)",""

The Hashin damage model was employed to describe the damage evolution of the composite materials. The simulation results revealed that the dynamic response was significantly influenced by the initial shock wave pressure and the geometrical parameters of the honeycomb cells. Larger cell-edge lengths and heights generally resulted in improved energy absorption and reduced rear panel displacement.

The theoretical model in this article is a simplified model and cannot consider details such as damage, debonding, and the influence of layer angles in experiments. It is necessary to establish a refined theoretical model that can consider the microstructure and failure of composite materials in the future. © 2024 by the authors.","dynamic response; FML; metal foam; sandwich beam","Beams and girders; Concretes; Debonding; Dynamic response; Honeycomb structures; Laminated composites; Metal foams; Mortar; Pressure vessels; Reinforced plastics; Rigid foamed plastics; Sandwich structures; Structural dynamics; Blast loading; Composites material; Fibre Metal Laminates; Foam core; Material layers; Sandwich beams; Strength factor; Structural response; Theoretical modeling; ABAQUS","Soutis, C., Fibre reinforced composites in aircraft construction, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 41, 2, pp. 143-151, (2005); Ding, Zerong, A review on forming technologies of fibre metal laminates, International Journal of Lightweight Materials and Manufacture, 4, 1, pp. 110-126, (2021); Khalid, Muhammad Yasir, Effect of Anodizing Process on Inter Laminar Shear Strength of GLARE Composite through T-Peel Test: Experimental and Numerical Approach, Experimental Techniques, 45, 2, pp. 227-235, (2021); Annamalai, Ilavarasapandi, Experimental investigation of mechanical properties of GLARE composite with different layup sequences, Materials Today: Proceedings, 46, pp. 1371-1375, (2021); Kali, Naresh, Influence of Nanoparticles on Mechanical Properties of Hybrid Polymer-Layered Fibre Metal Laminates (FMLs), Transactions of the Indian Institute of Metals, 75, 8, pp. 1979-1988, (2022); Xie, Min, Classification of fiber metal laminates (FMLs), adhesion theories and methods for improving interfacial adhesion: A review, Thin-Walled Structures, 198, (2024); Jakubczak, Patryk Adam, The assessment of the compressive strength of fibre metal laminates after low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 320, (2023); Germano Braga, Guilherme Germano, Life cycle assessment of fibre metal laminates: An ecodesign approach, Composites Part C: Open Access, 13, (2024); Zhang, Jianxun, On axial splitting and curling behaviour of circular sandwich metal tubes with metal foam core, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 202, pp. 111-125, (2020); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Compared with existing experimental data, the validity of the finite element modeling method was verified. Parameter analysis was conducted on 36 full-scale STHHCs to obtain the hysteresis curve of the composite columns and to clarify the impact of the different parameters on the skeleton curve, the energy dissipation capacity, the stiffness degradation, and the ductility of the composite columns. The results showed that the hysteresis curves of all specimens after freeze-thaw cycles exhibited an ideal shuttle shape, reflecting that this kind of composite column has good energy dissipation ability and freeze-thaw resistance. The specimens’ maximum bulging deformation and maximum stress both occurred at the column base. Finally, the restoring force model of this kind of composite column is therefore established, and design recommendations based on these results are proposed. © 2024 by the authors.","composite columns with high-strength concrete-filled steel tube flanges and honeycomb steel web; finite element analysis; freeze-thaw cycles; restoring force model; seismic performance","Columns (structural); Composite structures; Concretes; Honeycomb structures; Seismic response; Tubular steel structures; Composite column; Composite column with high-strength concrete-filled steel tube flange and honeycomb steel web; Concretefilled steel tubes (CFST); Finite element analyse; Freeze-thaw cycles; High strength concretes; Restoring force models; Seismic behaviour; Seismic Performance; Steel webs; Thawing","Cao, Wanlin, Seismic Behavior of Prefabricated Lightweight Steel Frame-light Steel Keel-lightweight Concrete Shear Wall Structure, Beijing Gongye Daxue Xuebao / Journal of Beijing University of Technology, 50, 2, pp. 165-179, (2024); Ji, Jing, Experimental Study of H-Shaped Honeycombed Stub Columns with Rectangular Concrete-Filled Steel Tube Flanges Subjected to Axial Load, Advances in Civil Engineering, 2021, (2021); J Guangxi Univ Nat Sci Ed, (2017); Zhang, Tong, Prediction and analysis of the residual capacity of concrete-filled steel tube stub columns under axial compression subjected to combined freeze-thaw cycles and acid rain corrosion, Materials, 12, 19, (2019); Ji, Jing, Axial compression behavior of strength-gradient composite stub columns encased CFST with small diameter: Experimental and numerical investigation, Structures, 47, pp. 282-298, (2023); Shen, Xiaosheng, Experimental research on axial compression behavior of circular CFST short columns after freeze-thaw cycles, Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao/Journal of Building Structures, 40, 5, pp. 105-114, (2019); Ji, Jing, Structural application of engineered cementitious composites (ECC): A state-of-the-art review, Construction and Building Materials, 406, (2023); Gao, Shan, Compressive behavior of circular concrete-filled steel tubular columns under freeze-thaw cycles, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 166, (2020); Li, Xinger, Experimental study on interfacial bonding properties of circular steel tube concrete columns after freeze-thaw cycles, Tumu yu Huanjing Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 45, 4, pp. 114-123, (2023); Ji, Jing, Bearing Behavior of H-Shaped Honeycombed Steel Web Composite Columns with Rectangular Concrete-Filled Steel Tube Flanges under Eccentrical Compression Load, Advances in Civil Engineering, 2022, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Attention has been paid to CFRP structures in order to accurately simulate their progressive failure behavior and discuss their ply designability. In this study, the preparation process of a CFRP corrugated sheet (half of the honeycomb structure) and a CFRP honeycomb structure was illustrated. The developed finite element method was verified by a quasi-static test, which was then used to predict the low-velocity impact (LVI) behavior of the CFRP honeycomb, and ultimately, the influence of the ply angle and number on energy absorption was discussed. The results show that the developed finite element method (including the user-defined material subroutine VUMAT) can reproduce the progressive failure behavior of the CFRP corrugated sheet under quasi-static compression and also estimate the LVI behavior. The angle and number of plies of the honeycomb structure have an obvious influence on their energy absorption under LVI. Among them, energy absorption increases with the ply number, but the specific energy absorption is basically constant. The velocity drop ratios for the five different ply angles are 79.12%, 68.49%, 66.88%, 66.86%, and 60.02%, respectively. Therefore, the honeycomb structure with [0/90]s ply angle had the best energy absorption effect. The model proposed in this paper has the potential to significantly reduce experimental expenses, while the research findings can provide valuable technical support for design optimization in aerospace vehicle structures. © 2024 by the authors.","carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP); cushioning energy absorption; finite element simulation; honeycomb structure; low-velocity impact (LVI); progressive failure","Corrugated containers; Corrugated paperboard; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Structural dynamics; Subroutines; Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Cushioning energy absorption; Energy; Failure behaviors; Finite elements simulation; Low velocity impact; Low-velocity impact; Ply angles; Progressive failure; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","Dou, Hao, Research on drop-weight impact of continuous carbon fiber reinforced 3D printed honeycomb structure, Materials Today Communications, 29, (2021); Muthukumar, Chandrasekar, Low velocity impact properties of natural fiber-reinforced composite materials for aeronautical applications, pp. 293-313, (2018); Deng, Jian, A comprehensive analysis of damage behaviors of composite sandwich structures under localized impact, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 16, pp. 3231-3244, (2023); Tang, Enling, Characterization of dynamic compressive strength and impact release energy of Al/PTFE energetic materials reinforced by aluminum honeycomb skeleton, Composite Structures, 241, (2020); Mohamadi, Yousef, Axial crushing responses of aluminum honeycomb structures filled with elastomeric polyurethane foam, Thin-Walled Structures, 164, (2021); Foo, Choon Chiang, Mechanical properties of Nomex material and Nomex honeycomb structure, Composite Structures, 80, 4, pp. 588-594, (2007); Liu, Longquan, Impact resistance of Nomex honeycomb sandwich structures with thin fibre reinforced polymer facesheets, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 20, 5, pp. 531-552, (2018); Fan, Jinbo, Experimental Investigation on the Low-Velocity Impact Response of Tandem Nomex Honeycomb Sandwich Panels, Polymers, 15, 2, (2023); Gilat, Amos, Experimental study of strain-rate-dependent behavior of carbon/epoxy composite, Composites Science and Technology, 62, 10-11, pp. 1469-1476, (2002); Pinho, Silvestre T., Fracture toughness of the tensile and compressive fibre failure modes in laminated composites, Composites Science and Technology, 66, 13, pp. 2069-2079, (2006)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access"

The high-order shear deformation theory and Bernoulli’s equation for the structure-fluid interface were used. To solve the equations obtained and validate the results, the Galerkin method and Abaqus finite element software were employed. The main innovation of this research is the calculation of the effective mass of the top layer and the entire sandwich cylindrical shell containing fluid using displacement field relations, their equivalent density, and indentation force due to impact. In addition, to calculate the impact force and the structure-fluid interaction, a two-degree-of-freedom model of mass, spring, and damper with the effect of the crushing resistance of the core was used. The results show that the fluid is an important and effective factor in calculating the natural frequency and low-velocity impact on the structure. The presence of fluid reduces the fundamental natural frequency of the sandwich cylindrical shell by 69%. Parameters such as core and layer thickness, length, and radius of the sandwich cylindrical shell, presence of the fluid, various boundary conditions, wave number, fiber orientation angles, velocity, and mass of the impactor are essential and influential factors in studying vibrations, impact, and optimal design of structures. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","fluid; Galerkin method; high-order shear deformation theory; low-velocity impact; sandwich cylindrical shell","ABAQUS; Cylinders (shapes); Fluid structure interaction; Honeycomb structures; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Vibration analysis; Abaqus finite element software; Bernoulli; Fluid interface; Free vibration; High-order shear deformation theory; Higher order shear deformation theory; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Sandwich cylindrical shells; Vibration velocity; Shells (structures)","Sharma, C.

To that scope, the progressive damage model with the sandwich panel is developed and numerical investigations are carried out in ABAQUS / Explicit. The results show that as the impactor changes from flat to hemispherical and then to conical shape, the first peak load gradually decreases, and the maximum displacement of the impactor and total energy absorption gradually increase. The high impact energy makes the sandwich panel more compliant. Furthermore, the expansion area of fiber damage, matrix damage and delamination in the top face sheet, core and bottom face sheet depends on the impactor shape and impact energy. Under high impact energy, the damage under the conical impactor mainly expands along the thickness direction of the sandwich panel rather than in the in-plane direction, while the flat impactor causes large damage area in the in-plane direction as well. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Finite element analysis; Impactor shape; Low-velocity impact; The orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel","Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Face sheets; Finite element analyse; High impact energy; Impactor shape; Impactors; In-plane direction; Low velocity impact; Progressive damage; Sandwich panel; The orthogonal corrugated sandwich panel; Finite element method","Sun, Guangyong, Experimental study on the dynamic responses of foam sandwich panels with different facesheets and core gradients subjected to blast impulse, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 135, (2020); Guo, Kailing, Dynamic responses of metal foam sandwich beam under repeated impacts considering impact location and face thickness distribution, Composites Part C: Open Access, 11, (2023); Zhou, Xiongfei, Low-velocity impact response of sandwich panels with layered-gradient metal foam cores, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 184, (2024); Yu, Zhenhao, Low-velocity impact response of aluminum alloy corrugated sandwich beams used for high-speed trains, Thin-Walled Structures, 183, (2023); Cheng, Yuqin, Experimental and numerical simulation of dynamic response of U-type corrugated sandwich panels under low-velocity impact, Ocean Engineering, 245, (2022); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of sandwich plates with GLARE face-sheets and honeycomb core under metal foam projectile impact: Experimental and numerical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 164, (2022); Qin, Qinghua, On influence of face sheet distributions on low-velocity impact failure of metal honeycomb core sandwich plates, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Zhao, Tian, An experimental investigation on low-velocity impact response of a novel corrugated sandwiched composite structure, Composite Structures, 252, (2020); Chen, Hongji, Analysis and optimum design of composite grid structures, Journal of Composite Materials, 30, 4, pp. 503-534, (1996); Ding, Junliang, A review on ultra-high cycle fatigue of CFRP, Composite Structures, 256, (2021)",""

Various techniques have been employed to enhance the performance of energy absorbers, resulting in notable transformations such as the shift from asymmetric to symmetric collapse modes, increased energy absorption capacity, or reduced peak impact forces. In this novel study, the utilization of a burr-filled structure has been introduced as a means to increase the energy absorption capacity. The energy absorbers employed in this research comprised cylindrical bodies with a circular cross-section, which were filled with burr material of identical composition. The absorbers underwent testing at three distinct energy levels, namely 800, 1200, and 1600 Joules. The experimentation encompassed both unfilled samples and those filled with honeycomb structures, with four different mass configurations being considered for the burr fillers. The findings of the study demonstrate that increasing the mass of the burr filler within the absorber leads to a corresponding increase in energy absorption capacity. Specifically, the inclusion of a 40-g honeycomb burr-filler resulted in a notable 40% enhancement in energy absorption. However, the presence of the burr-filler had a minimal impact on the peak force. This is noteworthy as burr-filled structures are relatively lightweight and currently underutilized and waste materials, suggesting that the increased energy absorption achieved through their implementation can offer cost-effective solutions in industrial contexts. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the observed improvements in absorbed energy, identical experimental samples were also simulated using the finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit, yielding consistent outcomes. © Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc 2024.","ABAQUS/Explicit; Aluminum cylinder; Burr-filled; Energy absorber","Aluminum; Cost effectiveness; Cylinders (shapes); Energy absorption; Fillers; Honeycomb structures; Software reliability; Structural dynamics; ABAQUS/explicit; Aluminium cylinder; Automotives; Burr-filled; Collapse behavior; Energy absorbers; Energy absorption capacity; Impact protection; Low velocity impact; Performance; ABAQUS","Rezvani, Mohammad Javad, Experimental and numerical investigation of grooves shape on the energy absorption of 6061-T6 aluminium tubes under axial compression, International Journal of Materials and Structural Integrity, 6, 2-4, pp. 151-168, (2012); Zhang, Xiaowei, Energy absorption of an axially crushed square tube with a buckling initiator, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 3, pp. 402-417, (2009); Salehghaffari, Shahabedin, The collapse of thick-walled metal tubes with wide external grooves as controllable energy-dissipating devices, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science, 223, 11, pp. 2465-2480, (2009); Wang, Shilong, Energy-absorbing mechanism and crashworthiness performance of thin-walled tubes diagonally filled with rib-reinforced foam blocks under axial crushing, Composite Structures, 299, (2022); Adachi, Tadaharu, Energy absorption of a thin-walled cylinder with ribs subjected to axial impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 2, pp. 65-79, (2008); Zhang, Xiong, Energy absorption of longitudinally grooved square tubes under axial compression, Thin-Walled Structures, 47, 12, pp. 1469-1477, (2009); Razazan, M., Evaluation of the Performance of Initiator on Energy Absorption of Foam-Filled Rectangular Tubes: Experimental and Numerical Assessment, Experimental Techniques, 42, 2, pp. 129-139, (2018); Rezvani, Mohammad Javad, Effect of initiator, design, and material on crashworthiness performance of thin-walled cylindrical tubes: A primary multi-criteria analysis in lightweight design, Thin-Walled Structures, 96, pp. 169-182, (2015); Moreno, C., Testing, simulation and evaluation of a novel hybrid energy absorber, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 93, pp. 11-27, (2016); Meymand, Fatemeh Mahmoudi, The Collapse of Fully Hybrid and Sectionally Hybrid Cylindrical Energy Absorbers under Impact Loading: An Experimental and Simulation-based Investigation, Fibers and Polymers, 23, 13, pp. 3645-3654, (2022)",""

To assess the random vibration properties of a composite sandwich panel with a Tri-Chi honeycomb core (CSP-TCH), a two-dimensional equivalent Reissner–Mindlin model (2D-ERM) was created using the variational asymptotic method. The precision of the 2D-ERM in free and random vibration analysis was confirmed through numerical simulations employing 3D finite element analysis, encompassing PSD curves and RMS responses. Furthermore, the effects of selecting the model class were quantified through dynamic numerical examples. Modal analysis revealed that the relative error of the first eight natural frequencies predicted by the 2D-ERM consistently remained below 7%, with the modal cloud demonstrating high reliability. The PSD curves and their RMS values closely aligned with 3D finite element results under various boundary conditions, with a maximum error below 5%. Key factors influencing the vibration characteristics included the ligament–rib angle of the core layer and layup modes of the composite facesheets, while the rib-to-ligament thickness ratio and the aspect ratio exert minimal influence. The impact of the ligament–rib angle on the vibration properties primarily stems from the significant shift in the core layer’s Poisson’s ratio, transitioning from negative to positive. These findings offer a rapid and precise approach for optimizing the vibration design of CSP-TCH. © 2024 by the authors.","auxetic effect; random vibration characteristics; sandwich panel; triangular chiral honeycomb; variational asymptotic method","Asymptotic analysis; Chirality; Digital elevation model; Honeycomb structures; Modal analysis; Poisson ratio; Sandwich structures; Variational techniques; Vibration analysis; Auxetic effect; Auxetics; Composite sandwich panels; Random vibration characteristic; Random vibrations; Sandwich panel; Triangular chiral honeycomb; Two-dimensional; Variational asymptotic methods; Vibration characteristics; Aspect ratio","Li, Dong, Strong re-entrant cellular structures with negative Poisson’s ratio, Journal of Materials Science, 53, 5, pp. 3493-3499, (2018); Friis, E.

The finite element models of STHHC composite columns were simulated using ABAQUS finite element software (Version: 2021). The modeling method’s rationality was verified by comparing simulation results with experimental outcomes. Based on the finite element model, a parametric analysis of the composite columns under freeze–thaw cycles was conducted, analyzing their failure modes and load-bearing processes. The results indicate that the bearing capacity of the STHHC increased with increases in ξ and f<inf>cu</inf>, and decreased with a rise in λ. In contrast, the influence of s/h<inf>w</inf> and d/h<inf>w</inf> on the ultimate bearing capacity of the composite columns was relatively minor.

Impact tests were conducted across different energy levels on single-layer and tandem honeycomb-core sandwiches to observe their impact processes and failure behaviors. Our findings indicate that tandem honeycomb cores significantly enhance the impact resistance compared with single-layer configurations, even though a misaligned assembly can deteriorate this property. A finite element model was developed and validated experimentally; the model showed good agreement with the experiments, thereby allowing the simulation and evaluation of the impact responses. Herein, we reveal that specific misalignment lengths can either increase or decrease the impact resistance, providing insights into improving the resilience of tandem honeycomb-core structures.

Different structural features of basic units may lead to different mechanical characteristics in the whole part. In this study, a novel hexagonal cell body topology structure (NH) was designed and manufactured by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique to explore the effects on mechanical properties. The tensile and impact performance of the NH structure were compared with the regular hexagonal honeycomb structure (HH), and the influence of different unit single-cell sizes on the impact performance of the NH structure was investigated. The force transmission of the basic units of the NH structure was revealed through finite element analysis. The results indicate that both the tensile and impact performances of the NH structure have been improved compared to the HH structure. The improvement is due to the better force transmission capability of the basic units of the NH structure, leading to a more uniform stress distribution. Moreover, excessively large or small single-cell sizes of the NH structure will reduce the overall structure’s impact resistance. The overall structure achieves optimal impact resistance when the single-cell size is around 1.2 mm. © 2024 by the authors.","bio-inspired; fused deposition modeling; honeycomb topology; mechanical properties","Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Cells; Cytology; Deposition; Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Transmissions; Basic units; Bio-inspired; Cell bodies; Cell-size; Hexagonal cells; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb topology; Impact performance; Single cells; Tensile performance; Topology","Li, Shanshan, Iron fractions responsible for the variation of Cd bioavailability in paddy soil under variable pe+pH conditions, Chemosphere, 251, (2020); Xia, Hongxiang, Influence of strain rate effect on energy absorption characteristics of bio-inspired honeycomb column thin-walled structure under impact loading, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 18, (2023); Dai, Honghua, Post-capture vibration suppression of spacecraft via a bio-inspired isolation system, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 105, pp. 214-240, (2018); Wang, Xin, Vibration suppression for post-capture spacecraft via a novel bio-inspired Stewart isolation system, Acta Astronautica, 168, pp. 1-22, (2020); Mohammadi, Hossein, An insight from nature: Honeycomb pattern in advanced structural design for impact energy absorption, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 22, pp. 2862-2887, (2023); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Quan, Chao, 3d printed continuous fiber reinforced composite auxetic honeycomb structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 187, (2020); Son, Min A., Structural origin of negative thermal expansion of cordierite honeycomb ceramics and crystal phase evolution with sintering temperature, Journal of the European Ceramic Society, 39, 7, pp. 2484-2492, (2019); Tan, Xiaojun, Real-time tunable negative stiffness mechanical metamaterial, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 41, (2020)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Inspired by the arch bridge, new types of straight-arc coupled structure (SACS) and the reverse SACS (R-SACS) auxetic metamaterials are designed to enhance the energy absorption capacity (EAC). The quasi-static compression and dynamic impact responses of honeycomb metamaterials are studied numerically under large deformation. A theoretical model is further developed to estimate the average platform stress (σ<inf>p</inf>) of the R-SACS honeycomb, which is verified by the numerical results. For R-SACS--3 with Nylon 12 and Al-alloy, the relative errors of the finite element model compared with the theoretical model are − 5.56 % and − 3.21 %, respectively. Two kinds of basic materials, Nylon 12 and Al-alloy, are employed to analyze the deformation mode of the SACS and R-SACS honeycomb with the same geometric parameters under quasi-static load and impact load. The influence of basic material is discussed, and the structure with Al-alloy exhibits more stability owing to segmented deformation. The creation of additional plastic angles shows an improved σ<inf>p</inf> and specific energy absorption (SEA) compared to the re-entrant structure (RES). σ<inf>p</inf> and SEA of SACS are both 1.3 times as much as those of RES.

The numerical modal analysis was performed by the finite element method using ANSYS software to validate the experimental results.

Micro-cellular foams are composed of a large number of struts and walls with micro-scale radiation effect, making it difficult to analyze the influence of strut micro-structure on radiation properties. In this study, the radiation parameters of the curved triangular prism-shaped struts are calculated using the finite element electromagnetic method, and the influence of the strut micro-structure parameters and the macroscopic parameters of the foam on the radiation characteristics is analyzed. The results demonstrate that the radiation properties of the equal-volume cylinder model, compared to the double-layer cylinder model, are closer to those of the curved triangular prism struts.

It is difficult to ignore the radiation parameter deviation of concave-curved triangular prism-shaped struts.

Lithium-ion batteries, as the mainstream choice of power battery for electric vehicles solving the problem that they are prone to thermal runaway due to damage when impacted, are the key to preventing and controlling fire accidents in electric vehicles. To address the protective problem of the bottom power battery of electric vehicles when it is impacted by road debris, two new types of sandwich structures with an enhanced regular hexagonal structure and semicircular arch structure as the core layer, respectively, are innovatively proposed in this article. They are used to protect the bottom power battery of electric vehicles and are compared with the traditional homogeneous protective structure in terms of protective performance. A local finite element simulation (FEM) of an electric vehicle containing the necessary components was established for simulation. Stress distribution, deformation, and energy absorption data for each component of an electric vehicle assembled with a protective structure when subjected to a bottom impact were obtained safely and cost-effectively. Three evaluation coefficients, namely, the cell shape variable (B<inf>cmax</inf>), the protective effect parameter (ƒ<inf>PE</inf>), and the total energy absorption of the structure (E<inf>a</inf>), are proposed to compare and analyze the simulation results of different protective structures under equal mass conditions. The maximum values of the battery deformation of arched sandwich construction and reinforced honeycomb sandwich construction were 0.35 mm and 0.40 mm, respectively, which are much smaller than that of the maximum deformation of the battery under the protection of a homogeneous protective structure, which is 0.62 mm. Their protective effect parameters are 43.55 and 35.48, respectively, which proves that the optimization degree of the protective structure of the bottom of the electric vehicle after the application of the new structure is 35% or more. The total energy absorptions of the two structures are 91.77 J and 87.19 J, respectively, accounting for more than 70% of the kinetic energy in the system, which proves that the deformation of the sandwich structure can effectively absorb the kinetic energy of the collision between the road obstacle and the bottom of the car. The final results show that the arched sandwich structure showed the best impact resistance in the simulation, which can be used for the power battery’s protective structure on the electric vehicle’s bottom. This study fills a gap in local finite element modeling in electric vehicle crash simulations and provides ideas for fire prevention designs of electric vehicle structures. © 2024 by the authors.","battery; bottom crash; finite element analysis; fire prevention; protective structure","","Lv, Li, Production forecast of china’s new energy passenger vehicles in 2021–2023 under the compliance of dual-credit policy, World Electric Vehicle Journal, 12, 3, (2021); Tan, Qingbo, Development Path and Model Design of a New Energy Vehicle in China, Energies, 16, 1, (2023); Wang, Shengyuan, Exploring the Sustainability of China’s New Energy Vehicle Development: Fresh Evidence from Population Symbiosis, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 17, (2022); Zhang, Hao, Subsidy strategy on new-energy vehicle based on incomplete information: A Case in China, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 541, (2020); Kulkarni, Shank S., Investigation of Crashworthiness of Carbon Fiber-Based Electric Vehicle Battery Enclosure Using Finite Element Analysis, Applied Composite Materials, 30, 6, pp. 1689-1715, (2023); Li, Qiqi, Multi-objective optimization design of B-pillar and rocker sub-systems of battery electric vehicle, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 64, 6, pp. 3999-4023, (2021); Lian, Yufeng, Lateral Collision Avoidance Robust Control of Electric Vehicles Combining a Lane-Changing Model Based on Vehicle Edge Turning Trajectory and a Vehicle Semi-Uncertainty Dynamic Model, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 19, 2, pp. 331-343, (2018); Pan, Yongjun, Crush and crash analysis of an automotive battery-pack enclosure for lightweight design, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 2, pp. 500-509, (2022); Zhao, Junchao, Experimental study on thermal runaway behaviors of 18650 li-ion battery under enclosed and ventilated conditions, Fire Safety Journal, 125, (2021); Kong, Depeng, Effect of low temperature on thermal runaway and fire behaviors of 18650 lithium-ion battery: A comprehensive experimental study, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 174, pp. 448-459, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

It is designed for installation on traditional metal supports in coal mine roadways, serves as an integral element of an energy-absorption support system tailored to withstand rock burst impacts. The investigation incorporates drop hammer impact tests conducted on eight HSP specimens, varying in cell wall thickness and core height. A comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model, inclusive of mesh considerations, was constructed and subsequently validated. Combining experimental and numerical approaches, the drop hammer impact response and energy absorption characteristics of HSP structures were analyzed. The findings reveal good energy absorption capabilities, with HSPs dissipating over 90 % of impact energy, over 85 % attributed to the core layer. Thinner core cell walls reduce peak impact loads, mitigating structural impact effects. In the experimental parameters delineated in the present study, it is observed that core layers with thicknesses of 1.0 mm and 1.5 mm demonstrate enhanced energy absorption capabilities. Variations in core height minimally affect peak impact forces, with only a 7.41 % distinction between 60 mm and 140 mm core layers. However, it is worth noting that higher core layers can achieve an enhanced energy absorption capacity. Thinner facesheets enhance energy absorption, and alterations in impactor mass have minimal effects under constant impact energy conditions. Additionally, a predictive equation for estimating indentation depth was proposed, closely aligned with finite element results. This equation holds potential for informing future HSP designs, offering valuable insights for diverse engineering applications. © 2024 Institution of Structural Engineers","Drop hammer test; Energy absorption; Honeycomb sandwich panel; Impact, roadway","Coal; Coal mines; Drops; Hammers; Honeycomb structures; Rock bursts; Sandwich structures; Coal mine roadways; Core layers; Drop hammer test; Drop hammers; Energy absorption capability; Experimental and numerical studies; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact energy; Impact, roadway; Innovative solutions; Energy absorption","Li, Pin, Coal Supply Sustainability in China: A New Comprehensive Evaluation Methodology, Frontiers in Energy Research, 9, (2021); Ortlepp, William David, Rockburst mechanisms in tunnels and shafts, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 9, 1, pp. 59-65, (1994); Proceeding of the Rock Support in Mining and Underground Construction, (1992); Rockbursts Case Studies from North American Hard Rock Mines, (2003); Rockbursts and Seismicity in Mines, (1993); Rockburst Handbook for Ontario Hardrock Mines, (1992); Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr, (1989); Canadian Rockburst Support Handbook, (1996); Singh, Bhawani P., Rock Mass Classification.

Its complex cellular hexagonal thin-walled configuration along with heterogeneous, soft and brittle nature pose substantial processing defects such as burr formation, tearing of walls, surface roughness, dimensional inaccuracy and low machining quality during conventional machining (CM). These surface defects have a substantial influence on the operating life and functional performance of its sandwiched structural members. Hybrid ultrasonic vibration assisted machining (HUSVAM) technology has been introduced to overcome such limitations. For an in depth research on HUSVAM of NHC using ultrasonic toothed disc cutter (UTDC), three dimensional finite element model was developed and experimental validation was carried out. The numerical simulation and experimental results were found to be in good agreement with one another. The influence of various machining parameters including the ultrasonic tool vibration amplitude (UTVA), feed rate (FR), depth of cut (DoC) and spindle angular speed (SAS) on NHC cutting forces, chip formation and surface quality was investigated using both HUSVAM and CM techniques. Furthermore, stresses, deformation and forces near tool-workpiece interaction along with the surface topography and morphologies were also analysed and compared for various operating conditions. A reduction in the cutting forces was found with the increase of SAS and UTVA (up to 65.47 % and 65.74 %, respectively). Although, the cutting forces were observed to increase by increasing the DoC and FR (up to 159.45 % and 126.33 %, respectively). DoC has a greater impact on the cutting forces among all machining parameters according to 4 levels, 4 factors (L<inf>16</inf>) orthogonal experiments based on Taguchi method. The results show that the chip formation and machining quality of NHC core can be improved with HUSVAM technique using UTDC. HUSVAM also reduced the cutting forces (up to 73 %) compared to CM. The ultrasonic toothed disc cutter generated large number of burr with very short length, no tearing defects and no uncut fibers as observed from scanning electron microscopy of NHC hexagonal cell structure, walls and triple points. A burr formation of less than 10 % was realized during HUSVAM of NHC cores for F<inf>x</inf>≤3N, while it was found up to 20 % if F<inf>x</inf>>3N, compared to at least 40 % during CM. The finite element model developed can be used to investigate the influence of HUSVAM on modern difficult to machine materials for enhanced surface quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Cutting force; Finite element model; Hybrid ultrasonic vibration assisted machining (HUSVAM); Machining parameters; Nomex honeycomb composites (NHC); Surface quality; Ultrasonic toothed disc cutter (UTDC)","Cutting; Cutting tools; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Machining centers; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface roughness; Taguchi methods; Thin walled structures; Topography; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic effects; Ultrasonic waves; Cutting forces; Disc cutter; Finite element modelling (FEM); Honeycomb composite; Hybrid ultrasonic vibration assisted machining; Machining parameters; Nomex honeycomb composite; Nomex honeycombs; Ultrasonic toothed disk cutter; Ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining; Surface properties; animal tissue; article; cell structure; controlled study; finite element analysis; force; hybrid; nonhuman; radiology phantom; scanning electron microscopy; simulation; three dimensional finite element analysis; topography; ultrasound; velocity; vibration","Ahmad, Shahzad, Processing technologies for Nomex honeycomb composites (NHCs): A critical review, Composite Structures, 250, (2020); Xiang, Daohui, Ultrasonic Vibration Assisted Cutting of Nomex Honeycomb Core Materials, International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing, 20, 1, pp. 27-36, (2019); Kang, Di, Study on ultrasonic vibration–assisted cutting of Nomex honeycomb cores, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 104, 1-4, pp. 979-992, (2019); Cui, Ruoyu, A path planning method for v-shaped robotic cutting of nomex honeycomb by straight blade tool, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 162763-162774, (2020); Cao, Wenjun, Cutting force prediction and experiment verification of paper honeycomb materials by ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 13, (2020); Xu, Jie, Meso-scale cracks initiation of Nomex honeycomb composites in orthogonal cutting with a straight blade cutter, Composites Science and Technology, 233, (2023); Xiang, Daohui, Ultrasonic longitudinal-torsional vibration-assisted cutting of Nomex® honeycomb-core composites, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 100, 5-8, pp. 1521-1530, (2019); Ahmad, Shahzad, Experimental study on rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) characteristics of Nomex honeycomb composites (NHCs) by circular knife cutting tools, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 58, pp. 524-535, (2020); Yu, Haofeng, Process path planning based on efficiency model for ultrasonic cutting curved surface of honeycomb composite parts, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 11, 10, (2019); Xu, Qihao, Investigation on damage reduction method by varying cutting angles in the cutting process of rectangular Nomex honeycomb core, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 68, pp. 1803-1813, (2021)",""

However, the straightforward interplay between the service environment, strut structure, and their mechanical behavior has not been systematically explored. In this study, an analytical two-step prediction modeling is developed to efficiently obtain the mechanical response of 3D printed sandwich panels with FG lattice cores. Initially, the effective elastic moduli of FG lattice cores are identified based on finite element (FE) analysis. The stress and deformation of the core-homogenized sandwiches in thermal environments are predicted using the higher-order shear deformation theory. Subsequently, the de-homogenization is employed to calculate strut stresses. The prediction shows excellent agreement with the FE results in the literature. Furthermore, parametric analysis is performed to uncover the impact of crucial variables on the strut stresses within the FG lattice cores. The results show that the strut stress decreases with the increased transverse layer number and power index, while increasing with the higher ambient temperature, length-to-thickness ratio, and thermal expansion of the sandwich panels. The proposed model can serve as an efficient tool for the design and printing of high-performance lattice-core sandwich panels. © 2024","Additive manufacturing; Analytical modeling; Sandwich panel; Strut stress; Thermal environment","3D printing; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Thermal expansion; Analytical modeling; Functionally graded; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical modeling; Mechanical performance; Prediction modelling; Sandwich panel; Service environment; Strut stress; Thermal environment; Struts","Zhang, Ying, Functional additive manufacturing of large-size metastructure with efficient electromagnetic absorption and mechanical adaptation, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 173, (2023); Zhuo, Longchao, Low-cost and low-temperature 3D printing for refractory composite inspired by fused deposition modeling and binder jetting, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 162, (2022); Wang, Peng, Anisotropic compression behaviors of bio-inspired modified body-centered cubic lattices validated by additive manufacturing, Composites Part B: Engineering, 234, (2022); Zhang, Xinju, Numerical simulation on lattice structure construction and optimization method for additive manufacturing, Applied Energy, 325, (2022); Zhang, Zhipeng, Temperature- and moisture-dependent aeroelastic stability of graphene platelet reinforced nanocomposite lattice sandwich plates subjected to supersonic flow, Aerospace Science and Technology, 138, (2023); Chen, Xiuhua, Thermo-mechanical postbuckling analysis of sandwich cylindrical panels with functionally graded auxetic GRMMC core supported by elastic foundations, Ocean Engineering, 247, (2022); Robey, Edward H., Design optimization of an additively manufactured prototype recuperator for supercritical CO2 power cycles, Energy, 251, (2022); Li, Hao, Lightweight meta-lattice sandwich panels for remarkable vibration mitigation: Analytical prediction, numerical analysis and experimental validations, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 163, (2022); Fan, Meiling, Microstructure design and mechanical properties of 3D printed graded lattice sandwich structures with tailored porosity, Composite Structures, 321, (2023); Noronha, Jordan, Ti-6Al-4V hollow-strut lattice materials by laser powder bed fusion, Additive Manufacturing, 72, (2023)",""

Those with precisely defined geometries allow responses to be programmed to specific functions, but can be costly to design.

The numerical model force readings remained within 5% of the experiments. A further verification of the analytical model, varying all parameters within the honeycomb geometry, was undertaken for 5 J and 15 J impacts. The analytical model predicted energy absorption at all displacement increments to be (on average) 3% higher than the numerical one. The limits of agreement (with 95% confidence) were between +15 and −9% of the numerical model. The analytical model provided solutions almost instantly, so was used in a demonstrative parametric optimisation study, for a 10 J impact.

A honeycomb reinforcement design is proposed to mitigate side impact effects by adopting a special arrangement. The battery pack, consisting of 12 modules each with 417 LIB cells, was attached to the vehicle bottom in a “floor” configuration. Four scenarios were simulated, namely (i) baseline [no reinforcement, (S1)], (ii) LIB module with Aluminium Alloy 7075-T6 reinforcement (S2), (iii) LIB module with Stainless Steel 316L reinforcement (S3), and (iv) LIB module with Advanced High Strength Steel reinforcement (S4). Numerical results showed that among the 12 battery modules, only one suffered from significant damage in all scenarios. The maximum penetration for the baseline scenario was found to be 79.29 mm. The penetration was reduced by 22.4 %, 20.2 %, and 19.4 % after including the proposed reinforcement structure and using AHSS, AISI316L, and Al7075-T5 materials, respectively. The absorbed energy by the LIB cell component was reduced by around 0.5 MJ (i.e., 18.7 % reduction) when using the proposed reinforcement. The outcomes of this study showed the ability of the proposed reinforcement structure to mitigate the side impact effects on the LIB cells; however, further optimization studies using different materials and thicknesses are recommended. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Damage; Honeycomb; lithium-ion battery (LIB); Numerical modelling; Reinforcement; Side impact","Battery Pack; Damage detection; High strength steel; Honeycomb structures; Ions; Model automobiles; Reinforcement; Battery cells; Battery modules; Battery pack; Car models; Damage; Honeycomb; Lithium-ion battery; Reinforcement structures; Side impact; Vehicle manufacturers; Lithium-ion batteries","undefined, (2014); Iclodean, Cǎlin Doru, Comparison of Different Battery Types for Electric Vehicles, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 252, 1, (2017); Fuinhas, José Alberto, Effect of battery electric vehicles on greenhouse gas emissions in 29 European Union countries, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 24, (2021); Hao, Han, Electric vehicles for greenhouse gas reduction in China: A cost-effectiveness analysis, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 56, pp. 68-84, (2017); Navale, A.

The crushing behavior of honeycomb sandwich specimens subjected to the impact test was compared and discussed. Our results indicate that the carbon composite facesheets have a significant effect on the impact, resulting in an increase in impact resistance and a 157.14% increase in crack depth in the elastic region compared to glass facesheets reinforcement. This increase serves as an indicator of the laminate's ability to resist damage initiation and impact fracture mechanisms. Also, an increasing in flexural strength about 45.72% was observed in carbon facesheets honeycomb specimens compared to glass facesheets reinforcement. Microscopic illustration of the damaged honeycomb sandwich specimens was conducted to evaluate the interfacial characteristics and describe the damage mechanics of the composite facesheets and core adhesion under the impact test. The numerical approach proves to be efficient in terms of accuracy and simplicity compared to existing methods for predicting the damage mechanisms of honeycomb sandwich structures.

To address adhesive failure and premature collapse in traditional aluminium honeycomb, this study presents a novel approach - friction stir welded aluminium honeycomb. Traditional honeycombs can lose up to 50 % of their strength during low-velocity impacts, underscoring the need to comprehend the crashworthiness and crushing behaviour of this innovative solution. The study employs a robust finite element framework to predict crashworthiness parameters and deformation under flatwise compression. Enhanced with damage criterion, it offers more realistic predictions, indicating no debonding in welded regions. Most energy is dissipated through plastic folding, making it suitable for high-energy absorption applications. Damage initiates at the corner of the flanges due to stress concentration, minimized by a design modification to barrel-shaped honeycomb, boosting crushing strength by 21 %.

By establishing the relationship between the height of the cell and the cell-wall angle, HCS with different gradient modes were designed. The developed machine learning (ML) framework consisted of a forward regression model based on neural network (NN) and an inverse optimization model based on generative adversarial network (GAN). The regression model surrogated finite element analysis (FEA) to rapidly provide corresponding mechanical properties for the generated data of GAN. To ensure that the generated data met the desired design targets, additional physical constraints were incorporated into the generator of the GAN. This ensured that the network output not only consisted of valid data but also exhibited superior impact resistance. The results demonstrated that the trained ML model optimized both specific energy absorption (SEA) and initial peak stress of HCS. It even discovered high-performance gradient designs that outperformed the original data, with a maximum energy absorption 49.5% higher than that of uniform HCS. Moreover, the gradient modes and structural parameters of superior designs were identified, which is of great significance for the gradient design of HCS under impact loading. As a general design approach, this ML framework holds significant potential for the optimization design of metamaterials in other structures or with different mechanical properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Generative adversarial networks; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Inverse design; Machine learning","Biomechanics; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Regression analysis; Cell walls; Design frameworks; Graded honeycomb; High impact resistance; Impact loadings; Inverse designs; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Regression modelling; Generative adversarial networks; artificial neural network; design; finite element method; loading; machine learning; optimization; regression analysis; structural analysis","Li, Lingbo, A novel hybrid auxetic honeycomb with enhanced load-bearing and energy absorption properties, Engineering Structures, 289, (2023); Charekhli-Inanllo, Mojtaba, The effect of various shape core materials by FDM on low velocity impact behavior of a sandwich composite plate, Engineering Structures, 294, (2023); Gao, Yang, Graded honeycombs with high impact resistance through machine learning-based optimization, Thin-Walled Structures, 188, (2023); Wang, Menghuan, Machine learning accelerated design of auxetic structures, Materials and Design, 234, (2023); Zhu, Yazhi, Cyclic behavior of ellipse and peanut-shaped perforated buckling-restrained braces, Engineering Structures, 291, (2023); Li, Jinghui, Deep learning-enhanced design for functionally graded auxetic lattices, Engineering Structures, 292, (2023); Jiang, Weizhong, An improved re-entrant honeycomb with programmable densification and multistage energy-absorbing performance, Engineering Structures, 301, (2024); Zhu, Yilin, In-plane elastic properties of a novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with zigzag inclined ligaments, Engineering Structures, 268, (2022); Zhu, Difeng, A novel elliptical annular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced stiffness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 262, (2024); Zhang, Xiaolong, In-plane elasticity of a novel vertical strut combined re-entrant honeycomb structure with negative Poisson's ratio, Thin-Walled Structures, 163, (2021)",""

An impact finite element model of the subway vehicle’s anti-climb energy-absorbing device was established using LS-DYNA (v.17.2). The effects of the connecting diaphragm thickness, the inner and outer tube thicknesses of the thin-walled tubes, and the yield strength of the honeycomb aluminum on the energy absorption and impact force of the anti-climb energy-absorbing device were investigated. The results indicate that changes in the inner and outer tube thicknesses of the thin-walled tubes significantly affect the energy absorption and impact force of the anti-climb energy-absorbing device. However, changes in the connecting diaphragm thickness only increase the maximum energy absorption by up to 7.5% but have a significant impact on the maximum peak force. It was also found that the difference in energy absorption due to changes in the yield strength of the honeycomb aluminum is only 3.6%, suggesting that the yield strength of the honeycomb aluminum and the connecting diaphragm thickness have a limited influence on the crashworthiness design of the anti-climb energy-absorbing device. Furthermore, a multi-objective surrogate model characterizing the specific energy absorption and maximum peak force was established for the aforementioned four influential parameters using the response surface method. The model was then optimized using a genetic algorithm, resulting in optimal parameters that increased the energy absorption and specific energy absorption by 27.3% and 13.8%, respectively, compared to the original values, leading to a significant improvement in crashworthiness. The findings provide valuable references for and insights into the crashworthiness design and optimization of subway vehicles’ anti-climb energy-absorbing devices. © 2024 by the authors.","anti-climb energy-absorbing devices; crashworthiness; energy absorption characteristics; optimization; surrogate model","","Zhou, Hechao, Investigations on the vertical buckling of railway vehicle’s anti-climber, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 26, 2, pp. 171-181, (2021); Zhou, Hechao, Study on the Vertical Buckling of Railway Vehicle's Anti-climber, Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 55, 16, pp. 170-175, (2019); Gao, Guangjun, Experimental investigation of an active–passive integration energy absorber for railway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 117, pp. 89-97, (2017); Chinese Journal of Construction Machinery, (2018); Peng, Yong, Study on the collision performance of a composite energy-absorbing structure for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 94, pp. 663-672, (2015); Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, (2022); Yin, Hanfeng, Crashworthiness optimization design for foam-filled multi-cell thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 75, pp. 8-17, (2014); Zhang, Zonghua, Crashworthiness investigation of kagome honeycomb sandwich cylindrical column under axial crushing loads, Thin-Walled Structures, 48, 1, pp. 9-18, (2010); Yao, Shuguang, The impact performance of honeycomb-filled structures under eccentric loading for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 123, pp. 360-370, (2018); Forsberg, Jimmy, Evaluation of response surface methodologies used in crashworthiness optimization, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 5, pp. 759-777, (2006)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

The zero Poisson’s ratio honeycomb structure exhibits exceptional in-plane and out-of-plane deformation capacities, as well as a high load-bearing capability. To investigate the deformation characteristics of flexible rudder surfaces utilizing cosine honeycomb structures, this study undertakes a comprehensive investigation through finite element simulation and 3D printing experiments. Moreover, this study analyzed the impact of honeycomb parameters and layout on the deflection performance and weight. The flexible rudder surface, fabricated from nylon, achieves smooth and consistent chordwise bending deformation, as well as uniform spanwise deformation within a tolerance of ±25°, and the maximum equivalent stress observed was 31.99 MPa, which is within the material’s allowable stress limits (50 MPa). Finite element simulation results indicate that once the deflection angle of the rocker exceeds 15°, a discernible deviation arises between the actual deflection angle of the flexible control surface and that of the rocker. Furthermore, this deviation escalates with increasing rocker rotation angles, and this discrepancy can be mitigated by augmenting the number of cosine honeycomb cells within the flexible rudder surface. Finally, a prototype of the flexible rudder surface was successfully produced using 3D printing technology, and the experimental results confirmed the deformation behavior, aligning with simulation outcomes with a deviation of less than 20%. These findings confirm the effective deflection performance of the designed flexible rudder surface, highlighting its potential application in small unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2024 by the authors.","3D printing experiment; finite element analysis; flexible variant wings; zero Poisson’s ratio honeycomb","","Machine Building and Automation, (2010); Xiao, Hong, Application Status and Future Prospect of Aircraft Morphing Wing, Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 59, 19, pp. 1-23, (2023); Thill, Christophe, Morphing skins, Aeronautical Journal, 112, 1129, pp. 117-139, (2008); Li, Yuzhu, Design and experiment of concentrated flexibility-based variable camber morphing wing, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 35, 5, pp. 455-469, (2022); Zhu, Lianqing, Intelligent and Flexible Morphing Wing Technology:A Review, Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 54, 14, pp. 28-42, (2018); Kim, Nam-geuk, Hybrid composite actuator with shape retention capability for morphing flap of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Composite Structures, 243, (2020); Gu, Xiaojun, Integrated optimization design of smart morphing wing for accurate shape control, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 34, 1, pp. 135-147, (2021); Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology, (2017); Xu, Junheng, Design of wing mechanism with variable camber based on cross-spring flexural pivots, Zhejiang Daxue Xuebao (Gongxue Ban)/Journal of Zhejiang University (Engineering Science), 56, 3, pp. 444-509, (2022); Jia, Sijia, Wind Tunnel Tests of 3D-Printed Variable Camber Morphing Wing, Aerospace, 9, 11, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to examine the effect of a lattice unit’s vertex angle and strut diameter on the lattice structure’s Poisson’s ratio and effective elastic modulus. The strut diameter was altered from 0.2 to 1 mm, while the star-shaped vertex angle was adjusted from 15 to 90 degrees. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), an AM technique, was employed to experimentally fabricate 3D star-shaped honeycomb structures made of Ti<inf>6</inf>Al<inf>4</inf>V alloy, which were then subjected to compression testing to verify the modelling results. The effective elastic modulus was shown to decrease when increasing the vertex angle or decreasing the strut diameter, while the Poisson’s ratio had a complex behaviour depending on the geometrical characteristics of the structure. By tailoring the unit vertex angle and strut diameter, the printed structures exhibited negative, zero, and positive Poisson’s ratios, making them applicable across a wide range of aerospace components such as impact absorption systems, aircraft wings, fuselage sections, landing gear, and engine mounts. This optimization will support the growing demand for lightweight structures across the aerospace sector. © 2024 by the authors.","auxetic structures; laser powder bed fusion; Poisson’s ratio; star-shaped lattice structure","","Mechanics of Metamaterials with Negative Parameters, (2020); Lakes, Roderic S., Negative-Poisson's-Ratio Materials: Auxetic Solids, Annual Review of Materials Research, 47, pp. 63-81, (2017); Grima, Joseph N., Auxetic behavior from rotating squares, Journal of Materials Science Letters, 19, 17, pp. 1563-1565, (2000); Karathanasopoulos, Nikolaos, Enhanced Cellular Materials through Multiscale, Variable-Section Inner Designs: Mechanical Attributes and Neural Network Modeling, Materials, 15, 10, (2022); Rafsanjani, Ahmad, Bistable auxetic mechanical metamaterials inspired by ancient geometric motifs, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 9, pp. 291-296, (2016); El-Sayed, Mahmoud Ahmed, Design optimization of additively manufactured titanium lattice structures for biomedical implants, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 110, 9-10, pp. 2257-2268, (2020); Ghavidelnia, Naeim, Idealized 3D auxetic mechanical metamaterial: An analytical, numerical, and experimental study, Materials, 14, 4, pp. 1-36, (2021); Hassanin, Hany, 4D printing of NiTi auxetic structure with improved ballistic performance, Micromachines, 11, 8, (2020); Rogers, Greg J., Measurement of the mechanical properties of the ovine anterior cruciate ligament bone-ligament-bone complex: a basis for prosthetic evaluation, Biomaterials, 11, 2, pp. 89-96, (1990); Shirzad, Masoud, Auxetic metamaterials for bone-implanted medical devices: Recent advances and new perspectives, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 98, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

A cylindrical form factor with a diameter of 140 mm and a thickness of 15 mm is selected for the sandwich specimens. Four different stacking sequences of 1 mm carbon/epoxy face sheets are considered (i.e., quasi-isotropic, cross-ply, angle-ply, and unidirectional stacking). A computational model was con-structed using LS-DYNA finite element software and an inverse perforation testing scheme adapted with a split Hopkinson bar and confirmed by comparing these results with those obtained using the free shooting projectile-target testing schemes published in the literature. The effects of impact energy, failure modes, impact angles, and damage key parameters are analyzed. The results reveal the contact force versus displacement curves are highly influenced by the impact energy in-creases. The stacking sequence of the face sheets does not influence the energy absorption capacity. However, the maximum absorbed energy increases with an increasing impact angle up to 20°. Using Hopkinson bars in conjunction with the vir-tual inverse perforation testing approach is effective for examining the response of sandwich composites at high impact energies. © 2024 The Author(s).","composite sandwich panel; impact oblique; impact perforation; polymeric foam; simulation; stacking sequence","Bars (metal); Bridge decks; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Mechanical testing; Software testing; Stress-strain curves; Composite sandwich panels; Face sheets; Foam core; High impact energy; Impact oblique; Impact perforations; Polymeric foams; Simulation; Stacking sequence; Testing schemes; Sandwich structures","Abo Sabah, Saddam Hussein, Failure mode maps of bio-inspired sandwich beams under repeated low-velocity impact, Composites Science and Technology, 182, (2019); Acanfora, Valerio, Experimental and numerical assessment of the impact behaviour of a composite sandwich panel with a polymeric honeycomb core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 171, (2023); Akil Hazizan, Md, The low velocity impact response of foam-based sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 33, 3, pp. 193-204, (2002); Anderson, Todd A., Experimental investigation of low-velocity impact characteristics of sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 50, 3, pp. 239-247, (2000); Arezoo, S., Compressive deformation of Rohacell foams: Effects of strain rate and temperature, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 51, pp. 50-57, (2013); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Caprino, Giancarlo, The effect of shear on the local indentation and failure of sandwich beams with polymeric foam core loaded in flexure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 71, pp. 45-51, (2015); Carruthers, Joe J., Energy absorption capability and crashworthiness of composite material structures: A review, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 51, 10, pp. 635-649, (1998); Ls Dyna for Crashworthiness of Composite Structures, (2012); Chen, Liming, Compressive response of multi-layered thermoplastic composite corrugated sandwich panels: Modelling and experiments, Composites Part B: Engineering, 189, (2020)",""

However, these structures are plagued with weak core-to-facesheet bond strength. In this work, the effect of increasing the contact area between the composite facesheet and honeycomb core was studied. Sandwich panels were manufactured using two different honeycomb structures, a regular and a modified honeycomb, and their respective bond strengths were evaluated using the flatwise tension test (ASTM C297). The honeycombs were additively manufactured using selective laser melting process. The modified honeycomb was designed to have a larger surface area while retaining the same relative density as the regular honeycomb. The facesheets were made out of carbon-fiber, while the core was additively manufactured using 304L stainless steel powder. Impact specimens were manufactured and tested for impact resistance. A finite element model was created to study the integrity of the sandwich structures subjected to localized impact damage. The finite element model of the damage resistance due to impact showed a good agreement with the experimental results. Samples with increased contact area showed higher impact resistance. The average impact strength of the modified samples was 41.3% higher than the average impact strength of the regular samples. Flatwise tension results showed that by increasing the contact area between the core and the facesheet the core-to-facesheet bond strength increased. © 2024 The Korean Society for Composite Materials and IOP Publishing Limited.","bending stiffness; bending strength; core and facesheet; delamination; failure analysis; finite element analysis; sandwich composite structures","3D printing; Additives; Bending strength; Bond strength (materials); Carbon fibers; Composite structures; Compressive strength; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Sandwich structures; Steel fibers; Stiffness; Structural design; Structure (composition); Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Bending stiffness; Composites structures; Contact areas; Core and facesheet; Experimental and numerical studies; Face sheets; Finite element analyse; Finite element modelling (FEM); Sandwich composite structure; Sandwich composites; Finite element method","Analysis and Performance of Fiber Composites, (1990); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Anderson, Todd A., Experimental investigation of low-velocity impact characteristics of sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 50, 3, pp. 239-247, (2000); Hu, Heng, Review and assessment of various theories for modeling sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 84, 3, pp. 282-292, (2008); Schubel, Patrick M., Impact and post impact behavior of composite sandwich panels, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 38, 3, pp. 1051-1057, (2007); Horrigan, D.

In contrast to liners with discrete density differences, the use of a honeycomb-based liner reduces the concern about delamination, back face deformation and fracture propagation. The research involves comparing several parameters related to crashworthiness, such as specific energy absorption (SEA), crush force efficiency (CFE), and margin of safety, which are crucial for head protection and ensuring helmet injury tolerance. These parameters play a vital role in assessing the ability of different configurations of the honeycomb liner during impacts. Flatwise compression and dynamic impact tests were conducted to evaluate the helmet liner’s performance while maintaining consistency in the helmet shell component. Finite element analysis (FEA) and 3D x-ray Tomography techniques were utilized to analyse the back face deformation (BFD) at high-velocity impact and the internal damage resulting from impacts on the helmet liners, respectively. The results revealed that the 3D woven honeycomb liner configuration performs optimally in terms of energy absorption by demonstrating sufficient and balanced competency across these three critical factors. Additionally, the simulation result revealed that the 3D woven honeycomb liner exhibits wave propagation. This phenomenon enhances its energy absorption capacity and reduces back-face deformation attributed to its crushing behaviour. This research offers valuable insights for improving the performance of aircrew helmet liners, with a particular focus on utilizing 3D woven honeycomb liners featuring 3D woven solid structure to maintain exceptional structural integrity. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D woven composite; back face deformation; damage tolerance; finite element analysis; x-ray tomography","Aluminum; Behavioral research; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Honeycomb structures; Imaging systems; Safety devices; Tomography; Wave propagation; 3D woven; 3D woven composites; Back face deformation; Comparative analyzes; Face deformations; Finite element analyse; Helmet liners; Performance; Structural composites; X-ray tomography; Finite element method","Huang, Wenzhen, Crushing resistance tailoring of honeycomb material via vertex-derivative strategy, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Yang, Yan, Energy absorption characteristics of a super hexagonal honeycomb under out-of-plane crushing, Thin-Walled Structures, 189, (2023); Tripathi, Lekhani, Comparative analysis of aluminium core honeycomb with 3D woven Kevlar honeycomb composite, Materials Science and Technology (United Kingdom), 39, 14, pp. 1697-1708, (2023); Song, Runzi, Research on head-neck injuries of pilots during emergency ejection from the aircraft, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1213, 5, (2019); International Journal of Sustainable Aviation, (2022); Fang, Jianguang, Design of transversely-graded foam and wall thickness structures for crashworthiness criteria, Composites Part B: Engineering, 92, pp. 338-349, (2016); Ouellet, Simon, Compressive response of polymeric foams under quasi-static, medium and high strain rate conditions, Polymer Testing, 25, 6, pp. 731-743, (2006); Caserta, Gaetano D., Shock absorption performance of a motorbike helmet with honeycomb reinforced liner, Composite Structures, 93, 11, pp. 2748-2759, (2011); Shi, Shanshan, In-plane compressive response of composite sandwich panels with local-tight honeycomb cores, Composite Structures, 314, (2023); Zou, Zhenmin, Dynamic crushing of honeycombs and features of shock fronts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 165-176, (2009)",""

However, this particularity generates significant challenges during its shaping, requiring the use of cutting tools of the particular geometry. In this study, experimental tests were conducted on the milling of NHC structure assisted by RUM technology using the UCSB cutting tool which is a toothed milling cutter. However, the experimental procedure fails to follow the cutting process, which complicates the visualization of the chip formation process due to the rapid movement of the cutting tool and the inaccessibility of the surface between the part/tool. Therefore, in order to effectively follow chip formation, a 3D numerical approach to the milling process of the NHC structure, using RUM technology, is developed using Abaqus Explicit software. On the basis of this model, the study focused on the components of the cutting force, the quality of the machined surface, and the accumulation of chips in front of the cutting tool. The numerical simulation results corroborate the experimental test findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of RUM technology in reducing cutting force components by up to 63%. An exhaustive analysis of the impact of the feed component F<inf>y</inf> on the quality of the surface obtained was carried out, highlighting that the quality of the generated surface improves when the values of this component are low. In addition, the effectiveness of ultrasonic vibrations in reducing the accumulation of chips in front of the cutting tool is particularly accentuated, especially when large amplitudes are involved.

However, the unique structure of AHCs limits their manufacture. In this research, the damage mechanism of AHCs is firstly studied with polycrystalline diamond (PCD) circular saw blades to provide high-quality AHCs for wide-format honeycomb composites. The study meticulously examines the various forms of sawing damage incurred by AHCs at different material removal rates (MRR) and categorizes them accordingly. The results show that burrs of AHCs change from tiny blocks to larger strips with the MRR. At high MRR, the predominant failure modes include collapse, deformation, and hot cracking, while at low MRR, AHCs mainly suffer from cracking, micro-collapse, and oxidation by SEM and EDS analysis. A dynamic analytical model of the sawing angle is proposed based on the sawing trajectory to elucidate vibration scratching and burr formation. The effect of the sawing angle is quantified by the deformation displacement and damage area by the optical measurement. The microscopic reciprocating vibration scratching of AHCs is interpreted by the blade's vibration state. The causes of sawing damage at different MRRs are investigated, indicating that at high MRR, the increased impact of the sawtooth leads to severe vibration scratches, collapses, and strip burrs, whereas, at low MRR, the high-frequency scratching of the sawtooth tends to result in tearing and micro-collapses. A comprehensive description of burr formation is presented by a 3D finite element model. Additionally, the cutting heat is the main cause of the oxidation of sawing surfaces by EDS. This systematic investigation analyzes and explores the sawing damage mechanisms of AHCs, offering in-depth insights for optimizing the sawing process to eliminate surface quality problems and improve the sawing efficiency and accuracy of wide-format AHCs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum honeycomb core; Chemical behavior; High-speed sawing; Machining damage; Polycrystalline diamond; Sawing angle","Honeycomb structures; Optical data processing; Sawing; Vibration analysis; Aluminum honeycomb cores; Chemical behavior; Circular saw blade; Damage mechanism; High Speed; High-speed sawing; Machining damage; Material removal rate; Polycrystalline diamonds; Sawing angle; Aluminum","Ahmad, Shahzad, Processing technologies for Nomex honeycomb composites (NHCs): A critical review, Composite Structures, 250, (2020); Ahmad, Shahzad, Experimental study on rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) characteristics of Nomex honeycomb composites (NHCs) by circular knife cutting tools, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 58, pp. 524-535, (2020); Algolfat, Amna, Study of Centrifugal Stiffening on the Free Vibrations and Dynamic Response of Offshore Wind Turbine Blades, Energies, 15, 17, (2022); An, Qinglong, Experimental and Numerical Studies on Defect Characteristics during Milling of Aluminum Honeycomb Core, Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, 141, 3, (2019); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Cao, Wenjun, Cutting force prediction and experiment verification of paper honeycomb materials by ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 13, (2020); de Bartolomeis, Andrea, Future research directions in the machining of Inconel 718, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 297, (2021); Gao, Fei, Application of Lamb wave and its coda waves to disbond detection in an aeronautical honeycomb composite sandwich, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 146, (2021); Gospodarič, Bojan, Active vibration control of circular saw blades, European Journal of Wood and Wood Products, 73, 2, pp. 151-158, (2015); Jaafar, Mohamed, 3D numerical modeling and experimental validation of machining Nomex® honeycomb materials, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 115, 9-10, pp. 2853-2872, (2021)",""

However, these designs often lack a comprehensive analysis of other mechanical properties, leading to subpar mechanical performance. Previous studies have explored the mechanical properties response of enhanced re-entrant honeycombs (ERH) under impact conditions, revealing limitations in optimizing the structure's performance with a single objective. Therefore, this study aims to enhance ERH structural parameters to achieve superior mechanical performance through theoretical derivations and geometric optimizations. The results demonstrate that the proposed theoretical model is consistent with finite element analysis and response surface (RS) predictions. Expressions for Young's modulus, specific energy absorption, and compressive strength are proposed, facilitating the identification of structural parameters that meet specific requirements during reverse design. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization approach optimizes the geometric parameters based on maximum energy absorption and compressive strength. The mechanical behavior of the optimized ERH is investigated using the finite element method, revealing the energy absorption capacity of 13.78 J/g while maintaining Poisson's ratio at -1.06.

Firstly, a series of experiments and finite element (FE) simulations of internal explosions are implemented to understand the basic anti-explosion characteristics of a SECV and the rationality of the computational models and methods is verified by the comparison between the experimental results and simulation results. Based on this, the CECV is designed in detail and a variety of FE simulations are carried out to investigate effects of the sandwich structure, the explosive quantity and the laying mode of the fiber cloth on anti-explosion performance and dynamic response of the CECV under internal explosions. Simulation results indicate that the end cover is the critical position for both the SECV and CECV. The maximum pressure of the explosion shock wave and the maximum strain of the CECV can be extremely declined compared to those of the SECV. As a result, the explosive quantity the CECV can sustain is up to 20 times of that the SECV can sustain. Besides, as the explosive quantity increases, the internal pressure of the CECV keeps growing and the plastic deformation and failure of the sandwich structure become more and more severe, yielding plastic strain of the CECV in addition to elastic strain. The results also reveal that the laying angles of the fiber cloth's five layers have an impact on the anti-explosion performance of the CECV. For example, the CECV with fiber cloth layered in 0°/45°/90°/45°/0° mode has the optimal anti-capacity, compared to 0°/0°/0°/0°/0° and 0°/30°/60°/30°/0° modes. Overall, owing to remarkable anti-explosion capacity, this CECV can be regarded as a promising candidate for explosion resistance. © 2023 China Ordnance Society","Aluminum honeycomb core; Anti-explosion; Composite; Explosive container; Honeycomb-fiber cloth","Aluminum; Dynamic response; Explosions; Explosives; Honeycomb structures; Plastic deformation; Sandwich structures; Shock waves; Steel fibers; Aluminum honeycomb cores; Anti-explosion; Anti-explosion performance; Explosion containment vessels; Explosive container; Finite elements simulation; Honeycomb fiber; Honeycomb-fiber cloth; Multilayer composite; Single layer; Ductile fracture","Chen, Yongjun, Dynamic responses of discrete multi-layered explosion containment vessels with the consideration of strain-hardening and strain-rate effects, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 7, pp. 842-853, (2010); Ma, Li, Ductile and brittle failure assessment of containment vessels subjected to internal blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 52, pp. 28-36, (2013); Dong, Qi, Further study on strain growth in spherical containment vessels subjected to internal blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 2, pp. 196-206, (2010); Kornev, Vladimir M., Experimental investigation and analysis of the vibrations of the shell of an explosion chamber, Combustion, Explosion and Shock Waves, 15, 6, pp. 821-824, (1979); Martineau, Rick L., Expansion of cylindrical shells subjected to internal explosive detonations, Experimental Mechanics, 40, 2, pp. 219-225, (2000); Ma, Li, Failure analysis for cylindrical explosion containment vessels, Engineering Failure Analysis, 17, 5, pp. 1221-1229, (2010); Wang, Dengwang, Simulation of the Deformation and Failure Characteristics of a Cylinder Shell under Internal Explosion, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 3, (2022); Du, Yang, Coupled simulation of explosion-driven fracture of cylindrical shell using SPH-FEM method, International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping, 139-140, pp. 28-35, (2016); Li, Xiangyu, Experimental and numerical investigations on the dynamic fracture of a cylindrical shell with grooves subjected to internal explosive loading, Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics, 39, 5, pp. 723-732, (2014); Batalov, V.

Based on the traditional two-dimensional reentrant honeycomb structure, a modified three-dimensional (3D) reentrant lattice structure with negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) is proposed. The studies on fabrication and design parameters are conducted, leading to a new understanding of the effects of these parameters on the printing quality and mechanical properties of such lattice structure with reentrant diagonal struts. Additive manufacturing (AM), specifically laser powder bed fusion, is used to fabricate five groups of 18Ni350 Maraging Steel samples with different geometric and printing parameters. The compression test is conducted to obtain the effects of NPR on the quasi-static stress-strain relationship of the proposed structure. The results show that smaller hatch distance and scan speed for 3D printing process can lead to less porosity level and more complete printing, resulting in larger stiffness and yield strength of the structure. The preferred AM process variables to improve structural quality with thin angled struts (diameter £0.5 mm) are presented. Moreover, with the help of the tuned finite element model based on experimental results, parametric analysis is conducted to confirm the effect of design parameters, including reentrant angle, strut cross-section shape, and size, on the compressive properties of the structure. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","3D auxetic lattice structure; laser powder bed fusion; negative Poisson’s ratio; printing parameter effect; quasi-static compression","3D printing; Additives; Compression testing; Honeycomb structures; Maraging steel; Poisson ratio; Stress-strain curves; Structural design; 3d auxetic lattice structure; Auxetics; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Negative Poisson ratio; Parameters effects; Powder bed; Printing parameter effect; Quasi-static compression; Struts","Ashby, Michael F.A., MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF CELLULAR SOLIDS., Metallurgical Transactions A, 14 A, 9, pp. 1755-1769, (1983); Nazir, Aamer, A state-of-the-art review on types, design, optimization, and additive manufacturing of cellular structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 104, 9-12, pp. 3489-3510, (2019); Nazir, Aamer, Mechanical Performance of Lightweight-Designed Honeycomb Structures Fabricated Using Multijet Fusion Additive Manufacturing Technology, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 9, 4, pp. 311-325, (2022); Yu, Xianglong, Mechanical metamaterials associated with stiffness, rigidity and compressibility: A brief review, Progress in Materials Science, 94, pp. 114-173, (2018); Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Herakovich, Carl T., Composite Laminates with Negative Through-the-Thickness Poisson's Ratios, Journal of Composite Materials, 18, 5, pp. 447-455, (1984); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Comput Methods Sci Technol, (2004); Wagner, Marius A., Large shape transforming 4D auxetic structures, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 4, 3, pp. 133-141, (2017); Wei, Lulu, In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb: Experimental and numerical simulation, Aerospace Science and Technology, 115, (2021)",""

To explore the effectiveness of different natural fibers for producing honeycomb core sandwich panels, a Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis was performed on different natural fibers with different fiber orientations. The resistance to environmental deterioration of bending properties was also investigated. Overall, this work offers perceptive information about the mechanical characteristics of sandwich panels made of jute honeycomb core and their behavior under various climatic circumstances, which may be relevant in a variety of engineering applications. Finally, it is noteworthy that the mechanical properties of jute fibers are anisotropic, which implies that their strength varies with the direction of loading.

Initially, the mechanical properties and deformation modes of various proposed HPH metamaterials (HPH-U, HPH-1 L and HPH-3 L) under quasi-static vertical compression were analyzed using experimental and finite element methods. The findings reveal significant improvements in mechanical properties and energy absorption due to the honeycomb and hierarchical expandable design. Notably, the auxetic effect is diminished. Subsequently, the impact of key dimensional parameters on the mechanical properties and Poisson's ratio behavior was explored. The results highlighted that an increase of elliptical perforation major axis to minor axis ratio enhanced the auxetic effect but compromised load-bearing and absorptive capacity. Additionally, HPH metamaterials displayed exceptional performance under quasi-static horizontal compression, with their honeycomb structure enabling them to withstand both vertical and horizontal impacts while exhibiting excellent energy absorption capabilities. The study also identified relative density as a crucial factor influencing horizontal impact performance. Finally, the study subjected the HPH metamaterials to multiple quasi-static vertical repetitive compressions, meticulously analyzing variations in mechanical properties under diverse compression ratios. Due to distinctive structural design and impressive mechanical properties, HPH metamaterials demonstrate immense potential for applications in automotive engineering and sports protection fields. © 2024","Additive manufacturing; Auxetic; Cellular materials; Compression testing; Finite element modeling","3D printing; Biomechanics; Compaction; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Structural design; Auxetics; Cellular material; Deformation modes; Dimensional parameters; Element models; Finite element modeling; Mechanical deformation; Mechanical energies; Mechanical properties analysis; Quasi-static; Compression testing","Fan, Junxiang, A review of additive manufacturing of metamaterials and developing trends, Materials Today, 50, pp. 303-328, (2021); Galea Mifsud, Russell, A novel design method to produce 3D auxetic metamaterials with continuous pores exemplified through 3D rotating auxetic systems, Materials and Design, 226, (2023); Balan P, Madhu, Auxetic mechanical metamaterials and their futuristic developments: A state-of-art review, Materials Today Communications, 34, (2023); Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Yu, Xianglong, Mechanical metamaterials associated with stiffness, rigidity and compressibility: A brief review, Progress in Materials Science, 94, pp. 114-173, (2018); Hu, Jingdan, Superior compressive properties of 3D printed plate lattice mechanical metamaterials, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 231, (2022); Wan, Mengqi, 4D printed TMP origami metamaterials with programmable mechanical properties, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 250, (2023); Brighenti, Roberto, Thermo-mechanical performance of two-dimensional porous metamaterial plates, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 238, (2023); Akamatsu, Daichi, Two-phase topology optimization for metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio, Composite Structures, 311, (2023); Han, Dong, Experimental and computational investigations of novel 3D printed square tubular lattice metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio, Additive Manufacturing, 55, (2022)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Therefore, it was necessary to study the damage caused by the low-speed impact of composite sandwich structures. Based on the Hashin failure criterion, this paper established an equivalent finite element model of carbon fiber foam sandwich panels under low-velocity impact. The model was used to simulate the damage of the foam sandwich panel with [±45°/±45°/(core)/±45°/±45°] ply structure under the impact energy of 10.58, 21.17, 31.75, and 42.34 J. The simulation results of impact damage depth were compared with the experimental results. The error was less than 10%, which proved the rationality of the impact equivalent model. The model was used to predict and analyze the damage of foam sandwich panels with [±45°/(core)/±45°], [±45°/ (0°, 90°)/(core)/±45°], and [±45°/(0°, 90°)(core)/(0°, 90°)/±45°] ply structures under 21.17J impact energy. The low energy impact resistance was analyzed by comparing and analyzing the damage situation, impact force response time, and impact velocity response time. The results showed that increasing the number of ply layers [±45°] can reduce the impact damage degree and improve the bearing capacity of sandwich panels. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","carbon fiber foam sandwich structure; finite element numerical simulation; Hashin failure criterion; impact damage; low-velocity impact","Honeycomb structures; Carbon fiber foam sandwich structure; Failure criteria; Finite element numerical simulation; Foam sandwiches; Hashin failure criteria; Impact damages; Impact energy; Low velocity impact; Low-energy impact; Sandwich panel; Sandwich structures","Vlach, Jarmil, Strain-Field Modifications in the Surroundings of Impact Damage of Carbon/Epoxy Laminate, Polymers, 14, 16, (2022); No, (2021); Caminero, M.

However, the special characteristics of the Nomex honeycomb structure, including its composite nature and complex geometry, require a specific machining approach to avoid cutting defects and ensure optimal surface quality. To overcome this problem, this research suggests the adoption of RUM technology, which involves the application of ultrasonic vibrations following the axis of revolution of the UCK cutting tool.

To further enhance the energy absorption capacity of these materials, a novel re-entrant honeycomb configuration, named novel auxetic re-entrant honeycomb (NARH), is developed by incorporating “<>”-shaped cell walls into the conventional auxetic re-entrant honeycomb (ARH). Two analytical models for the plateau stress are formulated to consider the plastic deformation of NARH during quasi-static compression and the dynamic impact using the linear momentum theorem. Quasi-static compression tests on 3D printed NARH honeycomb specimens and finite element simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical models. NARH exhibits higher plateau stresses compared with ARH during compression, which can be attributed to the presence of more plastic hinges formed in NARH. These hinges, the embedded parts with inclined cell walls, not only improve stability by forming stable triangles during compression but also enhance the energy absorption capacity. A parametric study is conducted to analyze the effect of impact velocity, thickness, and incline angle of cell walls on crashworthiness. Numerical simulations demonstrate higher sensitivity of the mechanical properties to impact velocity and cell wall thickness. Adding ribs to the “<>”-shaped cell walls in NARH further reduces the initial peak force during dynamic crushing while maintaining high energy absorption. The research provides valuable guidelines for the design of energy absorption metamaterials. © Science China Press 2024.","auxetic effect; energy absorption; plastic hinges; re-entrant structure","3D printing; Anisotropy; Biomechanics; Cells; Compression testing; Crashworthiness; Cytology; Dynamics; Energy absorption; Hinges; Metamaterials; Struts; Auxetic effect; Auxetics; Cell walls; Energy absorption capacity; Impact velocities; Larger deformations; Plastic hinges; Plateau stress; Quasi-static compression; Re-entrant structure; Honeycomb structures","Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Ren, Xin, Auxetic metamaterials and structures: A review, Smart Materials and Structures, 27, 2, (2018); Wan, Hui, A study of negative Poisson's ratios in auxetic honeycombs based on a large deflection model, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 23, 1, pp. 95-106, (2004); Qi, Chang, Impact and close-in blast response of auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels: Experimental tests and numerical simulations, Composite Structures, 180, pp. 161-178, (2017); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing response of auxetic honeycombs under large deformation: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, Thin-Walled Structures, 131, pp. 373-384, (2018); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018); Jin, Xiaochao, Ballistic resistance and energy absorption of honeycomb structures filled with reactive powder concrete prisms, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 19, 5, pp. 544-571, (2017); Zeng, Qingliang, Damage evolution of PµLSE additive-manufactured micro-lattice metastructures: Synchrotron radiation 3D tomography image-based analysis, Science China: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy, 63, 10, (2020); Li, Chuanlei, A novel hybrid design method of lattice structure based on failure mode, Science China: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy, 65, 9, (2022); Qi, Chang, In-plane crushing response of tetra-chiral honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 130, pp. 247-265, (2019)",""

This study aims to leverage the plastic and elastic properties of these materials to develop a simplified numerical model that incorporates orthotropic properties for core modeling. By doing so, the need for detailed honeycomb structure modeling is eliminated, resulting in reduced computational costs and time. A comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model, accounting for structural intricacies, is presented based on experimental data from a reputable source (isotropic model) and its equivalent finite element model (orthotropic model). The model is validated by the experimental results, demonstrating good agreement. The study also investigates parameters such as energy absorption, the internal energy of the core and faces, maximum displacement, and maximum contact force under low-velocity impact scenarios with spherical and cylindrical projectiles. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the orthotropic model, particularly in showcasing greater energy absorption in the core of the sandwich panel when subjected to a cylindrical impactor. © The Author(s) 2024.","finite element analysis; homogenization; honeycomb; impact; sandwich panel","Finite element method; Homogenization method; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Comparatives studies; Composites material; Finite element analyse; Homogenization; Honeycomb; Honeycomb composite; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact; Orthotropic core; Sandwich panel; Energy absorption","Foo, Choon Chiang, Low-velocity impact failure of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 85, 1, pp. 20-28, (2008); Crupi, Vincenzo, Computed tomography-based reconstruction and finite element modelling of honeycomb sandwiches under low-velocity impacts, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 16, 4, pp. 377-397, (2014); Xu, Alan, Finite element analysis of indentation of aluminium foam and sandwich panels with aluminium foam core, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 599, pp. 125-133, (2014); Asprone, Domenico, Statistical finite element analysis of the buckling behavior of honeycomb structures, Composite Structures, 105, pp. 240-255, (2013); Xu, XiFrank Frank, Homogenized elastic properties of honeycomb sandwich with skin effect, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, 8, pp. 2153-2188, (2002); Nguyen, Minh Q., Simulation of impact on sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 67, 2 SPEC.

The accuracy of the finite element model is verified by experiments, and the mechanical characteristics and deformation modes of the honeycomb are studied by numerical simulation. First, the energy absorption and deformation modes of a star-shaped honeycomb with asymmetric cells were studied under low-, medium- and high-velocity impacts. Second, the influence of different angles and different wall thicknesses on the energy absorption of honeycomb was studied. The results show that model 3 exhibits obvious negative Poisson's ratio characteristics under different impact velocities. As the angle increases, the energy absorption and plateau stress of mode 1 also increase. However, for mode 3, increasing θ can enhance the negative Poisson's ratio, but the specific energy absorption and plateau stress of the structure will decrease.

Based on the geometric topology of the FSP system, three FSP configurations with the same areal density are derived, namely multi-layer, gradient core and asymmetric face sheet, and three key structural parameters are identified: core thickness (t<inf>c</inf>), face sheet thickness (t<inf>f</inf>) and overlap face/core number (n<inf>o</inf>). The ballistic performance of the FSP system is comprehensively evaluated in terms of the ballistic limit velocity (BLV), deformation modes, energy dissipation mechanism, and specific penetration energy (SPE). The results show that the FSP system exhibits a significant configuration dependence, whose ballistic performance ranking is: asymmetric face sheet > gradient core > multi-layer. The mass distribution of the top and bottom face sheets plays a critical role in the ballistic resistance of the FSP system. Both BLV and SPE increase with t<inf>f</inf>, while the raising t<inf>c</inf> or n<inf>o</inf> leads to an increase in BLV but a decrease in SPE. Further, a face-core synchronous enhancement mechanism is discovered by the energy dissipation analysis, based on which the ballistic optimization procedure is also conducted and a design chart is established.

Dynamic crushing experiments for foam-filled PHC structures were carried out using a direct impact Kolsky bar testing system. Reliable numerical simulations using both finite element method and smoothed particle hydrodynamics method were developed to analyze the dynamic crushing responses of F-PHC structures in the full range of deformation processes. Effects of inertia, strain-rate sensitivity, cell number, and impact velocity were evaluated. The results show that the dynamic plateau stresses of periodic hybrid cellular structures can be substantially enhanced by filling foams. The dynamic crushing response of F-PHC structure is very susceptible to impact velocity due to inertia effect. Compared with foam-filled hexagonal honeycomb and foam-filled re-entrant honeycomb structures, F-PHC structures exhibited superior dynamic crushing performances, including smoother and longer dynamic plateau stresses, more uniform deformation distributions, and much more stable deformation processes. Moreover, F-PHC structures exhibited much lower dynamic initial peak stresses at the rear face.

Its strength, rigidity, lightweight nature, low density, simple structure, cost-effectiveness, high load-carrying efficiency, remarkable load-bearing capacity, as well as excellent sound insulation and thermal insulation properties, have positioned the sinusoidal wave corrugated sandwich panel as an ideal choice for energy absorption devices. To evaluate the bending performance of the sinusoidal wave corrugated sandwich panel, this study fabricated single-layer and double-layer sinusoidal wave core sandwich panels using the light-curing molding process described in this research. The research analyzed the impact of various geometric parameters, including skin thickness, core layer thickness, core height, and corrugation wavelength, on the bending performance and failure modes of the single-layer sinusoidal wave core sandwich panels through three-point bending loading tests. The failure modes of the sinusoidal wave corrugated sandwich panel were validated using finite element simulation. Additionally, the study examined the bending performance of the sandwich panels with double-layer sinusoidal wave cores and investigated the influence of wavelength distribution in the upper and lower core layers on the force–displacement curve and energy absorption capacity of the double-layer sinusoidal wave core sandwich panel.

It poses a great safety threat to passengers and drivers. The honeycomb structure's high energy absorption and lightweight properties have made it a popular choice in the automotive industry. This paper designs different bio-inspired honeycomb structures to a battery-pack system of electric vehicles to improve the crashworthiness performance. The effects of different bio-inspired honeycomb structures on the crashworthiness of a battery-pack system during frontal impact are analyzed based on a nonlinear finite element model. First, the geometric parameters of seven different bio-inspired honeycomb individual units are described. The overall structure of the honeycomb is applied to a battery-pack system. Second, the nonlinear finite element model of a battery-pack system and honeycomb structures are established and verified. Then, collision simulations are conducted. The deformation and the maximum stress of a battery-pack's bottom shell are computed. The energy absorbed by the honeycomb structures during frontal impact are investigated. The results indicate that the proposed bio-inspired honeycomb structure mimicking grass stems improves the safety performance of battery-pack systems most. Finally, a parametric design is carried out on the bio-inspired honeycomb structure. The effects of wall thicknesses and the number of replacement hexagons on the crashworthiness performance are analyzed. The honeycomb structure preforms best when thickness is 1 mm and the number of replacement hexagons is 2 and 4.

The focus is on incorporating a 2D re-entrant honeycomb unit cell known by its unique negative Poisson’s ratio to investigate this auxetic behavior’s impact on the performance of the BRBs under cyclic loading. Methods: A finite element (FE) analysis is conducted on numerical models of four all-BRBs with different auxetic core configurations. The samples are subjected to cyclic loading. To describe the cyclic deformation behavior of the steel core, a Chaboche model with combined hardening was used, and the resulting average stress and average strain were analyzed. The proposed model was validated through a recent experimental test. Finally,a parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of porosity, section weakening rate, concave angle, and angle chamfering radius on the auxetic behavior of the steel core in terms of hysteresis curves, stress distribution, and dissipated energy. Results: The results showed that local buckling of AC-BRBs could be enhanced by improving the auxetic behavior of the core brace. The values of 75° angle and 0.5 corner chamfer radius were found to have the most significant effect on the hysteresis curves of ACBRB specimens when the axial strain exceeded 1.2%. These results suggest that welldesigned all-steel BRBs with auxetic cores can achieve the desired functionality of BRB devices and highlight the potential of auxetic core incorporation into BRBs as a promising approach to enhance their performance under cyclic loading, thus contributing to improved seismic resilience in civil engineering applications. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Auxetic core; Buckling restrained braces; Cyclic loading; Energy dissipation; Hysteresis behavior; Re-entrant honeycomb","","Etude Du Comportement Des Structures En Acier Sous Sollicitations Sismiques Contreventees Par Amortisseurs A Fluides Visqueux Doctoral Dissertation in Civil Engineering, (2015); Component Testing Stability Analysis and Characterization of Buckling Restrained Unbonded Braces, (2002); Ce Pap, (2017); Mirtaheri, Masoud, Experimental optimization studies on steel core lengths in buckling restrained braces, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 67, 8, pp. 1244-1253, (2011); Takeuchi, Toru, Effect of local buckling core plate restraint in buckling restrained braces, Engineering Structures, 44, pp. 304-311, (2012); Mosalman, Hassanali, Seismic Study of Buckling Restrained Brace System without Concrete Infill, International Journal of Steel Structures, 18, 1, pp. 153-162, (2018); Chen, Quan, Effect of the unbonding materials on the mechanic behavior of all-steel buckling-restrained braces, Engineering Structures, 111, pp. 478-493, (2016); Gao, Yuan, Experimental investigation on buckling-restrained braces using mortar-filled steel tubes with steel lining channels, Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings, 29, 4, (2020); Pandikkadavath, Muhamed Safeer, Development and subassemblage cyclic testing of hybrid buckling-restrained steel braces, Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Vibration, 19, 4, pp. 967-983, (2020); Bashiri, Mehdi, Numerical and experimental investigation on a BRB confined with partially carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), Engineering Structures, 223, (2020)",""

The carbon fiber composite hexagonal honeycomb panels were fabricated using the hot press molding method. Then, low-velocity drop-weight impact tests on the composite honeycomb panels were conducted under impact energy levels of 5J, 10J, 30J, 50J, 60J, 70J, and 100J to study the deformation mechanisms and damage modes. The VUMAT was developed to model the behavior of sandwich panels, in which a progressive damage model based on the strain-based failure criterion of composite fabric and Yeh delamination failure criteria was implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit. Two-dimensional topological honeycomb configurations with the same relative density were established. The energy absorption and load-bearing capacity of hexagonal, square, triangular, Kagome, and two kinds of circular (CS and CH types) honeycombs under 100J impact energy were discussed. The results showed that the circular honeycomb (CH type) had the largest first peak force of 6.714 kN, while the hexagonal honeycomb had the smallest first peak force of 3.715 kN.

However, none of these investigations have studied the side impact of empty and foam-filled honeycomb absorbers and adding stiffeners between the different layers of the corrugated sheets which are composing the honeycomb structure to analyse the structure under transverse (L-direction) impacts. In this paper, the foam-filled and reinforced honeycomb crash absorbers are investigated under axial (T) and transverse (L) loading directions. Experimental results for both empty and foam-filled specimens under quasi-static and impact loads were implemented to validate the developed finite element model. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to find out the crashworthiness behaviour of the structure under axial and transverse impacts according to road conditions. Finally, a new design of stiffened honeycomb crash absorber was developed and investigated to reduce the level of acceleration experienced by the passengers during the crash event. In this regard, it is concluded that all the requirements related to the energy absorption capabilities and generated deceleration under impact loading can be met by introducing an advanced method to reinforce honeycomb absorbers using stiffeners. It is also proven that the thickness of these stiffeners will not significantly influence the force levels. Due to increase of wall thickness from 1 to 3 mm, the mean crushing force increased from 129 kN to 148 kN. This growth is not sufficient as the goal is to obtain a mean crushing force of 300 kN. Thickening the stiffeners would lead to a loss of efficiency of the structure, as the small increase in mean force would not make up for the gain in mass.

These effects can cause uneven temperature distributions and drastic vibrations, which in turn impact the vibration characteristics of the vehicle structure. To address this issue, a comprehensive approach was developed to study the behavior of honeycomb sandwich structures in high-temperature environments. Firstly, a full-field thermal vibration testing system was established, which allowed for free-boundary multi-temperature region heating at 900 °C while applying unconnected excitation. Through this setup, we were able to obtain modal frequencies and modal shapes of the honeycomb sandwich structures under high-temperature conditions. To accurately simulate the heat transfer distribution of the honeycomb sandwich structure, the Q-learning algorithm was employed, which proved effective in achieving accurate and detailed predictions of the full-field heat transfer distribution. Furthermore, for the purpose of further enhancing the accuracy of the finite element model, a multi-state non-uniform temperature field model updating method was utilized. This updated model accounted for the influence of the multi-temperature region heating, resulting in a more reliable representation of the structure's behavior. Additionally, a variational mode decomposition (VMD) framework was applied to visualize and analyze the modal shapes of the honeycomb sandwich structures. By decomposing the time-domain signals with VMD, it is possible to efficiently obtain the modal shapes of the output-only response signals. Experimental results demonstrated that the identification method used in this study produced modal frequencies and modal shapes that closely matched those obtained using the PolyMAX method at room temperature. Therefore, the proposed approach offers an effective means of identifying the modal characteristics of structures subjected to non-uniform temperature fields, particularly in output-only scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Digital image correlation; Full-field vibration measurement of non-uniform temperature field; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Model updating; Output-only modal parameter identification; Variational mode decomposition","Honeycomb structures; Hypersonic vehicles; Learning algorithms; Modal analysis; Sandwich structures; Temperature; Time domain analysis; Vibration analysis; Vibration measurement; Digital image correlations; Full-field vibration measurement of non-uniform temperature field; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Measurements of; Modal-parameter identifications; Model updating; Nonuniform temperature; Output only; Output-only modal parameter identification; Uniform temperature field; Variational mode decomposition","Gao, Yong, Experimental investigations of thermal modal parameters for a C/SiC structure under 1600 °C high temperature environment, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 151, (2020); Wu, Dafang, Experimental and computational investigations of thermal modal parameters for a plate-structure under 1200 °C high temperature environment, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 94, pp. 80-91, (2016); Li, Jinming, Vibration analysis of thick-section sandwich structures in thermal environments, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 241, (2023); Zhang, Xiaolei, Thermal vibration characteristics of fiber-reinforced mullite sandwich structure with ceramic foams core, Composite Structures, 131, pp. 99-106, (2015); Bai, Yunhe, Experimental and simulation investigation of temperature effects on modal characteristics of composite honeycomb structure, Composite Structures, 201, pp. 816-827, (2018); Peng, Fuhao, Adaptive modal identification of honeycomb thin-walled composite structures with pit defects under thermal modal testing using variational mode decomposition technique based on digital image correlation, Thin-Walled Structures, 188, (2023); Bai, Yunhe, Impact Series Shaker Excitation Approach for Structural Modal Testing in Thermal Environments, Experimental Techniques, 42, 4, pp. 429-438, (2018); Hu, Yujia, Stochastic thermal modal characteristics of a plate with free boundary conditions induced by a random heating position based on a thermally coupled model, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 552, (2023); Schewe, Marvin, Differential laser Doppler vibrometry for displacement measurements down to 1 mHz with 1 nm amplitude resolution in harsh environments, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 210, (2023); Cheng, Hao, Effects of radiation heating on modal characteristics of panel structures, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 52, 4, pp. 1228-1235, (2015)",""

The out-of-plane impact resistance characteristics and mechanical properties of the proposed HBHs are investigated by means of test, theoretical analysis, and finite element (FE) analysis. In the process of deriving the theoretical model of HBHs, the novel 5-panel and 7-panel membrane energy dissipation corner elements are firstly proposed and reasonable theoretical solutions for them are obtained. Theoretical results suggest that the errors between numerical and theoretical results for the majority of the HBHs are within 7 %. In addition, the studies indicate that the HBHs outperform the circular honeycomb (CH) in terms of crashworthiness while ensuring that their relative densities are the same. The complex proportional assessment method is utilized to evaluate the crashworthiness of HBH<inf>_n_6_1.5</inf> (n represents the number of ribs, 6 represents the size of the outer diameter, and 1.5 represents the ratio (ζ) of the outer diameter to the inner diameter) under the same relative density. Furthermore, results suggest that energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of HBH<inf>_16_6_1.5</inf> are 31.31 % and 25.54 % higher than those of CH, respectively. Subsequently, the influences of geometric parameters, including the ζ and the thickness-to-cell length ratio (TL), on the impact resistance of HBH<inf>_16_6_1.5</inf> are investigated thoroughly. The findings show that when the ζ is within 1.2–1.5, the HBHs can exert their maximum potential, in which the inner diameter of HBHs is close to its outer diameter. Also, the findings demonstrate that the HBHs will undergo three distinct deformation modes. When the TL is roughly within 0.0200–0.0267, the deformation of HBHs will be in the transition deformation mode. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bionic strategy; Deformation modes; Honeycomb structures; Theoretical model","Biomechanics; Bionics; Crashworthiness; Energy dissipation; Bionic strategy; Cell lengths; Circular honeycombs; Cross-sectional structures; Deformation modes; Inner diameters; Length ratio; Outer diameters; Relative density; Theoretical modeling; Honeycomb structures","Wu, Xiong, Dynamic responses and energy absorption of sandwich panel with aluminium honeycomb core under ice wedge impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 162, (2022); Zhang, Yu, Dynamic mechanical behaviour and energy absorption of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under repeated impact loads, Ocean Engineering, 219, (2021); Fan, Wei, Crashworthiness and energy absorption of UHPFRC-steel composite sandwich structures under impact loading, Composite Structures, 311, (2023); Xie, Ruihong, Crushing behavior and protective performance of varying cores in UHPFRC-steel-foam sandwich structures: Experiment, optimal selection and application, Thin-Walled Structures, 172, (2022); Gao, Guangjun, Experimental investigation of an active–passive integration energy absorber for railway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 117, pp. 89-97, (2017); Yang, Chengxing, Transfer learning-based crashworthiness prediction for the composite structure of a subway vehicle, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 248, (2023); Wang, Zhonggang, Mechanical behavior of composited structure filled with tandem honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 114, pp. 128-138, (2017); undefined, (2011); Suzuki, Toshiyuki, Nonablative lightweight thermal protection system for Mars Aeroflyby Sample collection mission, Acta Astronautica, 136, pp. 407-420, (2017); Le, Vinh Tung, Advanced sandwich structures for thermal protection systems in hypersonic vehicles: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 226, (2021)",""

Minimizing brusing and damage can be achieved by designing energy-absorbing structures and packaging systems in order to ensure the long-term quality of fresh produce. The aim of this study is to investigate the response and bruise susceptibility of pears under impact loading conditions through finite element analysis (FEA) methods. In this paper, three impact heights (0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m), four impact material surfaces (poplar wood, rubber, cardboard, and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic), two packaging sizes (standard 0.22″ and sandwich lattice 2.1″), and three impact design structures (rigid, corrugated, and honeycomb) are considered. Based on mesh sensitivity analysis, a mesh element of 1.5 mm was adopted for all simulations, assuring the accuracy of results and considering the trade-off between mesh size and computational time. The response surface analysis approach was utilized in order to develop predictive empirical models related to pear bruising. Results revealed that the rubber-based impact platform yielded minimal bruise susceptibility at all heights, while standard-sized corrugated cardboard performed best at a height of 0.25 m. Furthermore, single, double, and triple layers of packaging cardboard were tested. We observed that adding a second soft layer of corrugated cardboard reduced the stress on the pear by around 33%. However, adding a third layer only reduced stress by 5%. The 3D-printed honeycomb ABS has potential as protective packaging but would require further investigations and parameter optimization. Stacking multiple layers of cardboard on top of each other is a cost-effective solution that could improve damping and, therefore, ensure good quality and increase the shelf life of the fresh produce. This study will help decision-makers select the optimal energy-absorbing material for cushioning and packaging designs in order to improve the handling and post-harvesting logistics of fresh produce. © 2024 by the authors.","bruise susceptibility; corrugated packaging; energy absorption; explicit dynamics simulation; finite element analysis; honeycomb; postharvest transport technology","","Al-Dairi, M., Mechanical damage of fresh produce in postharvest transportation: Current status and future prospects, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 124, pp. 195-207, (2022); A Study of Waste in the Cold Food Chain and Opportunities for Improvement, (2020); Ma, Lili, Multi-omics analysis reveals the mechanism of calcium-reduced quality deterioration in mechanically injured green pepper fruit, Postharvest Biology and Technology, 204, (2023); Satitmunnaithum, Junjira, Microbial population size and strawberry fruit firmness after drop shock-induced mechanical damage, Postharvest Biology and Technology, 192, (2022); Pathare, Pankaj B., Bruise Susceptibility and Impact on Quality Parameters of Pears During Storage, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 5, (2021); Hussein, Zaharan M., Effects of bruising and storage duration on physiological response and quality attributes of pomegranate fruit, Scientia Horticulturae, 267, (2020); African Journal of Rural Development, (2017); Opara, Umezuruike Linus, Bruise damage measurement and analysis of fresh horticultural produce-A review, Postharvest Biology and Technology, 91, pp. 9-24, (2014); Körzendörfer, Adrian, Vibrations and ultrasound in food processing – Sources of vibrations, adverse effects, and beneficial applications – An overview, Journal of Food Engineering, 324, (2022); Ngo, Tuan, Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Composites Part B: Engineering, 143, pp. 172-196, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Mantis shrimp can scrape the shells of prey molluscs with its hammer-shaped stick, while beetles have highly adapted forewings that are lightweight, tough, and strong. This paper introduces a design approach for bioinspired lattice structures by mimicking the internal microstructures of a beetle’s forewing, a mantis shrimp’s shell, and a mantis shrimp’s dactyl club, with improved mechanical properties. Finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental characterisation of 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) samples with bioinspired structures were performed to determine their compression and impact properties. The results showed that designing a bioinspired lattice with unit cells parallel to the load direction improved quasi-static compressive performance, among other lattice structures. The gyroid honeycomb lattice design of the insect forewings and mantis shrimp dactyl clubs outperformed the gyroid honeycomb design of the mantis shrimp shell, with improvements in ultimate mechanical strength, Young’s modulus, and drop weight impact. On the other hand, hybrid designs created by merging two different designs reduced bending deformation to control collapse during drop weight impact. This work holds promise for the development of bioinspired lattices employing designs with improved properties, which can have potential implications for lightweight high-performance applications. © 2024 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; bio-inspired design; energy absorption; lattice structure; light-weight aerospace structures","Additives; Biomimetics; Drops; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Structural design; Structural properties; 3-D printing; Aerospace structure; Bio-inspired designs; Drop-weight impacts; Energy absorption properties; Gyroids; Lattice structures; Light weight; Light-weight aerospace structure; Recent progress; 3D printing","Fan, Zheng, Quasi-static axial compression of thin-walled tubes with different cross-sectional shapes, Engineering Structures, 55, pp. 80-89, (2013); Liu, Wangyu, Dynamic performances of thin-walled tubes with star-shaped cross section under axial impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 100, pp. 25-37, (2016); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical studies on indentation and perforation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 110-124, (2018); Rong, Yu, Effects of geometric configurations of corrugated cores on the local impact and planar compression of sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 152, pp. 324-335, (2018); Tiwari, G., Energy absorption characteristics of thin aluminium plate against hemispherical nosed projectile impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 126, pp. 246-257, (2018); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); El-Sayed, Mahmoud Ahmed, Design optimization of additively manufactured titanium lattice structures for biomedical implants, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 110, 9-10, pp. 2257-2268, (2020); Hassanin, Hany, Controlling the Properties of Additively Manufactured Cellular Structures Using Machine Learning Approaches, Advanced Engineering Materials, 22, 3, (2020); Ha, Ngoc-san, A review of recent research on bio-inspired structures and materials for energy absorption applications, Composites Part B: Engineering, 181, (2020); Hassanin, Hany, 4D printing of NiTi auxetic structure with improved ballistic performance, Micromachines, 11, 8, (2020)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

ABAQUS is used to establish and effectively verify the finite element (FE) model of the BIH sandwich panel. To systematically compare and study the mechanical properties of BIH and conventional hexagonal honeycomb sandwich panels under low-velocity impact, the maximum displacement of face-sheets, the deformation mode, the plastic energy consumption and the dynamic response curve of the impact end are presented. At the same time, the performance differences between them are revealed from the perspective of an energy absorption mechanism. Furthermore, the influence of the circumscribed circle diameter ratio of the BIH trunk to branch (γ), the thickness ratio of the trunk to branch (K) and the impact angle (θ) on impact resistance is studied. Finally, the BIH sandwich panel is further optimized by using the response surface method. It can be concluded that, compared to conventional hexagonal honeycomb sandwich panels, the addition of walls in the BIH sandwich panel reduces the maximum deformation of the rear face-sheet by 10.29% and increases plastic energy consumption by 8.02%. Properly adjusting the structural parameters can effectively enhance the impact resistance of the BIH sandwich panel. © 2024 by the authors.","energy absorption; low-velocity impact; numerical analysis; sandwich structure","ABAQUS; Biomimetics; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Energy utilization; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural design; Composite sandwich structure; Core composites; Energy-consumption; Face sheets; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Low velocity impact; Mechanical behavior; Plastic energy; Energy absorption","Yahaya, Mohd Azman, Response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to foam projectile impact - An experimental study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 100-109, (2015); Wowk, Diane D., An experimental and numerical investigation of core damage size in honeycomb sandwich panels subject to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 254, (2020); Alavi, Ali, Experimental and numerical investigations of the effect of cellular wired core on the ballistic resistance of sandwich structures, Aerospace Science and Technology, 70, pp. 445-452, (2017); Vaziri, Ashkan, Metal sandwich plates subject to intense air shocks, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 44, 6, pp. 2021-2035, (2007); Palomba, Giulia, Single and double-layer honeycomb sandwich panels under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 121, pp. 77-90, (2018); Foster, Leon I., Application of auxetic foam in sports helmets, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 3, (2018); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Bahei-El-Din, Yehia A., Enhancement of blast resistance of sandwich plates, Composites Part B: Engineering, 39, 1, pp. 120-127, (2008); van Quyen, Nguyen, Nonlinear forced vibration of sandwich cylindrical panel with negative Poisson's ratio auxetic honeycombs core and CNTRC face sheets, Thin-Walled Structures, 162, (2021); Abbadi, Ahmed, Experimental study on the fatigue behaviour of honeycomb sandwich panels with artificial defects, Composite Structures, 120, pp. 394-405, (2015)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The structure has dual platform stress, which can reduce the initial peak stress generated during collisions, reducing injuries to pedestrians and vehicle occupants. The accuracy of the finite element numerical model is verified by experiments, and a series of researches are carried out. The mechanical properties of the structure at different velocities are studied and the classification diagram of deformation modes is obtained. Under low-speed impact load, ARTH has two deformation stages and two stress plateau regions, in which the stress of the second plateau is more than twice that of the first plateau. Then, a theoretical model based on plastic dissipation theory predicts the stress platform at different deformation stages under quasi-static conditions. Parametric analysis shows that increasing wall thickness t can significantly improve the stress platform and energy absorption, but the negative Poisson's ratio effect is weakened. The influence of angle θ on the first stage deformation of ARTH is significant. These studies can provide some references for the design of double-platform stress and the reduction of initial peak stress of rotating auxiliary structures. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","crashworthiness; deformation mode; in-plane impact; negative Poisson's ratio; rotating triangle honeycomb","Crashworthiness; Poisson ratio; Rigid structures; Stresses; Structural design; Auxetics; Deformation modes; Deformation stages; Finite element numerical models; Impact characteristics; In-plane impact; Negative Poisson ratio; Peak stress; Rotating triangle honeycomb; Vehicle occupants; Honeycomb structures","Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); Wang, Tao, Elastic analysis of auxetic cellular structure consisting of re-entrant hexagonal cells using a strain-based expansion homogenization method, Materials and Design, 160, pp. 284-293, (2018); Tan, Hailun, In-plane crashworthiness of re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio, Composite Structures, 229, (2019); Grima, Joseph N., On the potential of connected stars as auxetic systems, Molecular Simulation, 31, 13, pp. 925-935, (2005); Wei, Lulu, In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb: Experimental and numerical simulation, Aerospace Science and Technology, 115, (2021); Jiang, Feng, Quasi-static crushing behavior of novel circular double arrowed auxetic honeycombs: Experimental test and numerical simulation, Thin-Walled Structures, 177, (2022); Montgomery-Liljeroth, Ebba, Elastic properties of 2D auxetic honeycomb structures- a review, Applied Materials Today, 30, (2023); Qi, Chang, In-plane crushing response of tetra-chiral honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 130, pp. 247-265, (2019); Qiu, Kepeng, Optimization design of chiral hexagonal honeycombs with prescribed elastic properties under large deformation, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 33, 3, pp. 902-909, (2020); Zhang, Yi, In-plane compressive properties of assembled auxetic chiral honeycomb composed of slotted wave plate, Materials and Design, 221, (2022)",""

We found that concave cells provide shear stiffness that is a few folds larger than that of convex cells. Here we test whether altering the cell curvature can reduce head rotational kinematics and brain strain and whether the viscoelastic cell arrays outperform the reference EPS foam-based liner. To test these hypotheses, we incorporate the viscoelastic cell arrays in a bicycle helmet liner. We use validated finite element models of the helmet and replace the liner with validated finite element models of the cellular cell arrays. We simulate oblique impacts at different locations to represent a wide range of real-world bicycle head impacts. In all cases, the head kinematics and brain deformation metrics indicate significant improvements with the novel cell arrays over the conventional EPS liner. We show that the shear-compliant cell arrays can reduce head rotational acceleration by as much as 64 % and brain strain by 69 %, but not in all impact locations. Cell arrays with similar axial stiffness yet lower shear stiffness often bottomed out, indicating that a considerable amount of energy is dissipated via cell shearing around the impact zone. Our results show that placement of cells with varying amounts of shear stiffness should be optimised, with the most shear-compliant cells near the crown and the least near the temples. This study shows the promising performance of viscoelastic cell arrays in protecting the head and brain under oblique impacts and provides avenues for optimising the distribution of their compressive-shear properties. © 2024 The Authors","Brain injury; Energy absorption; Helmets; Oblique impact; Viscoelastic","Brain; Cytology; Finite element method; Kinematics; Location; Safety devices; Stiffness; Viscoelasticity; Brain injury; Brain strains; Cell array; Head impact; Head motion; Helmet; Helmet liners; Oblique impact; Shear stiffness; Viscoelastics; Cells","undefined; Wen, Liming, Inverse associations between cycling to work, public transport, and overweight and obesity: Findings from a population based study in Australia, Preventive Medicine, 46, 1, pp. 29-32, (2008); Hamer, Mark, Active commuting and cardiovascular risk: A meta-analytic review, Preventive Medicine, 46, 1, pp. 9-13, (2008); Møller, Niels Christian, The effect on cardiorespiratory fitness after an 8-week period of commuter cycling - A randomized controlled study in adults, Preventive Medicine, 53, 3, pp. 172-177, (2011); Nilsson, Philip, Modelling the effect on injuries and fatalities when changing mode of transport from car to bicycle, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 100, pp. 30-36, (2017); Rizzi, Matteo, Cyclist injuries leading to permanent medical impairment in sweden and the effect of bicycle helmets, pp. 412-423, (2013); Baker, Claire E., The relationship between road traffic collision dynamics and traumatic brain injury pathology, Brain Communications, 4, 2, (2022); Te Ao, Braden James, Cost of traumatic brain injury in New Zealand: Evidence from a population-based study, Neurology, 83, 18, pp. 1645-1652, (2014); Gaither, Thomas W., Estimated total costs from non-fatal and fatal bicycle crashes in the USA: 1997-2013, Injury Prevention, 24, 2, pp. 135-141, (2018); Høye, Alena Katharina, Bicycle helmets – To wear or not to wear?

First, quasi-static compression was performed on three structures, including a conventional tetra-missing rib honeycomb, and the experimental results showed that both symmetrical designs could effectively improve the plastic deformation of the conventional tetra-missing rib honeycomb. At the same time, round holes were introduced into the three honeycomb structures, and the mechanical properties and deformation modes of the three structures under quasi-static loads were explored. The results of two sets of experiments were compared, and it was found that the introduction of round holes could improve the structural stiffness of the honeycomb. Second, Abaqus/Explicit was used to construct a finite element numerical model in the later stage, and the accuracy of the model was verified. The number of honeycomb cells was determined for the three honeycomb structures, and finally, the dynamic Poisson's ratio of the honeycomb structure in plastic deformation was determined, and the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect of the three honeycombs was compared. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","In-plane impact; Mechanical properties; Quasi-static compression; Tetra-missing rib honeycomb","ABAQUS; Plastic deformation; Poisson ratio; Structural design; Crushing performance; Deformation modes; Experimental and numerical studies; In-plane impact; Mechanical deformation; Monoclinics; Quasi-static compression; Structural characteristics; Symmetrical design; Tetra-missing rib honeycomb; Honeycomb structures; plastic; polylactic acid; animal product; Article; cell count; chemical structure; comparative study; compression; crushing strength; dynamic poisson ratio; energy absorption; experimental study; finite element analysis; load bearing; measurement accuracy; mechanical test; mechanics; negative poisson ratio; physical phenomena; plastic deformation; rigidity; statistical parameters; stress strain relationship; structure analysis; tensile strength; tetra missing rib honeycomb; thickness; three dimensional printing; animal; food; rib; sponge (Porifera); Animals; Food; Porifera; Ribs","Alomarah, Amer, Compressive properties of 3D printed auxetic structures: experimental and numerical studies, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 15, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Chen, Yu, Curved inserts in auxetic honeycomb for property enhancement and design flexibility, Composite Structures, 280, (2022); Choi, J.

Subsequently, the impact mechanical properties of these gradient SSHs at various impact velocities are examined using numerical analysis. The results indicate that enhancing the initial stress peak and plateau stress of SSH, thereby improving its impact resistance and energy absorption rate, can be achieved through two modifications. Firstly, by configuring a layer with a smaller cell angle gradient at the impact end while utilizing a layer with a larger cell angle gradient at the bottom. Alternatively, by employing a layer with a larger wall thickness gradient at both the impact and fixed ends and a layer with a smaller wall thickness gradient in the middle. Furthermore, it has been observed that the deformation of dual gradient SSHs under dynamic loads is primarily governed by a thickness gradient. The results offer valuable insights that can be utilized in optimizing honeycomb structure design and investigating the mechanical properties influenced by the non-uniform distribution of honeycomb. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorption; Finite element simulation; Gradient design; Impact resistance; Star-shaped honeycomb","Biomechanics; Dynamic loads; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Stars; Angle gradients; Design Methodology; Energy absorption capacity; Finite elements simulation; Functional gradient; Gradient design; Star-shaped; Star-shaped honeycomb; Thickness gradients; Wall thickness; Design","Ruan, Xiaoli, Chiral constrained stent: Effect of structural design on the mechanical and intravascular stent deployment performances, Mechanics of Materials, 148, (2020); Ruan, Xiaoli, Mechanical Design of Antichiral-Reentrant Hybrid Intravascular Stent, International Journal of Applied Mechanics, 10, 10, (2018); Novak, Nejc, Compression and shear behaviour of graded chiral auxetic structures, Mechanics of Materials, 148, (2020); Liu, Jiayue, Energy absorption characteristics and stability of novel bionic negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb under oblique compression, Engineering Structures, 267, (2022); Zhong, Ru, Mechanical properties of concrete composites with auxetic single and layered honeycomb structures, Construction and Building Materials, 322, (2022); Wang, Lianchao, Latitude-and-longitude-inspired three-dimensional auxetic metamaterials, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 42, (2021); Lu, Huan, In-plane dynamics crushing of a combined auxetic honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 160, (2021); Li, Tiantian, Exploiting negative Poisson's ratio to design 3D-printed composites with enhanced mechanical properties, Materials and Design, 142, pp. 247-258, (2018); Ye, H.

A novel Double Arrowhead Wings Honeycomb (DAWH), inspired by Tilia Platyphylloswas, was proposed for arrangement in RAWH. The analytical models were derived with size factor n for honeycomb selection and design. The mechanical properties, energy absorption, compression response, structure efficiency, and deformation mode of RAWH were investigated by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Experiment (EXP), comparing with Roller Hexagonal Honeycomb (RHH), Roller Re-entrant Honeycomb (RRH), and Roller Solid. With particular calculation methods, the work energy absorption, engineering strain, and engineering stress were obtained within acceptable error compared to finite element analysis. The contact force of RAWH exceeded RHH, RRH and Solid about 1.7, 5, and 0.32 times, with a maximum of 15000 N. Further, the deformation modes of RAWH were discussed and recorded with “V” mode and “U” mode appearing special characteristics of enhancement and resilience. The equivalent Poisson's ratios for protective honeycombs were studied and described in the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) growth model with the phenomena of “Step Fluctuation”, “Inter-layer Progression” and “Step Stability”.

The vibration isolator is shown to be effective for low-frequency shock vibration attenuation. Numerical and experimental results are reported, considering a rectangular honeycomb plate as the primary structure, on which the device, consisting of a circular ABH plate with one or several impact masses, is attached. A numerical model is developed using a finite element space discretization combined with a conservative scheme in a penalty approach for the contact dynamics. The analysis shows that the device has broadband efficiency thanks to the combined effects of energy transfer due to impacts and high attenuation in mid and high-frequency range due to the ABH effect. A detailed parametric study underlines that the tuning of the linear fundamental frequency of the impact mass plays an important role. Besides, considering several impact masses is shown to improve the efficacy. An experimental setup is then used in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the device. The results confirm the vibration mitigation trends obtained from the numerical model that could then be used as a design tool for the attenuator.

The specimens for this experiment were manufactured by hot-press molding method. The acrylic transparent tube was utilized to accommodate water medium, pistons and specimen during experiment. The exponential decaying shock wave was simulated by accelerating the fly plate to impact the piston based on the one-stage light gas gun system. The incident velocity of the fly plate and process of the fluid-structure interaction response were monitored by high frame rate camera. In addition, the velocity of the shock wave in water was measured by transducers installed at different measuring points. The voltage signal of the dynamic overpressure collected by transducers was amplified by the charge amplifier and recorded by the oscilloscope. On the other hand, finite element software Abaqus/Explicit was applied to simulate the cavitation process of water domain and dynamic response of specimens. The experimental results and numerical results were in good agreement. The results indicated that the increase of the thickness of the fly plate had a certain effect on the propagation velocity of the shock wave, and the increase of the peak pressure would make the cavitation generation position close to the fluid-structure interface and make the cavitation duration longer.

The study analyzed the effects of ultrasonic characterization parameters on the cutting force, honeycomb wall width, and surface morphology. The results indicate that using LTUAM significantly reduced the cutting force and decreased the length and height of the burrs at an appropriate ultrasound amplitude. The spindle speed had the least impact on the width of the honeycomb wall, but increased with the longitudinal-torsional ultrasonic amplitude and feed rate. The maximum error between the simulated and experimental cutting force values was approximately 19%. The longitudinal amplitude and torsional amplitude were 3 and 5 μm, respectively, the length of burrs decreased by 52.7%, and there was less delamination and tearing damage. LTUAM proved to be beneficial in improving cutting performance. Compared with conventional milling (CM), LTUAM resulted in regular fiber fracture morphology and smaller fragments on the honeycomb surface. In addition, the high-frequency ultrasonic vibration promoted carbon fiber fracture and the surface roughness value under LTUAM was approximately 36.72% smaller than that of CM. Highlights: Ultrasonic milling mechanism of carbon honeycomb is studied. Kinematic simulation of the tool of carbon honeycomb was studied during LTUAM. LTUAM promotes the fracture of carbon fibers. A multi-edge micro-tooth LTUAM model was established of carbon honeycomb.

It is demonstrated that the CIP panel shows improved impact mitigation and energy absorption property under local impact. However, its overall displacement is significantly larger than that of the COP panel. Based on the impact behavior of COP and CIP panels, the hybrid two-layer structures (HOI and HIO) are designed. It is found that the HIO panel shows an increase in energy absorption of approximately 3% over the COP and CIP panels and a reduction in the overall displacement of at least 28% over the CIP panel. Moreover, HIO configuration with the thinner cell wall thickness of the upper core demonstrates improved impact mitigation. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Curved sandwich panel; in-plane honeycomb; multilayer curved sandwich structure; out-plane honeycomb; projectile impact","Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Cell array; Curved sandwich panel; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich panels; In-plane honeycomb; Local impacts; Multilayer curved sandwich structure; Out-plane honeycomb; Projectile impact; Sandwich panel; Multilayers","Liu, Dongrun, Experimental–numerical investigation of momentary discomfort in a high-speed train in varying wind speed conditions, Vehicle System Dynamics, 60, 4, pp. 1440-1459, (2022); Liu, Jia'An, Flexural properties of lightweight carbon fiber/epoxy resin composite sandwiches with different fiber directions, Materials Research Express, 9, 2, (2022); Lu, Zhaijun, A measurement method for the overturning coefficient of high-speed trains passing through complex terrain sections under strong wind conditions, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 234, 8, pp. 885-895, (2020); Proc Inst Mech Eng F J Rail Rapid Transit, (2019); Liu, Dongrun, Measurements of car-body lateral vibration induced by high-speed trains negotiating complex terrain sections under strong wind conditions, Vehicle System Dynamics, 56, 2, pp. 173-189, (2018); Luo, Yi, Sandwich panel with in-plane honeycombs in different Poisson's ratio under low to medium impact loads, Reviews on Advanced Materials Science, 60, 1, pp. 145-157, (2021); Lan, Xuke, A comparative study of blast resistance of cylindrical sandwich panels with aluminum foam and auxetic honeycomb cores, Aerospace Science and Technology, 87, pp. 37-47, (2019); Li, Chong, Nonlinear bending of sandwich beams with functionally graded negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb core, Composite Structures, 212, pp. 317-325, (2019); Tao, Qiangqiang, Energy absorption and impact behavior of composite sandwich panels under high-velocity spherical projectile, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 162, (2022); Usta, Fatih, Low-velocity impact resistance of composite sandwich panels with various types of auxetic and non-auxetic core structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 163, (2021)",""

This development presents significant challenges in terms of improving machining quality, requiring the use of specialized cutting tools and favorable cutting techniques. In this context, experimental studies have been carried out to highlight the characteristics of the milling of NHCs by rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM). However, the rapid motion of the cutting tool and the inaccessibility of the tool/part interface prevent the visualization of the chip formation process. For this purpose, a three-dimensional numerical model for milling the NHC structure using RUM technology was developed by Abaqus Explicit software. On the basis of this model, the components of the cutting force, the quality of the machined surface and the chip accumulation in front of the cutting tool were analyzed. The numerical results agree with the experimental tests, demonstrating that the use of RUM technology effectively reduces the cutting force components. An in-depth analysis of the influence of feed component F<inf>y</inf> on the quality of the generated surface was carried out, revealing that the surface quality improved with low values of feed component F<inf>y</inf>. Furthermore, the impact of ultrasonic vibrations on the accumulation of chips in front of the cutting tool is particularly optimized, in particular for large amplitudes. © 2024 by the authors.","chip size; finite element modeling; Nomex honeycomb composites (NHCs); rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM); surface quality","","Ui Haq, Saeed, DC breakdown characteristics of high temperature polymer films, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 13, 4, pp. 917-926, (2006); Yang, Charles Qixiang, Investigation of the flammability of different textile fabrics using micro-scale combustion calorimetry, Polymer Degradation and Stability, 95, 2, pp. 108-115, (2010); Foo, Choon Chiang, Mechanical properties of Nomex material and Nomex honeycomb structure, Composite Structures, 80, 4, pp. 588-594, (2007); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); Botelho, Edson Cocchieri, A review on the development and properties of continuous fiber/epoxy/aluminum hybrid composites for aircraft structures, Materials Research, 9, 3, pp. 247-256, (2006); Xu, Jie, Meso-scale cracks initiation of Nomex honeycomb composites in orthogonal cutting with a straight blade cutter, Composites Science and Technology, 233, (2023); Hu, Xiaoping, Research on curved surface forming of nomex honeycomb material based on ultrasonic NC cutting, Advanced Materials Research, 538-541, pp. 1377-1381, (2012); Zarrouk, Tarik, Modeling and numerical simulation of the chip formation process when machining Nomex, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 1, pp. 98-105, (2022); Zarrouk, Tarik, Analysis of friction and cutting parameters when milling honeycomb composite structures, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 13, 7, (2021); Zarrouk, Tarik, Simulated Study of the Machinability of the Nomex Honeycomb Structure, Journal of Manufacturing and Materials Processing, 7, 1, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

With the specially designed V-shape spokes, the NPT can achieve better supporting performance and aerodynamic characteristics.

In particular, the negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) property endows them with innovative mechanical properties and makes them promising for a wide range of applications. This paper proposes a modified double re-entrant honeycomb (MDRH) structure and explores its Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio through theoretical derivation and finite element analysis. Additionally, it discusses the relationship between these parameters and the concave angle. Furthermore, the deformation mode, nominal stress-strain curve, and specific energy absorption of this MDRH are investigated for different impact velocities and compared with traditional re-entrant honeycomb (TRH) materials. The results show that the MDRH honeycomb structure greatly widens the range of effective modulus and NPR values. At different impact velocities, the MDRH exhibits high plateau stress and specific energy absorption, indicating good impact resistance.

Though explosions on offshore structures are rare, their devastating impact cannot be understated. Blast walls, functioning as pivotal passive barriers, play a crucial role in protecting the topsides of these structures by dissipating explosive energy. Sandwich panel structures (SPS), with their lightweight attributes, enhanced bending rigidity and exceptional energy absorption, are a cost-effective countermeasure. This study introduces a groundbreaking design guideline, anchored in the LS-Dyna nonlinear finite-element method (NLFEM), tailored for hexagonal SPS offshore blast walls under explosive strains. Our rigorous numerical simulations, encompassing 450 varied scenarios, meticulously evaluated an array of geometric configurations and explosive strengths (spanning from 1 kg to 3 kg of TNT). From these simulations, crucial parameters affecting maximum mid-span plate deflection were discerned. In addition to these simulations, our research offers in-depth technical reviews, shedding light on the nuances of the subject. An empirical formula was subsequently formulated to anticipate this deflection, corroborating its efficacy by FE simulation outcomes.

Unlike the plate or block construction investigated in previous studies, this present study proposes a new type of configuration known as the fiber-reinforced hemispherical stacked sandwich (FRHSS) structure. The fabrication of this FRHSS is achieved through the utilization of the Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) process and its response under quasi-static compression load is analyzed through both simulation and experiment. It is found that the internal configuration design effectively determines the direction of contraction in the hemispherical construction when it is subjected to quasi-static compression load. Furthermore, the impact resistance of the FRHSS against projectile penetration is also assessed. Through a comparison of simulation and experimental results, it becomes evident that the Chang-Chang failure criterion can successfully model the penetration process. Finally, the influence of internal configuration on the penetration resistance of the structure is studied by finite element method. The results show that the internal configuration plays an important role in the ballistic limiting velocity and ballistic performance of the construction.

By mimicking the chemical structural formula of the TpPB-Fe coordination polymer, a new self-similar hierarchical honeycomb was proposed. With respect to the existing self-similar hierarchical honeycomb in the literature which was constructed by replacing every three-edge vertex of the regular hexagonal honeycomb with a smaller hexagon, the new one is created by setting the fractal position at the midpoint of the cell walls of the regular hexagonal honeycomb. What I am really curious about is the difference in mechanical properties between the two self-similar hierarchical honeycombs. Finite element (FE) model was first built and validated by comparing against the existing theoretical data. Subsequently, the in-plane crushing behaviors of the honeycombs under different impact velocities were fully investigated by FE simulations. The deformation modes, plateau stress as well as the energy absorption capability of the honeycombs were studied. Different macroscopic and microscopic deformation patterns between the two hierarchical honeycombs were observed. The plateau stress of the new hierarchical honeycomb is higher than that of both the existing counterpart and the basic regular hexagonal one. Under low- and medium-velocity impact loading, the new honeycomb with low fractal ratio (α) has superior energy absorption capability with respect to the existing counterpart and the basic regular hexagonal one. However, the new honeycomb will lose its advantage in energy absorption when the fractal ratio or the impact velocity is large. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Deformation mode; In-plane crushing behaviors; Plateau stress; Self-similar hierarchical honeycombs; Specific energy absorption","Crushing; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Crushing behaviors; Deformation modes; Energy absorption capability; Hexagonal honeycomb; Impact velocities; In-plane crushing behavior; Plateau stress; Self-similar; Self-similar hierarchical honeycomb; Specific energy absorption; Fractals","Ajdari, Amin, Hierarchical honeycombs with tailorable properties, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 49, 11-12, pp. 1413-1419, (2012); Fan, Hualin, Approaching perfect energy absorption through structural hierarchy, International Journal of Engineering Science, 130, pp. 12-32, (2018); Fratzl, Peter, Nature's hierarchical materials, Progress in Materials Science, 52, 8, pp. 1263-1334, (2007); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Haghpanah, Babak, Self-similar hierarchical honeycombs, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 469, 2156, (2013); Hu, Lingling, Mechanical behavior of hexagonal honeycombs under low-velocity impact - Theory and simulations, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 50, 20-21, pp. 3152-3165, (2013); Kooistra, Gregory W., Hierarchical corrugated core sandwich panel concepts, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 74, 2, pp. 259-268, (2007); Langseth, Magnus, Static and dynamic axial crushing of square thin-walled aluminium extrusions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 18, 7-8, pp. 949-968, (1996); Meza, Lucas R., Resilient 3D hierarchical architected metamaterials, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 37, pp. 11502-11507, (2015); Mousanezhad, Davood, Spiderweb honeycombs, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 66, pp. 218-227, (2015)",""

The panels are subjected to two-way bending under impact loads at the center, simulating applications like building cladding systems exposed to wind-borne debris. Nine large-scale panels were fabricated and subjected to impact loads; 412 tests were performed. Each panel was 1,220 mm × 1,220 mm with a nominal thickness of 80 mm. The main test parameters were core-to-face thickness ratio based on one, two, or three FFRP layers (core-to-face thickness ratios of 65.1, 32.6, and 21.7) and impact energy (50%, 70%, and 95% of failure energy). For each face thickness, three identical panels were fabricated and tested. The impact tests were performed using a 140-mm-diameter drop weight ranging from 10.5 to 20 kg, with a varying height of up to 3,250 mm. The results showed that the panels are susceptible to internal damage accumulating after impacts, such as core shear failure. Analyses of the test data showed that the impulse duration of a panel increased with an increase of damage. A finite-element model was also developed to predict the behavior of these panels under low-energy impacts. The model accounted for the nonlinear behavior of both the FFRP faces and foam cores. The model was used to perform a parametric study to examine the effect of core thickness, face thickness, and core density. It showed that impulse duration and maximum deflection increased with a decrease in face thickness, core density, and core thickness. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Flax; Impact; Impact; Natural fibers; Sandwich structures; Two-way","Fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Linen; Sandwich structures; Fiber-reinforced polymers; Fibre reinforced polymers; Flax fibres; Foam core; Impact; Impact loads; Large-scales; Sandwich panel; Two ways; Flax","Abrate, Serge, Localized impact on sandwich structures with laminated facings, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 50, 2, pp. 69-82, (1997); Akil Hazizan, Md, The low velocity impact response of foam-based sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 33, 3, pp. 193-204, (2002); Anderson, Todd A., Experimental investigation of low-velocity impact characteristics of sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 50, 3, pp. 239-247, (2000); Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics; ASTM ASTM D3039 D3039m, (2017); ASTM ASTM D3518 D3518m, (2018); Standard Test Method for Shear Properties of Sandwich Core Materials, (2018); Baley, Christophe, Influence of drying on the mechanical behaviour of flax fibres and their unidirectional composites, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 43, 8, pp. 1226-1233, (2012); Bambach, Mike R., Compression strength of natural fibre composite plates and sections of flax, jute and hemp, Thin-Walled Structures, 119, pp. 103-113, (2017); Bensadoun, Farida, Fatigue behaviour assessment of flax-epoxy composites, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 82, pp. 253-266, (2016)",""

The mesoscopic structure of such a foam plays a pivotal role in enhancing its outstanding protective performance. Numerical simulations permit us to explore the damage mechanism of its internal structure and the evolving characteristics of debris clouds. By adopting the three-dimensional Voronoi tessellation in conjunction with the algorithm of background mesh mapping, this study constructed mesoscopic finite element models that accurately reflect the internal randomness and variability in ligament width within the metallic foam. Subsequently, numerical simulations were executed employing the FE-SPH adaptive method within the LS-DYNA. Comparative experimental cases substantiated the validity of the simulations, and an exhaustive mesh sensitivity analysis was conducted. Optimizing results from these simulations following a normal impact, we delved into the propagation of stress waves within the foam core, alongside the subsequent internal structural damage. Furthermore, we explored the damage mechanism of foam sandwich panels subjected to hypervelocity impacts. According to the fragmentation process of the projectile and the evolution of debris clouds, it was discerned that the random internal structure of the foam engenders an asymmetric and skewed debris cloud, dispersing its energy and culminating in multiple concentrated particle clusters with a predilection towards a particular direction. Tracking the velocity fluctuations of these ‘dominant particles’ and the inflicted damage on the rear facesheet revealed that the agglomerated tiny fragments of the projectile are primarily responsible for perforating the rear facesheet. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Debris clouds; Foam core sandwich panels; Hypervelocity impact; Mesoscopic model of metallic foam","Debris; Honeycomb structures; Hydrodynamics; Mesh generation; Metal foams; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Sensitivity analysis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Damage mechanism; Debris cloud; Face sheets; Foam core sandwich panels; Hypervelocity impacts; Internal structure; Mesoscopic model of metallic foam; Mesoscopic modeling; Mesoscopics; Metallic foam; Projectiles","undefined, (2004); Meteoroid Debris Shielding, (2003); Spacecraft Environment Engineering, (2014); Astronomical Journal, (1947); Cour-Palais, Burton G., A multi-shock concept for spacecraft shielding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 10, 1-4, pp. 135-146, (1990); Christiansen, Eric L., Mesh double-bumper shield: A low-weight alternative for spacecraft meteoroid and orbital debris protection, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 14, 1-4, pp. 169-180, (1993); Christiansen, Eric L., Enhanced meteoroid and orbital debris shielding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 17, 1-3, pp. 217-228, (1995); Ryan, Shannon J., Hypervelocity impact testing of advanced materials and structures for micrometeoroid and orbital debris shielding, Acta Astronautica, 83, pp. 216-231, (2013); Destefanis, Roberto, Enhanced space debris shields for manned spacecraft, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 29, 1-10, pp. 215-226, (2003); Hypervelocity Impact Testing of Aluminum Foam Core Sandwich Panels, (2015)",""

Taking into account the core arrangements, the analytical model is formulated by employing an innovative yield criterion, to predict the impact force and deflection responses. The accuracy of the analytical predictions was confirmed through finite element (FE) results, and the influences of the core distribution, impact position, as well as core thickness on the impact behaviour of SPs were discussed. It is shown that the graded core SP exerts slightly inferior impact resistance than the uniform core SP. The closer the impact position is to the clamped boundary, the smaller the deflection of the bottom face-sheet and the greater the impact force. As the thickness of the core increases, the proportion of energy absorption attributed to the core also increases.

High-fidelity Finite Element (FE) models of the proposed sandwich structures are built, based on identical domains for unit cells. Impact performances of lattice structures are addressed for low (2 m/s) and high (5 m/s) impact velocities in three orthogonal directions. The parameters investigated for crashworthiness include impactor's penetration depth, von Mises stress distribution, edges deformation and dimensional stability. Numerical results demonstrate that, unlike PPR and NPR models, the Fish Cells ZPR model possesses greater lateral stability and structural integrity with minimal edge deformations in all three directions. This leads to reduced lateral impact transfer to adjacent components and localised damaged zones, increasing the life span of structural components while reducing maintenance and repair downtime.

Our comprehensive study delves into the impact resistance of these hybrid structures when subjected to high strain rate loading. To conduct our research, we employed selective laser melting (SLM) to fabricate TPMS samples based on AlSi10Mg, and we validated our finite element model through quasi-static compression experiments. By conducting numerical simulations, we analyzed the mechanical properties and deformation patterns of these structures under strain rates of 250s−1 and 1250s−1, comparing them to commonly used porous structures such as Honeycomb, FCC, and BCC. Through quantitative analysis utilizing various evaluation indexes, we effectively demonstrated how the design of hybrid structures enhances energy absorption. Furthermore, we discussed the impact of strain rate on the mechanical properties of these structures, and the Gibson-Ashby model accurately predicted the mechanical properties of partial structures.

Results show that increasing the amplitude and frequency of the perturbations generally decreases the flexural and transverse shear stiffness and yield strength. Local deformations in the perturbed cores indicate that imposing perturbations encouraged the development of localized deformations in the curved cell walls, which increased the perturbed cores' compliance. The transverse shear and flexural responses at the highest frequencies and amplitudes exhibited a very smooth and compliant behavior compared to the unperturbed cores.

Both complete and partial agglomeration states are considered using the Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka micromechanical model. The governing equations of motion are derived using Hamilton's principle, based on First Shear Deformation (FSD) plate theory and the finite element method. The sandwich plates exhibit an ultra-light characteristic, attributable to the auxetic honeycomb core layer, which possesses a negative Poisson's ratio, and are further reinforced by two laminated skin layers. The study examines the impact of various parameters, including the geometry of the auxetic honeycomb unit cell, the weight fraction of GPL, and the distribution of GPL on the natural frequency, displacement of the center point of the auxetic honeycomb core, and specific absorbed energy of the sandwich plate. The natural frequency decreases with increasing inclination angle, becoming less sensitive as the ratio λ1, increases. A 57.14% drop occurs for λ1 = 1 when the angle rises from 10° to 60°, while for λ1 = 1.5, 2, and 2.5, the reductions are 25.82%, 13.72%, and 9.23%, respectively. Adding 0.1% GPL without agglomeration raises the natural frequency by 237.85%, enhancing stiffness, but full agglomeration cuts this to 12.47%. The X-pattern has the strongest effect, and the O-pattern the least, with distribution patterns becoming more influential as GPL weight fraction rises. In the partial agglomeration state, performance is optimal when ξ = ζ. For a GPL weight fraction from 0.2% to 1%, displacement drops by 77.94% at ξ = ζ = 0.2 and by 71.68% at ξ = 0.2,ζ = 0.8. © 2026 World Scientific Publishing Company.","agglomeration; FSDT; GPL; lattice structure; Sector plate","Convergence of numerical methods; Crystal lattices; Gluing; Honeycomb structures; Laminating; Light absorption; Poisson distribution; Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Annular sector plate; Auxetic honeycomb cores; Face sheets; FSDT; Graphene nanoplatelets; Lattice structures; Negative Poisson ratio; Sandwich plates; Sector plates; Weight fractions; Poisson ratio","Shukla, Shivangi, Auxetic fibrous structures and their composites: A review, Composite Structures, 290, (2022); Jiang, Wei, Manufacturing, characteristics and applications of auxetic foams: A state-of-the-art review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 235, (2022); Choudhry, Niranjan Kumar, In-plane energy absorption characteristics of a modified re-entrant auxetic structure fabricated via 3D printing, Composites Part B: Engineering, 228, (2022); Zhang, Jianjun, Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured auxetic materials and structures: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 201, (2020); Guo, Yongguang, Deformation behaviors and energy absorption of auxetic lattice cylindrical structures under axial crushing load, Aerospace Science and Technology, 98, (2020); Choudhry, Niranjan Kumar, Enhanced energy absorption performance of 3D printed 2D auxetic lattices, Thin-Walled Structures, 186, (2023); Duc, Nguyen Dinh, New approach to study nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of sandwich composite cylindrical panels with auxetic honeycomb core layer, Aerospace Science and Technology, 70, pp. 396-404, (2017); Duc, Nguyen Dinh, Nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of sandwich composite plates with negative Poisson’s ratio in auxetic honeycombs, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 20, 6, pp. 692-717, (2018); Li, Y.

The deformation mode of the honeycomb under quasi-static compression is analyzed by numerical simulation, and the results are in good agreement with the experimental ones. The deformation modes, mechanical properties, and energy absorption characteristics of ROH along the impact and perpendicular directions gradient design are investigated under different velocities. The results indicated that the deformation mode of ROH is affected by gradient design along the direction of impact and impact speed. In addition, gradient design along the direction of impact can increase the initial peak stress of ROH and accelerate its densification phase. Gradient design perpendicular to the impact direction can enhance the energy absorption performance of ROH, especially for ROH, with wall thickness increasing from the inside outwards. Compared to ROH with uniform wall thickness at the same relative density, ROH with a gradient design can increase the plateau stress by over half.With the elevation of impact velocity, the plateau stress and specific energy absorption exhibit an upward trend, aligningwith the dynamic performance pattern observed in conventional honeycombs. The results can be used as a reference for the design and application of honeycomb and provide a new idea for developing more efficient and reliable energy-absorbing materials. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

Sandwich panels are effective structures for use in ship structures due to their lightweight yet robust nature. Sandwich panels used in ship structures have various core shapes, such as hexagonal, circular, and square, as needed. The sandwich panel structure can be widely implemented in ship construction, for example, on the deck, hull, and bulkhead of the ship's cabin. Hydrogen is an alternative fuel that can replace fossil fuels. In this modern era, hydrogen is high valuable energy commodity, so accidents involving carrier ships could have significant consequences. Hydrogen is produced from liquefied natural gas (LNG), so if a leak occurs, for instance, in a storage tank or fuel tank, it has the potential to lead to accidents such as fires. Corrosion is a significant concern for the maritime industry, as it can jeopardize the structural integrity of these vessels and pose substantial safety and environmental risks. In this research, FEM was utilized to model and simulate the effects of corrosion on hydrogen carrier ships when exposed to fire, considering various environmental and operational factors. Through a systematic investigation, it is aimed to gain insights into the impact of corrosion on ship structural components during fires, such as hulls and storage tanks. The result of this study will contribute to improving corrosion and fire mitigation strategies, ensuring the safety and longevity of hydrogen and LNG carrier ships, and supporting the sustainable transportation of hydrogen to meet global energy demands. No research has been conducted on the structural behavior resulting from hydrogen fires and corrosion simultaneously. To achieve this, it is assumed to use the corrosion properties of steel in heavily traveled ship routes such as the Panama Canal Zone, Barent Sea, North Sea, and Suez Canal Zone. This study utilized an approach by modeling corrosion using shell thickness in Abaqus Quasi-Static and applying boundary conditions in the form of temperature increase up to 800°C and subsequent cooling back to the initial temperature. At the maximum temperature, the most significant mid-span displacement occurred in the circular core sandwich panel, with a value of 4 mm. The axial force in the structure was inversely proportional to the mid-span displacement. In the case of the circular core sandwich panel, the axial force was 96 kN. The most resilient core type was hexagonal because it experiences the least deformation when compared to circular and square cores. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.","finite element analysis; fire-structure interaction; pitting corrosion; structural design; structural integrity","Accident prevention; Accidents; Corrosive effects; Crystal structure; Fires; Fossil fuels; Honeycomb structures; Hulls (ship); Hydraulic structures; Hydrogen storage; Liquefied natural gas; Pitting; Reliability analysis; Steel corrosion; Structural analysis; Structural integrity; Axial forces; Canal zone; Finite element analyse; Fire-structure interaction; Mid-span displacements; Performance; Sandwich panel; Sandwich panel structures; Ship structure; Storage tank; Finite element method","Tan, Khai Chen, Strategies of thermodynamic alternation on organic hydrogen carriers for hydrogen storage application: A review, Green Energy and Resources, 1, 2, (2023); Carbot-Rojas, D.

The most outrageous is a blast involving a highly charged explosive capable of destroying an entire region. Under the influence of an explosion, shock waves are generated, which cause a high impact on structures. A lightweight material like aluminum foam shows a better energy-absorbing capacity to withstand shock waves. They have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than steel. The Aluminum foam-based sandwich panel provides optimum shock resistance due to the inherent strength of Al. This paper aims to design and simulate a blast-resistant sandwich panel against charged TNT using steel as face sheets and aluminum foam (ALF) as the core of the sandwich panel. This research uses the nonlinear finite element method to model the system and carry out explicit dynamics simulation to extract the response and study the influence of various parameters. Henceforth, an extensive investigation is performed to demonstrate the potency of the suggested information against blast loading. The midpoint deflection on the face sheets concerning time, velocity, and energy of the face with the core of the sandwich is the characteristic variable for this analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Aluminum foam; Ansys Autodyn; Sandwich; Shock waves","Aluminum; Blast resistance; Explosives; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Aluminium foam; Ansys autodyn; AUTODYN; Blast loading; Face sheets; High impact; Sandwich; Sandwich panel; Shock-waves; Terror attacks; Shock waves","Zhu, Feng, Structural response and energy absorption of sandwich panels with an aluminium foam core under blast loading, Advances in Structural Engineering, 11, 5, pp. 525-536, (2008); Cheng, Yuansheng, Numerical investigation on the dynamic response of foam-filled corrugated core sandwich panels subjected to air blast loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 21, 3, pp. 838-864, (2019); Chen, Ganchao, Experimental and numerical analyses on the dynamic response of aluminum foam core sandwich panels subjected to localized air blast loading, Marine Structures, 65, pp. 343-361, (2019); Ackland, Kathryn, Deformation of polyurea-coated steel plates under localised blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 51, pp. 13-22, (2013); Li, Ying, Deformation and failure modes of aluminum foam-cored sandwich plates under air-blast loading, Composite Structures, 258, (2021); Blast Mitigation Capabilities of Aqueous Foam, (2006); Andami, Hosein, Performance assessment of rigid polyurethane foam core sandwich panels under blast loading, International Journal of Protective Structures, 11, 1, pp. 109-130, (2020); Theobald, M.

A dynamic cushioning coefficient method was proposed to characterize the cushioning performance of CHCs. The dynamic cushioning coefficient curve and minimum dynamic cushioning coefficient (MDCC) of CHCs with different impact velocities and structural parameters are obtained. The influence rules of structural parameters and impact velocities on the MDCC are analyzed; the deformation mode and transformation empirical formula are also obtained. The results show that when other parameters are constant, the MDCC of CHCs decreases with the increase of impact velocity, increases with the increase of wall thickness and side length ratio, and decreases with the increase of expansion angle. The theoretical analysis is consistent with the finite element results, which further verifies the reliability of the model.

Leveraging a comprehensive literature review and employing theoretical modeling and finite element analysis using ANSYS software, the study meticulously investigates the behavior of multilayer axisymmetric shells under varying internal pressure conditions. Critical parameters are identified, and the impact of design factors, including material properties, geometric parameters, and internal pressure, is quantitatively assessed using a rich digital dataset. In a series of model experiments, the study reveals specific numerical results that underscore the progressive nature of damage development in FDM-produced multilayer axisymmetric shells. Notably, under increasing internal pressure, stresses on the tank’s inner walls reach up to 27.5 MPa, emphasizing the critical importance of considering material properties in the design phase. The research also uncovers that the thickness of tank walls, while significant in resulting stresses, does not markedly impact the damage development mechanism. However, it places a premium on selecting rational parameters for the honeycomb system, including shell thickness, honeycomb height, honeycomb wall thickness, and honeycomb cell size, to minimize stress concentrations and enhance structural integrity. The inclusion of honeycomb structures in the tank design, as evidenced by specific results, provides enhanced thermal insulation properties. The research demonstrates that this design feature helps localize damage and mitigates the formation of significant trunk cracks, particularly along generative cracks. © 2024, Sumy State University.

The obtained finite element results showed that a decrease in the number of edges of the profile induced lower plastic work on the structure, which resulted in a lower stroke efficiency of the structure. Additionally, due to progressive collapse of the honeycomb inspired hexagonal structure, it exhibited a maximum displacement of ~ 96.4 mm, which resulted in poor stoke efficiency of 39.7%. While the conical and decagonal shaped structures displayed relatively higher stroke efficiency of 43.6% and 43.5%, respectively. Owing to the progressive axisymmetric mode of collapse, decagonal single cell thin walled taper tube structure displayed better total energy absorbing efficiency, hence it can be used in crumple zone of an automobile’s frame design.

The procedure of constrained-domain topology optimization is implemented with the aim of enhancing stiffness. The micromechanical finite element homogenization approach is used to evaluate the effective elastic-plastic properties of the CSPLs and their topologically optimized counterparts, TOCSPLs (Topologically Optimized Cuboidal Spherical Plate Lattices). The TOCSPLs demonstrate higher uniaxial, shear, and bulk moduli compared to the CSPLs, with an increase of 31%, 14%, and 36% respectively. Moreover, there is an increase in the yield strengths under uniaxial, shear, and hydrostatic loading conditions, with enhancements of 103%, 55%, and 62%, respectively. The topologies are additively manufactured through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) out of ABS thermoplastic material. The quasi-static compression experiments demonstrate the superiority of TOCSPL 111+100 over the other topologies in terms of uniaxial modulus. The suffix 111+100 denotes the crystallographic planar orientations in which the solid plate-like disks were formed within a cubic system. The topologies proposed herein outperform certain types of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface, honeycomb, truss-, and plate-based lattice materials. The proposed topologies offer a compelling justification for their utilization in applications that require load-bearing and impact absorption capabilities. © 2024 The Author(s).

Compression simulation was performed to validate the finite element model. Subsequently, a finite element model of the bio-honeycomb was developed to investigate its out-of-plane crashworthiness. The results show that the introduction of bionic cells and the RH cell walls produces significant interaction effects, with more severe plastic deformation at their intersections and the formation of more folded flaps in the cell walls.

The research explores various impactor head geometries, fiber orientations, and the number of composite layers on the panel facesheets. Three different impactor heads with flat, hemispherical, and conical shapes were used for experimental impacts. Numerical simulations were performed using Abaqus/Explicit finite element software, with damage initiation in the composite layers determined by the three-dimensional Hashin criterion. The results revealed that the conical-head impactor caused the highest energy absorption, accompanied by the greatest displacement and velocity changes. Among specimens with different fiber orientations, the 60° fiber layers exhibited a 9.41% and 8.45% higher maximum force compared to the 30° and 45° fiber layers, respectively. Furthermore, the study investigated the influence of the number of composite layers in the facesheets.

However, the structural integrity of conventional crash boxes is often compromised due to buckling deformations during collisions. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing functionally graded thickness (FGT) in hexagonal crash box design with honeycomb fillers to improve crashworthiness through multi-objective optimization. Finite element analysis using LS-DYNA was performed for axial and oblique impacts. Mesh sensitivity study indicated that constructing the FGT crash box with 41 layers yielded favourable outcomes, with simulation results differing by a mere 2.5% compared to experimental data. A surrogate model based on response surface methodology was employed to mathematically formulate the objective functions, which aimed to maximize specific energy absorption (SEA) and minimize initial peak crash force (IPF). Subsequently, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization was used to determine the optimal grading exponent of both outer and filler structures. The optimized FGT crash box demonstrated superior control over progressive deformation, exhibiting high SEA and reducing IPF compared to the uniform thickness crash box. Particularly, under oblique impact loads, using two grading exponents in optimizing the FGT crash box potentially achieved significant improvements in crashworthiness within the design procedure. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","Axial and oblique loadings; Crash box; Crashworthiness; Functionally graded thickness; Multi-objective optimization","Crashworthiness; Fillers; Grading; Honeycomb structures; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Axial loading; Buckling deformation; Crash box; Functionally graded; Functionally graded thickness; Impact energy; Multi-objectives optimization; Oblique impact; Oblique loading; Specific energy absorption; Multiobjective optimization","Shahsavari, Soodeh, Analysis of injuries and deaths from road traffic accidents in Iran: bivariate regression approach, BMC Emergency Medicine, 22, 1, (2022); Luján, Karen Viviana Pérez, Accidental injuries caused by automotive frontal collision, Latin American Journal of Solids and Structures, 18, 1, pp. 1-15, (2021); Repair of Vehicle Bodies, (2006); Kongwat, Suphanut, Safety Assessment and Crash Compatibility of Heavy Quadricycle under Frontal Impact Collisions, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 20, (2022); Li, Zhaokai, Crashworthiness and lightweight optimization to applied multiple materials and foam-filled front end structure of auto-body, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 9, 8, pp. 1-21, (2017); Xu, Xiang, Crashworthiness design of novel hierarchical hexagonal columns, Composite Structures, 194, pp. 36-48, (2018); Abdullah, N.

This article investigates the failure mechanisms of ASPs subjected to low-velocity impacts experimentally and numerically. Low-velocity impact tests are conducted at two energy levels to induce barely visible impact damage (BVID) and visible impact damage (VID). A non-linear finite element (FE) model is developed to elucidate the damage behavior and failure mechanisms of ASPs. The numerical results are compared with experimental data to validate the FE model. Additionally, a parametric study is undertaken to explore the failure mechanisms of ASPs subjected to penetration. This study also investigates the influence of impactor diameter, impactor angle, foam core thickness, face sheet stacking sequence, and face sheet thickness on impact response through numerical simulations.

The model comprised a three-dimensional (3D) cantilever beam equipped with an auxetic substrate bonded to a piezoelectric (PZT) point defect using an epoxy layer. The substrate used in this proposed energy harvester possesses an auxetic region responsible for generating auxetic behavior and concentrating stress in the PZT layer. The auxetic model called auxetic structure (AS)-II is inspired by ancient motifs and is designed based on the combination of several promising mechanisms, including reentrant, chiral, perforation, and honeycomb supercell. The finite element method is employed to create numerical models whose accuracy is confirmed by mesh convergence and available experimental data. A parametric study is conducted on the AS-II harvester to examine the influence of geometry and PZT material type on the harvested electrical power. Our research efforts stem from both mechanical and electrical circuit fields to fulfill the broadband design target within the desired ultra-low-frequency range of (Formula presented.) regardless of the resonance condition. As a result, the impact of other factors, such as load resistance, frequency, load amplitude, and bonding stiffness, on the PEH performance is further investigated. The reason behind such outstanding performance of AS-II is explained in terms of geometrical physics and stress distribution. The effect of geometrical dimensions on the auxetic behavior is also analyzed using Poisson’s ratio (PR) study. Subsequently, we demonstrate that this innovative adapter can advance the system’s performance in terms of harvested power and lightweight by a magnification factor of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) times that of a plain substrate and (Formula presented.) and 3.16 times that of a conventional auxetic harvester, respectively. The present harvester is strain controllable, where it can set PR between (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) resulting in robust PEH even if switching input vibration from high to low levels.

Additionally, 3D-finite element models compared normal and shear stresses in the splice material and the core/splice interface among the dovetail configurations considered. The study shows that depending on the dovetail joint detail, an ultimate strength increase between 13 and 51% is achieved compared to the strength from currently used straight joints. In terms of toughness, the dovetail specimens show a 2% to 35% higher toughness compared to the standard straight joints. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminum core; Connection; Core splice; Dovetail joints; Ductile core; Hexagonal core; Joint; Metal core; Sandwich; Shear behavior","Aluminum; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural design; Aluminum cores; Composite sandwich structure; Connection; Core splice; Dovetail joint; Ductile core; Hexagonal core; Metal core; Sandwich; Shear behaviour; Shear stress","Proceedings 23rd International Congress of Aeronautical Sciences, (2002); Wang, Wei, Influence of core splice to the mechanical behavior of sandwich plate, Materials Science Forum, 813, pp. 220-239, (2015); undefined, (2018); undefined; Qi, Jianan, Flexural behavior of an innovative dovetail UHPC joint in composite bridges under negative bending moment, Engineering Structures, 200, (2019); Guin, William E., Effects of core splice joint width on the performance of composite sandwich structures with honeycomb core: An experimental study, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 1, pp. 720-741, (2022); Aqel, Rawan, Experimental and numerical investigation of core splicing configurations in an advanced composite sandwich structural system, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 42, 23-24, pp. 1242-1251, (2023); Espinosa, Horacio Dante, Tablet-level origin of toughening in abalone shells and translation to synthetic composite materials, Nature Communications, 2, 1, (2011); Jaaranen, Joonas, Experimental and numerical investigations of two-way LVL–concrete composite plates with various support conditions, Engineering Structures, 256, (2022); Jeong, Gi-young, Predicting load-carrying capacity of dovetail connections using the stochastic finite element method, Wood and Fiber Science, 44, 4, pp. 430-439, (2012)",""

Therefore, the influence of five different distances between impact positions (DBIP) and three impact energies on compression after impact (CAI) strength are considered and discussed for honeycomb sandwich structure with composite face sheets in this paper. By comparing two typical impact characteristics, i.e., maximum impact force and displacement, the trend of CAI strength shows a turning-point, which is closely related to the size of the impactor. However, high impact energy (15 J) leads to damage in the bottom face sheet during the second impact, and the presence of damage in both top and bottom face sheet reduces CAI strength, resulting in the turning point of CAI strength not exist. It was observed that there is obvious buckling failure, and some cracks along the width direction from the impact point to the edge after CAI. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of double impacts and CAI behavior, a finite element (FE) model considering different DBIP is developed. In addition, the predicted fraction of energy absorbed by top face sheet, honeycomb core, and bottom face sheet is also obtained to reveal the relationship between the impact position interference and CAI strength. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","CAI; Double impacts; Interference mechanism; Sandwich","Compressive strength; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Bottom face; Compression after impact; Compression-after-impact strengths; Double impact; Face sheets; Impact positions; Interference mechanisms; Multiple impact; Sandwich; Turning-points; Sandwich structures","Zhang, Xiaoyu, Experimental and numerical investigation on damage behavior of honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 236, (2020); Wu, Yuan, Characterisation of damage mechanisms of GFRP-balsa sandwich under 4-point bending based on two-step clustering process in acoustic emission analysis, Composites Part B: Engineering, 260, (2023); Fu, Kunkun, Low-velocity impact behaviour of a shear thickening fluid (STF) and STF-filled sandwich composite panels, Composites Science and Technology, 165, pp. 74-83, (2018); Wang, Huihui, Low velocity impact penetration response of foam core sandwich panels with face sheets, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 173, (2023); Sun, Guangyong, On the structural parameters of honeycomb-core sandwich panels against low-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 216, (2021); Wang, Heran, Analytical study on the low-velocity impact penetration of the fully-clamped foam-core composite sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 224, (2021); Qin, Qinghua, On influence of face sheet distributions on low-velocity impact failure of metal honeycomb core sandwich plates, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Long, Shuchang, Failure analysis and modeling of foam sandwich laminates under impact loading, Composite Structures, 197, pp. 10-20, (2018); Qi, Jiaqi, Energy absorption characteristics of origami-inspired honeycomb sandwich structures under low-velocity impact loading, Materials and Design, 207, (2021); Sun, Mengqian, Surface and honeycomb core damage in adhesively bonded aluminum sandwich panels subjected to low-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 230, (2022)",""

Quasi-static compression experiments of 3D printed samples in different loading directions were carried out. Deformation modes and stress–strain response have been explored and identified. The corresponding finite element (FE) models were established and verified, and the dynamic crushing behaviors of RDAH were further investigated by FE simulations. The results show that RDAH has three typical deformation modes under different impact velocities. When subjected to quasi-static loading and low-velocity impact along the horizontal wall, two stress plateau regions of the stress–strain curves can be observed, while there is only one stress plateau when loaded perpendicular to the horizontal wall. Based on deformation modes, theoretical models of plateau stresses of RDAH under low-velocity and high-velocity impact were further established. The theoretical results of the plateau stresses agree well with the FE simulation results. The effects of impact velocity and geometric parameters on densification strain, Poisson's ratio and energy absorption were also discussed. The results show that the RDAH exhibits obvious negative Poisson's ratio effect in both directions. The energy absorption of RDAH is higher when loaded along the horizontal wall and can be 29.45 % higher than the traditional RH structure.

The amplitude of the sinusoidal wall, cell periodicity, and cell wall thickness were modulated in three layers across the structure (denoted as AG-CM, PG-CM, and WTG-CM, respectively). The influence of the different gradient parameters on the dynamic response of the CMs was analysed. The finite element method was used to explicitly simulate the deformation behaviour, dynamic shock stress, and energy absorption characteristics of the proposed structures at different impact speeds and directions. The initial peak stress in the face of the impact of the CM with a reasonable gradient setting was lower than that of the non-gradient CM. In contrast, its energy absorption was higher than that of the non-gradient CM. WTG-CM exhibited the highest energy absorption for a low-speed impact (7 m/s). For a medium and high speed impacts (35 m/s and 70 m/s), AG-CM exhibited the highest energy absorption in the face of positive gradient impact, whereas WTG-CM exhibited the highest energy-absorbing energy when impacting against the gradient. Under similar impact rates, the energy absorption energy of the different CMs varied by 32.1%. For the same CM, the maximum difference in absorption energy between shock modes was 33.8%. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","energy absorption; gradient honeycomb; in-plane impact; Negative Poisson ratio","Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Absorption characteristics; Absorption energies; Cell walls; Cellular material; Energy absorption capacity; Gradient honeycomb; High-energy absorption; In-plane impact; Negative Poisson ratio; S ratio; Energy absorption","Bonfanti, Alessandra, Elastoplastic response and recoil of honeycomb lattices, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 71, pp. 77-88, (2018); Auxetic Materials and Structures, (2015); Mater Sci Technol, (2000); Galehdari, S.

This paper focuses on the theoretical and numerical study of the in-plane dynamic crushing response of RHC and the reinforced honeycomb structure with one layer of reinforcement and one layer of non-reinforcement(1 + 1RHC). The 1 + 1RHC was fabricated with a welding method. A displacement-controlled in-plane compressive load was applied to the 1 + 1RHC specimens. Three different deformation modes were monitored at varying impact velocities: low-speed, medium-speed, and high-speed modes. The deformation modes maps were developed to reveal the extent of effects by impact velocity and relative density. For 1 + 1RHC, two distinct plateau stress regions were identified at low-velocity impact loading. Additionally, the first plateau stress value of the 1 + 1RHC structure is 180.4% higher than that of structures with two platform stresses, and the second platform stress value is 71.0% higher than that of structures with two platform stresses. The 1 + 1RHC structure exhibits superior energy absorption and negative Poisson's ratio performance. The paper also discusses the impact of cell wall thickness, angle, and velocity on the crushing strength of both RHC and 1 + 1RHC. The results obtained by theoretical methods align well with that obtained from finite element simulations. © 2023","Impact; Plateau stress; Reinforced honeycomb structure","Crushing; Displacement control; Energy absorption; Reinforcement; Stress analysis; Compressive loads; Deformation modes; Impact; Impact velocities; In-plane dynamic crushing; Mechanical potential; Plateau stress; Reinforced honeycomb structure; Stress values; Welding method; Honeycomb structures","Zeng, Chengjun, Compression behavior and energy absorption of 3D printed continuous fiber reinforced composite honeycomb structures with shape memory effects, Additive Manufacturing, 38, (2021); Yang, Chenguang, High thermal insulation and compressive strength polypropylene microcellular foams with honeycomb structure, Polymer Degradation and Stability, 183, (2021); Nazir, Aamer, A state-of-the-art review on types, design, optimization, and additive manufacturing of cellular structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 104, 9-12, pp. 3489-3510, (2019); Zhong, Ru, Mechanical properties of concrete composites with auxetic single and layered honeycomb structures, Construction and Building Materials, 322, (2022); Zhou, Hui, Composite energy-absorbing structures combining thin-walled metal and honeycomb structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit, 231, 4, pp. 394-405, (2017); Kholoosi, Farshid, Design, optimisation and analysis of a helmet made with graded honeycomb structure under impact load, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 24, 6, pp. 645-655, (2019); Zhang, Huizhong, Rigidity analysis and mechanical properties of programmable origami tubes, Mechanics Research Communications, 132, (2023); Yu, Xianglong, Mechanical metamaterials associated with stiffness, rigidity and compressibility: A brief review, Progress in Materials Science, 94, pp. 114-173, (2018); Surjadi, James Utama, Mechanical Metamaterials and Their Engineering Applications, Advanced Engineering Materials, 21, 3, (2019); Wei, Yuchen, Topological study about failure behavior and energy absorption of honeycomb structures under various strain rates, Defence Technology, 24, pp. 214-227, (2023)",""

Initially, Finite Structured Acoustic Element Analysis (FE) was employed to identify the natural frequencies arising from exposure to high noise levels in the sandwich panel. Subsequently, the outputs of the FE model (comprising 224 configurations) were used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model, using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The developed ANN model was then utilized to assess the impact of various parameters, including changes in inner cell angles (−45 to +45°), alterations in material composition, variations in skin thickness, and total mass, on the transmission characteristics of the sandwich structure. The results generated by the ANN model closely align with those obtained from the numerical model, exhibiting a small error tolerance of 0.483 and a remarkable correlation coefficient of 0.99798. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Artificial neural network; composite face sheet; finite element analysis; honeycomb cellular structure; natural frequencies","Architectural acoustics; Cellular automata; Honeycomb structures; Natural frequencies; Sandwich structures; Artificial neural network modeling; Cellular structure; Cellulars; Composite face sheet; Composite faces; Face sheets; Finite element analyse; Honeycomb cellular structure; Predictive models; Sandwich panel; Finite element method","Sahu, Santosh Kumar, A Brief Review on Advanced Sandwich Structures with Customized Design Core and Composite Face Sheet, Polymers, 14, 20, (2022); Fan, Jinbo, Experimental Investigation on the Low-Velocity Impact Response of Tandem Nomex Honeycomb Sandwich Panels, Polymers, 15, 2, (2023); Sancaktar, Alican, Investigation of SPH Modelling Technique for Nomex Honeycomb on Sandwich Structure Subjected to Low Velocity Impact, (2023); Wowk, Diane D., An experimental and numerical investigation of core damage size in honeycomb sandwich panels subject to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 254, (2020); Li, Xin, Dynamic response of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels under foam projectile impact, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 25, 8, pp. 637-646, (2018); Zhu, Xiujie, Three-point bending characteristics of all-composite sandwich panels with different core configurations, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 15, pp. 3289-3308, (2024); Hohe, Jörg, Advances in the structural modeling of elastic sandwich panels, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 11, 4-5, pp. 395-424, (2004); Yang, Jinshui, Dynamic crushing behavior of multi-layered hybrid foam-filled composite graded lattice sandwich panels, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 27, pp. 6694-6704, (2022); Griese, David, The effect of honeycomb core geometry on the sound transmission performance of sandwich panels, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 137, 2, (2015); Kaidouchi, Hicham, Vibro-acoustic analysis of the sound transmission through aerospace composite structures, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 30, 19, pp. 3912-3922, (2023)",""

A new objective function based on the European Standard has been developed in order to improve crash cushions capabilities while avoiding peak deceleration by using a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm.

To estimate the force–deformation responses of density-graded cellular materials efficiently without resorting to modelling individual cells, a constitutive model based on local transverse isotropy is adopted. Metallic Voronoi honeycomb-like specimens with cell sizes that vary with position, are fabricated via 3D printing, to represent a density-graded cellular material with local transverse isotropy that varies with position. From quasi-static compression tests and cell-based finite element (FE) simulations, the influence of relative density on the continuum constitutive model is investigated and demonstrated to be significant. The model is then used to predict the global stress–strain response and deformation of cellular materials with positive and negative density-gradients, defined along the loading direction, subjected to uniaxial quasi-static compression, quasi-static indentation, and dynamic compression. The results show that for quasi-static compression, severe plastic deformation progresses from the low relative density region to the high relative density region; however, impact loading and indentation of negative density-gradient Voronoi honeycombs generates two zones of gross deformation – in the vicinity of the applied load and the opposite lower density end.

In this paper, the design of three new aluminum alloy rotating thin-walled structures (NRTS) are examined. These structures combine common concave structures and rotating, rigid-body structures. The purpose of this study is to solve the problem of the poor energy absorption capacity of rotating, rigid-body structure due to small deformation and to provide a reference for honeycomb mechanism designs. The Young’s modulus, the critical velocity, and the platform stress of the NRTS structure are derived from theoretical analysis. The dynamic response of the NRTS structure at different impact velocities is investigated using finite element simulation software. The results show that the rotating, thin-walled recessed honeycomb (RTRH) increases the plateau stress by 124% and 51% as compared to rotating, thin-walled square tubes (RTSTs) and the re-entrant hexagonal structure (RH), respectively; the rotating, thin-walled quadruple-arc honeycomb structure (RTQH) increases the SEA by 21% and 20% as compared to the RTST and RH, respectively; and the rotating thin-walled double-arc honeycomb structure (RTDH) increases the CEF by 54% and 51% as compared to the RTST and RH, respectively. During the study, it was demonstrated that NTRS also exhibits good energy absorption capacity. Then, the effect of rotation angle on the energy absorption performance was analyzed. The cell and wall thickness of the NTRS structure were optimized according to the gradient theory. It was proved that the gradient optimized structure has better energy absorption performance as compared to the uniform structure. © 2023 by the authors.","energy absorbing structure; gradient optimisation; impact resistance; rotating rigid structure; thin-walled","","Acta Mater Compos Sin, (2023); Yang, Yan, Energy absorption characteristics of a super hexagonal honeycomb under out-of-plane crushing, Thin-Walled Structures, 189, (2023); Yin, Qianfeng, Analysis of heat transfer and thermal ablation of honeycomb sandwich composite structure under laser irradiation, Qiangjiguang Yu Lizishu/High Power Laser and Particle Beams, 35, 8, (2023); J Wuhan Univ Sci Technol, (2023); Wang, Weijing, Energy absorption characteristics of a lightweight auxetic honeycomb under low-velocity impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 185, (2023); Morin-Martinez, Armando A., The quest for a bidirectional auxetic, elastic, and enhanced fracture toughness material: Revisiting the mechanical properties of the BeH2 monolayers, Journal of Computational Chemistry, 44, 3, pp. 248-255, (2023); Li, Zichuan, Improving thermomechanical properties of cracked brittle honeycombs by negative Poisson's ratio effect, Composite Structures, 266, (2021); Liu, Yangzuo, Ballistic performance of double-arrow negative Poisson′s ratio structure, Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology, 45, 2, pp. 197-207, (2023); Du, Yixian, Topological design optimization of lattice structures to maximize shear stiffness, Advances in Engineering Software, 112, pp. 211-221, (2017); Zhong, Ru, Mechanical properties of concrete composites with auxetic single and layered honeycomb structures, Construction and Building Materials, 322, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

This study investigates the impact of different core topologies on the energy absorption capability of 3D-printed sandwich panels. Triply periodic minimal surfaces-based lattice structures and bioinspired spherical closed-cell foam structures were designed and compared against a traditional honeycomb structure to find the most suitable core topology. The fused deposition modeling technique was used to print samples in polylactic acid. The mechanical behavior of the 3D printing material was comprehensively characterized through a uniaxial tensile test. The sandwich panels were subjected to low-velocity impact loads to determine the dependence of their mechanical properties’ responses on their topological features. Deformation mechanisms were investigated experimentally and numerically using ANSYS. The impact of cellular core topologies on deformation mechanisms, multi-hit (and impact location), and energy absorption capabilities demonstrated the possibility of enhancing mechanical performance of the panels. It is found that the sandwich panels with Tetra Radial and Schwarz P core topologies exhibit higher performance, denoted by higher dynamic energy absorption (up to 11% and 16%, respectively, for the 1st impact) and stiffness (up to 42%, and 43%, respectively, for the 1st impact) than the honeycomb structure (with a constant relative density). Significant enhancements in energy absorption, particularly in Schwarz P and Mono Radial panels compared to the previously reported Octet core structure, offer valuable insights for lightweight, durable 3D-printed sandwich structures, with broad applications in multifunctional industries and future trends in materials engineering, promising applications in aerospace, automotive, and construction for the development of weight-efficient, structurally robust materials. © 2023","3D-printed sandwich panels; Core topology; Energy absorption; Finite element modeling; Low-velocity impact test; Multi-hit capability","3D printing; Biomechanics; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Tensile testing; 3d-printed sandwich panel; Core topology; Deformation mechanism; Element models; Energy absorption capability; Finite element modeling; Low velocity impact test; Multi-hit; Multi-hit capability; Sandwich panel; Topology","Schaedler, Tobias A., Architected Cellular Materials, Annual Review of Materials Research, 46, pp. 187-210, (2016); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Imbalzano, Gabriele, A numerical study of auxetic composite panels under blast loadings, Composite Structures, 135, pp. 339-352, (2016); Sharaf, Tarek, Experimental investigation of large-scale cladding sandwich panels under out-of-plane transverse loading for building applications, Journal of Composites for Construction, 15, 3, pp. 422-430, (2011); Lurie, Sergey A., Design of the corrugated-core sandwich panel for the arctic rescue vehicle, Composite Structures, 160, pp. 1007-1019, (2017); Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids, MRS Bulletin, 28, 4, pp. 270-274, (2003); Jakobsen, Johnny, New peel stopper concept for sandwich structures, Composites Science and Technology, 67, 15-16, pp. 3378-3385, (2007); Sugiyama, Kentaro, 3D printing of composite sandwich structures using continuous carbon fiber and fiber tension, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 113, pp. 114-121, (2018); Wadley, Hayden N.G., Fabrication and structural performance of periodic cellular metal sandwich structures, Composites Science and Technology, 63, 16, pp. 2331-2343, (2003); Xiong, Jian, Sandwich Structures with Prismatic and Foam Cores: A Review, Advanced Engineering Materials, 21, 1, (2019)",""

The results showed that the decrease in the inclination angle of the outer walls of pyramid-shaped cells and the bidirectional-cell design can both improve the specific energy absorption of the helmet, and that the bidirectional staggered rectangular frustum helmet has the highest specific energy absorption, 2.7 times that of the gradient lattice or 1.3 times that of the honeycomb helmet.

Based on a recently developed composite projectile to simulate combined shock and single fragment impact loading, the performance of aluminum honeycomb core sandwich panels (HCSPs) against combined loading is methodically examined. The achieved results reveal that the combined loading exhibits a synergistic effect compared to the single loading, i.e., increased damage of the sandwich panel and enhanced perforation resistance of the sandwich panel. After that, a three-dimensional finite element simulation is performed to explore the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effect. Numerical analysis indicates that the increased damage is a result of perforation-induced reduction of load-carrying capacity of sandwich panel, while the enhanced perforation resistance is the result of deflecting-induced perforation time delay of the perforation process. Finally, the parametric investigation of sandwich geometries such as asymmetric face sheets, core density, and core height is comprehensively conducted. The gained results reveal that both performance and synergistic effect due to combined loading are sensitive to these parameters. © 2023","Combined loading; Sandwich panel; Synergistic effect; Underlying mechanism","Aluminum; Honeycomb structures; Loading; Aluminium honeycomb; Combined loading; Fragment impacts; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact loadings; Performance; Sandwich panel; Shock loadings; Synergistic effect; Underlying mechanism; Sandwich structures","Wallace, Duncan B., Improvised explosive devices and traumatic brain injury: The military experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, Australasian Psychiatry, 17, 3, pp. 218-224, (2009); Castanié, B., Discrete modeling of the crushing of nomex honeycomb core and application to impact and post-impact behavior of sandwich structures, Solid Mechanics and its Applications, 192, pp. 427-489, (2013); Proc Conf Materials in Oceanic Environment Euromat 98, (1998); Nyström, Ulrika, Numerical studies of the combined effects of blast and fragment loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 8, pp. 995-1005, (2009); Grisaro, Hezi Y., Characteristics of combined blast and fragments loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 116, pp. 51-64, (2018); Elveli, Benjamin Stavnar, On the strength–ductility trade-off in thin blast-loaded steel plates with and without initial defects — An experimental study, Thin-Walled Structures, 171, (2022); Yu, Runpei, Dynamic response of fully-clamped steel plate under laboratory-simulated sequential fragment impact and blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 182, (2023); Zhang, Changzai, Numerical investigation of the response of I-core sandwich panels subjected to combined blast and fragment loading, Engineering Structures, 151, pp. 459-471, (2017); Zhang, Pan, Experimental investigation into the synergetic damage of foam-filled and unfilled corrugated core hybrid sandwich panels under combined blast and fragment loading, Composite Structures, 299, (2022); Cai, Sipei, Experimental study on failure mechanisms of sandwich panels with multi-layered aluminum foam/UHMWPE laminate core under combined blast and fragments loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 159, (2021)",""

This paper introduces arched ribs to the classical re-entrant honeycomb (RH) as reinforced structures, and then its energy absorption is improved by simultaneously utilizing the reinforced structures and the auxetic deformation of RHs. Herein, the in-plane crashing response of reinforced RHs (RRH) under different impact velocities is investigated with finite element methods verified against the quasi-static compression experiment of 3D-printed RRH specimens. By introducing arched structures, the deformation of RHs becomes more stable and regular, and two plateau stresses are produced in the stress-strain curves of RRHs. Benefiting from the stacking deformation of RRHs and pure compression characteristic of catenary arches, the second plateau stress of all-reinforced RHs (ARH) is 3.8 times higher than the first one. Two plateau stresses of ARHs are derivated theoretically with a relative error of less than 7 %. Furthermore, a parametric study is performed to explore the effect of impact velocities, thicknesses, and the height of arched ribs on the crashing response of RRHs.

Moreover, it is crucial to emphasize the significant increase in the risk of collapse in parking structures subjected to vehicle collisions, primarily owing to their heightened dynamic response and low required bearing capacity. Consequently, to prevent vehicles from directly crashing on the columns, besides providing an alternate load path, urgent implementation of protective measures utilizing energy-absorbing materials is necessary for parking structures. This study proposes a honeycomb panel-based (HP) protective device for steel parking structures aimed at absorbing energy and mitigating damage resulting from vehicle collisions. A simplified multi-scale simulation, considering reasonable material models and boundary conditions, is employed to study the performance of parking structures under transverse impact. The deformation patterns, impact loads, transverse deflections, internal energies, and horizontal reactions are compared for the parking structures with and without the HP protective devices. Innovatively, a classical progressive collapse loading scheme is employed to simulate the vertical residual resistance of the beam-column substructure after the transverse impact. Finally, a comprehensive investigation is conducted on the effects of critical parameters of HP protective device. The results demonstrate that a properly designed HP protective device can significantly enhance the resistance of parking structures to transverse impact, thereby effectively mitigating the risk of progressive collapse in such structures after impact. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Finite element analysis; Honeycomb panel; Parking structure; Progressive collapse; Transverse impact","Accidents; Honeycomb structures; Structural dynamics; Vehicles; A: Honeycomb; Finite element analyse; Honeycomb panels; Parking structure; Progressive collapse; Protective devices; Public buildings; Transverse impact; Urban parking; Vehicles collision; Finite element method","Kang, Hyungoo, Progressive Collapse of Steel Moment Frames Subjected to Vehicle Impact, Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, 29, 6, (2015); Xu, Xiuchen, Vehicle collision with RC structures: A state-of-the-art review, Structures, 44, pp. 1617-1635, (2022); Yu, Zhaolong, A review of structural responses and design of offshore tubular structures subjected to ship impacts, Ocean Engineering, 154, pp. 177-203, (2018); Chen, Tianli, Dynamic behaviors of double-column RC bridge subjected to barge impact, Ocean Engineering, 264, (2022); Karim, Mohammed R., Impact of the Boeing 767 Aircraft into the World Trade Center, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 131, 10, pp. 1066-1072, (2005); Qu, Y.

The conventional footpad is typically designed with an aluminum honeycomb structure that dissipates energy through plastic deformation. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in providing cushioning and energy absorption becomes significantly compromised when the structure is crushed, rendering it unusable for reusable landers in the future. This study presents a methodology for designing and evaluating structural energy absorption systems incorporating recoverable strain constraints of shape memory alloys (SMA). The topological configuration of the energy absorbing structure is derived using an equivalent static load method (ESL), and three lightweight footpad designs featuring honeycomb-like Ni-Ti shape memory alloys structures and having variable stiffness skins are proposed. To verify the accuracy of the numerical modelling, a honeycomb-like structure subjected to compression load is modeled and then compared with experimental results. Moreover, the influence of the configurations and thickness distribution of the proposed structures on their energy absorption performance is comprehensively evaluated using finite element simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed design approach effectively regulates the strain threshold to maintain the SMA within the constraint of maximum recoverable strain, resulting in a structural energy absorption capacity of 362 J/kg with a crushing force efficiency greater than 63%. © 2023, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.","Deep space exploration lander; Design method; Footpad; Reusable energy absorption structure; Shape memory alloy (SMA)","Design; Honeycomb structures; Interplanetary flight; Nickel alloys; Shape optimization; Shape-memory alloy; Space research; Titanium alloys; Deep space exploration lander; Deep-space exploration; Design method; Energy absorption capability; Energy absorption structure; Footpad; Recoverable strain; Reusable energy absorption structure; Shape memory alloy; Structural energies; Energy absorption","Arney, Dale C., Sustaining human presence on Mars using ISRU and a reusable Lander, (2015); Robertson, Bradford E., A conceptual design study for an unmanned, reusable cargo lunar lander, Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC, 2019-October, (2019); Carabellese, Davide, Preliminary design of a reusable lunar lander/ascender for on-orbit refueling, pp. 1-15, (2020); Huang, Bo, Research on impact process of lander footpad against simulant lunar soils, Shock and Vibration, 2015, (2015); Wang, Chen, The design and dynamic analysis of a lunar lander with semi-active control, Acta Astronautica, 157, pp. 145-156, (2019); Xu, Xiang, Searching superior crashworthiness performance by constructing variable thickness honeycombs with biomimetic cells, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 235, (2022); Zhang, Yong, Load characteristics of triangular honeycomb structures with self-similar hierarchical features, Engineering Structures, 257, (2022); Li, Hui, Amplitude-dependent damping characteristics of all-composite sandwich plates with a foam-filled hexagon honeycomb core, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 186, (2023); Li, Hui, Nonlinear vibrations of all-composite sandwich plates with a hexagon honeycomb core: Theoretical and experimental investigations, Composite Structures, 305, (2023); Selivanov, V.

In the present work, a nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to study the mechanical behavior of preloaded aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures with carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) face sheets under LVI. Johnson–Cook model is adopted to identify the damage of aluminum honeycomb core; a progressive damage constitutive model and a bilinear cohesive zone model are employed to capture the intra-laminar response and inter-laminar delamination of CFRP face sheets. The effects of preload condition and impact position on the LVI resistance of sandwich plate are analyzed in detail. Besides, the energy absorption properties and damage characteristics of sandwich plate during the impact are examined. The results show that tension preload reduces the damage area of the core and the compression preload causes the sandwich plate to bend and deform when it is impacted.

In this work, intersected corrugated sandwich panels (ICSPs) of the same thickness as regular corrugated sandwich panels (RCSPs) were fabricated using simple but efficient slotting and interlocking methods. The impact response and damage mechanisms of ICSPs and RCSPs with different impact locations under various impact energy were obtained through a series of low-velocity impact (LVI) tests. The results show that impact on the long span causes greater structural damage to the RCSPs, while the ICSPs can maintain good integrity after unloading. In the case of 200 J impact energy, the peak force of ICSPs is 15.3 % and 21.4 % higher than that of RCSPs-SS and RCSPs-LS respectively, and has a comparable energy absorption capacity to RCSPs. The finite element (FE) model was established to analyse the response process of the structure and to explore the effect of staggered angles on the deformation and load-carrying capacity. The ICSPs are considered to have better impact resistance and could provide a new idea for the protection structure design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic response; Finite element analysis; Intersected corrugated sandwich panels; Low-velocity impact; Thermoplastic composite","Aerospace applications; Honeycomb structures; Marine applications; Reinforced plastics; Sandwich structures; Structural design; Thermoplastics; Unloading; Composite sandwich panels; Corrugated core; Finite element analyse; Impact energy; Impact response; Intersected corrugated sandwich panel; Low velocity impact; Protection structure; Sandwich panel; Thermoplastic composite; Finite element method","Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Tian, Y.

The effects of different gradient parameters on the deformation mode and extrusion response were discussed, respectively. The results show that different grading parameters have different effects on the crushing behavior of honeycombs for in-plane and out-of-plane crushing. Compared with out-of-plane crushing, the influence of the hierarchical structure on the in-plane crushing deformation mode and the increase in platform stress are much larger. Compared with the ordinary honeycombs, changing the substructure angle does not necessarily improve the platform stress of the honeycomb. From the perspective of platform stress, the layered structure has different effects on the improvement of honeycomb energy absorption; the maximum platform stress of the honeycomb is increased. © 2023 by the authors.","dynamic crushing; energy absorption capacity; in-plane impact; negative Poisson’s ratio; out-of-plane impact; re-entrant honeycombs","Crushing; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Crushing behaviors; Deformation modes; Dynamic crushing; Energy absorption capacity; In-plane impact; Negative poisson’s ratio; Out-of-plane; Out-of-plane impact; Re-entrant honeycomb; S ratio; Grading","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Fang, Jianguang, On design optimization for structural crashworthiness and its state of the art, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 55, 3, pp. 1091-1119, (2017); Xu, Shanqing, Experimental study of the out-of-plane dynamic compression of hexagonal honeycombs, Composite Structures, 94, 8, pp. 2326-2336, (2012); Wierzbicki, Tomasz, Crushing analysis of metal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 1, 2, pp. 157-174, (1983); Zhang, J., The out-of-plane properties of honeycombs, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 34, 6, pp. 475-489, (1992); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); Baroutaji, Ahmad, On the crashworthiness performance of thin-walled energy absorbers: Recent advances and future developments, Thin-Walled Structures, 118, pp. 137-163, (2017); Ajdari, Amin, Dynamic crushing and energy absorption of regular, irregular and functionally graded cellular structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 3-4, pp. 506-516, (2011)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

However, due to stress concentration, variable load and impact, the critical components of non-pneumatic tires may still fail. In this paper, the influence of local damage on the static and dynamic characteristics of the honeycomb non-pneumatic tire was studied by using the finite element method. Firstly, according to the working principle and structural characteristics of the honeycomb tire, the finite element model of the tire was established, and its static characteristics in good condition state were analyzed. Then, the failure mode and danger area of the honeycomb tire were discussed, and the vulnerable parts of the honeycomb tire were determined. Finally, the static and dynamic characteristics of the honeycomb non-pneumatic tire in local damage conditions were simulated. The tire stiffness, grounding pressure, and vibration characteristics with different damage degrees were analyzed qualitatively. The results show that the spoke damage has different effects on the static and dynamic characteristics of non-pneumatic tires, including vertical stiffness, ground pressure and natural frequency.

This paper proposes a novel floating composite honeycomb anti-collision structure to reduce damage caused by ship-OWT high-energy collisions. The typical collision scenarios are conducted to investigate the damage analysis of anti-collision structures and the dynamic response of OWT with and without anti-collision structures via ABAQUS/Explicit. Regarding the configuration of the composite honeycomb anti-collision structure, the elastic-plastic theory of sandwich beams is proposed and an elastic-plastic analysis on the sandwich wall honeycomb core structure is performed to investigate its dissipation mechanism and obtain homogeneous material parameters of the cells. The homogenization parameters are incorporated into the ship-OWT anti-collision analysis to evaluate their applicability. The collision simulation results demonstrate that the proposed anti-collision structure is capable of effectively absorbing 80% of the initial kinetic energy and significantly reducing the dynamic response of the structure. In elastic-plastic analysis, the proposed elastic-plastic theory of sandwich beams effectively addresses the elastic-plastic behavior of honeycomb with sandwich walls, yielding results consistent with the stress-strain curve obtained from finite element analysis (FEA). In the coupled analysis, the obtained parameters of the homogenized honeycomb validate its effectiveness and enhance computational efficiency.

However, the behavior of such structure subjected to low-velocity impact possesses a localized damage characteristic. The objective of this paper is to systematically investigate the influence of impact energy and structural parameters on the damage behavior and failure mechanism of full-scaled composite sandwich panels under localized impact. Tests are carried out by impacting at the middle of the specimens with various energies. A finite element model with localized impact framework, considering complicated damage mechanisms, is developed to predict the impact responses, failure patterns, and energy absorption. The validation of the framework is achieved by comparing numerical results with experimental data. Moreover, a comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted with focus placed on the impact energy, foam-core height, stacking sequences of the laminated facesheets, and angle of impact trajectory. The results indicate that localized structural damage behavior varies with impact energy, foam-core height and impact angle, while stacking sequences of facesheet have little effect on the impact resistance of the sandwich panel. The foam core dominates the energy absorption especially in the case with perforation damage. The reported results may be useful in safety design and maintenance. © 2023","Composite sandwich; Damage behavior; Failure analysis framework; Localized impact; Parametric study","Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Analysis frameworks; Composite sandwiches; Damage behaviour; Damage failures; Failure analyse framework; Foam core; Impact energy; Localised; Localized impact; Parametric study; Energy absorption","Ravichandran, Guruswaminaidu, Sandwich Structures, Experimental Mechanics, 52, 1, pp. 1-2, (2012); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Pan, Zhongxiang, Transverse impact damage and axial compression failure of square braided CFRP/PMI sandwich composite beams, Thin-Walled Structures, 162, (2021); Thomsen, Ole Thybo, Sandwich materials for wind turbine blades - Present and future, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 11, 1, pp. 7-26, (2009); Castanié, B., Review of composite sandwich structure in aeronautic applications, Composites Part C: Open Access, 1, (2020); John, Marianne, Dimensional changes in CFRP/PMI foam core sandwich structures, Applied Composite Materials, 20, 4, pp. 601-614, (2013); Mei, Jie, Fabrication and mechanical characterization of CFRP X-core sandwich panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 158, (2021); Zhou, Hao, Quasi-static compressive strength of polymethacrylimide foam-filled square carbon fiber reinforced composite honeycombs, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 6, pp. 2358-2374, (2021); Deng, Jian, On stability and damage behavior of asymmetric sandwich panels under uniaxial compression, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 6, pp. 1870-1901, (2021); Dogan, Akar, Low-velocity impact, bending, and compression response of carbon fiber/epoxy-based sandwich composites with different types of core materials, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 6, pp. 1956-1971, (2021)",""

Numerous natural materials prove that hollow structures present unique combinations of mechanical properties and functionalities with minimal weight cost. Therefore, a novel 3D hollow re-entrant auxetic (HRA) lattice metamaterial is proposed to improve the energy absorption capacity. To investigate the mechanical properties of the HRA lattices, an analytical model based on plastica theory is established to predict the crushing force. The energy absorption behaviors of the HRA lattices under quasi-static crushing load are studied based on finite element method, and the analytical predictions are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results. The analytical model can be used to optimize the appropriate design parameters of the HRA lattice and explain the simulation results in the parametric studies. Compared with the solid re-entrant auxetic (SRA) lattice with the same density, specific energy absorption of the HRA lattice can be improved by up to 27.43%. Finally, a parametric investigation is carried out to comprehend the influences of the length-to-height ratio, the re-entrant angle, the width-to-height ratio, and the wall thickness-to-height ratio on the energy absorption capacity of the HRA lattices. According to various energy absorption demands, the HRA lattices with different energy absorption properties can be designed by tuning these design parameters.

A tetrachiral honeycomb (TCH) exhibits a bulging effect when subjected to in-plane impact, reducing its Poisson's ratio effect. To improve the performance of TCH, this study proposes two types of axisymmetric tetrachiral honeycombs (ATCH-1 and ATCH-2). First, the in-plane impact performances of TCH, ATCH-1, and ATCH-2 are compared via experiments, and the accuracy of the finite element model is validated. Then, the effects of the different parameters on the deformation modes, energy absorption characteristics, and negative Poisson's ratio effects of the three types of honeycombs are analyzed via finite element models. ATCH-1 and ATCH-2 have higher specific energy absorption (SEA) and a more significant negative Poisson's ratio effect than TCH at an impact velocity of 10 m/s. However, the axisymmetric honeycombs do not have advantages at impact velocities of 50 m/s and 100 m/s. The cylindrical radius r significantly affects the deformation mode of the three types of honeycombs.

The study aims to analyze the effects of different factors on the flexural performance of the sandwich beams, including the variation in bio content within the polymeric matrices, different facing thicknesses, and the orientation of the R-PET honeycomb core. Three different polymeric matrices, namely a synthetic resin, a partial bio-resin, and a bio-resin are considered. A total of 30 sandwich beam specimens (300 mm long and 25 mm wide) were prepared with three different facing thicknesses (1, 2, and 3 mm) and two orientations of the R-PET honeycomb core (strong vs. weak axes) using the three polymeric matrices. The beam specimens were tested under four-point bending until failure. The facing and core materials were also tested in tension and shear, respectively, in two orthogonal directions. Significant non-linearity is observed in the behaviour of the beam specimens, which is rooted in the non-linearity of both facing and core materials. Additionally, the results demonstrate that alterations in polymer composition significantly impact the tensile properties of FRPs, which then affect the bending performance of the sandwich beams. To further corroborate experimental findings, a finite element simulation is also employed for analyzing the sandwich beams. The outcomes offer valuable insight for the designers planning to develop efficient and sustainable composite materials, thereby advancing the creation of environmentally friendly structural components. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","Bio-resin; Honeycomb; PET; Recycled plastic; Sustainability","Coremaking; Ductile fracture; Facings; Fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Plastic bottles; Plastic recycling; Sandwich structures; Bio-resin; Composite facings; Flexural performance; Honeycomb; Honeycomb core; Polyethylene terephthalate fibers; Polymeric matrices; Recycled plastics; Recycled polyethylene terephthalates; Sandwich beams; Polyethylene terephthalates","Valluzzi, Maria Rosa, Current practice and open issues in strengthening historical buildings with composites, Materials and Structures/Materiaux et Constructions, 47, 12, pp. 1971-1985, (2014); Mara, Valbona, Bridge decks of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP): A sustainable solution, Construction and Building Materials, 50, pp. 190-199, (2014); Li, Ming, Rehabilitation of seismic-damaged reinforced concrete beam-column joints with different corrosion rates using basalt fiber-reinforced polymer sheets, Composite Structures, 289, (2022); Bakis, Charles E., Fiber-reinforced polymer composites for construction - State-of-the-art review, Journal of Composites for Construction, 6, 2, pp. 73-87, (2002); undefined; Balikoglu, Fatih, An experimental study on the flexural behaviour of symmetric and asymmetric marine composite sandwich beams, Journal of Composite Materials, 56, 15, pp. 2311-2325, (2022); Mohamed, Mohaned M., Manufacturing and evaluation of polyurethane composite structural insulated panels, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 18, 6, pp. 769-789, (2016); Jacques, Eric, Behavior of Structural Insulated Panels Subjected to Short-Term Axial Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 145, 11, (2019); Amran, Mugahed Yahya Hussein, Design innovation, efficiency and applications of structural insulated panels: A review, Structures, 27, pp. 1358-1379, (2020); Fam, Amir Z., Fiber element model of sandwich panels with soft cores and composite skins in bending considering large shear deformations and localized skin wrinkling, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 142, 5, (2016)",""

However, the practical application of currently available conventional scaling methodologies for impact and explosive processes are significantly restricted by their inability to properly capture the scale effects of strain rate and strain hardening. Also, they are suffering from an insufficient number of independent degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the zeroth-order finite similitude theory, which can annihilate the non-scalability of rate and hardening effects, doesn’t provide us with efficient scaling methods when the investigated structure is made out of different materials. More precisely, the zeroth-order finite similitude theory and the classical dimensional analysis, which are suffering from a limited number of independent degrees of freedom, cannot scale the elastic-plastic behaviour represented by different parts of a structure made out of different materials. In other words, classical scaling methodologies including dimensional analysis and even the zeroth-order finite similitude theory cannot fix two different features having the same unit using different degrees of freedom, which make them useless for structures made of more than one material such as bi-material sandwich panels. In the presented paper, a new scaling methodology is developed based on the recently proposed first-order finite similitude theory which for the first time enables us to capture the rate dependent plastic behaviour of an impacted structure made out of two different materials. A sandwich panel made of two different materials which is subjected to an impact loading is considered as the case study in order to investigate the efficiency of the proposed first-order based scaling technique. The numerical results are determined using Abaqus finite element software in which the Johnson-Cook constitutive equation is utilized to take into account the rate and hardening effects on the initial yield stress. The results reveal that the behaviour of impacted full-scale bi-material sandwich panels can be predicted with a high accuracy when the extra degree of freedom provided us with the first-order finite similitude (i.e. R<inf>1</inf>) is set to vary between −1 and 1 (i.e. (Formula presented.) ). Furthermore, it is found that the pure mechanical and thermo-mechanical behaviour of the impacted core honeycomb are highly accurately predicted using scaled-down trial models which are made from dissimilar materials and designed based on the zeroth-order finite similitude theory. © IMechE 2023.","different loading rates; high order finite similitude; sandwich panels; Scaling; structural impact","ABAQUS; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dissimilar materials; Elastoplasticity; Sandwich structures; Strain rate; Yield stress; Bi-material; Different loading rate; High order finite similitude; High-order; Higher-order; Loading rate; Sandwich panel; Scaling methodology; Scalings; Structural impact; Strain hardening","Casaburo, Alessandro, A Review of Similitude Methods for Structural Engineering, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 71, 3, (2019); Oshiro, Roberto Eiki, Scaling impacted structures, Archive of Applied Mechanics, 74, 1-2, pp. 130-145, (2004); Booth, Edmund D., IMPACT SCALABILITY OF PLATED STEEL STRUCTURES., pp. 136-174, (1983); Jiang, P., Experimental investigation into scaling laws for conical shells struck by projectiles, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 8, pp. 1284-1298, (2006); Alves, M.

In this paper, a novel negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb (NPH) is proposed by introducing a reinforced strut into the negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb (NPR). A finite element numerical model was constructed using Abaqus/Explicit, and the accuracy of the model was verified, and a series of researches were carried out. First, the mechanical properties of NPH at different angles were analyzed under different loading conditions, and the results showed that under the loading conditions of y-direction and x-direction, NPH-120 and NPH-105 had the best mechanical properties respectively. Subsequently, the mechanical properties of NPH at different velocities were studied. The research showed that the NPR effect of NPH was the most obvious under low-velocity impact, and as the velocity increased, the inertia effect increased, and NPH's deformation mode has changed. And the dynamic Poisson's ratio of NPH at medium-velocity is analyzed, and its energy absorption mechanism is analyzed through the deformation of subunits. Finally, the mechanical properties of NPH under different wall thicknesses were studied, and the mechanical properties of several typical reinforced supports and NPH-120 were compared. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","In-plane impact; Mechanical properties; Negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb; Reinforced strut","ABAQUS; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Reinforcement; Struts; ABAQUS EXPLICIT; Finite element numerical models; Honeycomb effects; In-plane impact; Loading condition; Low velocity impact; Mechanical behavior; Negative Poisson ratio; Negative poisson ratio honeycomb; Reinforced strut; Energy absorption","undefined, (2021); Zheng, Tengteng, Research on seismic performance of honeycomb plate cylindrical reticulated shell structure, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 18, (2023); Xing, Youdong, Energy absorption and optimization of Bi-directional corrugated honeycomb aluminum, Composites Part B: Engineering, 219, (2021); Wang, Hao, Paper-based composites as a dual-functional material for ultralight broadband radar absorbing honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 202, (2020); Peng, Chenxi, Bioinspired functionally graded gyroid sandwich panel subjected to impulsive loadings, Composites Part B: Engineering, 188, (2020); Huang, Zhixin, Experimental and numerical studies on the bending collapse of multi-cell Aluminum/CFRP hybrid tubes, Composites Part B: Engineering, 181, (2020); Chen, Yu, Curved inserts in auxetic honeycomb for property enhancement and design flexibility, Composite Structures, 280, (2022); Xu, Na, Novel 2D star-shaped honeycombs with enhanced effective Young's modulus and negative Poisson's ratio, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 43, (2021); Wang, Liang, 3D compression–torsion cubic mechanical metamaterial with double inclined rods, Extreme Mechanics Letters, 37, (2020); Dudek, Krzysztof K., Unimode metamaterials exhibiting negative linear compressibility and negative thermal expansion, Smart Materials and Structures, 25, 2, (2016)",""

The simulation results clearly reproduced the formation, development, and stabilization processes of the debris cloud as well as the damage and response processes of the honeycomb sandwich shield. The petal-shaped multicellular internal structure of the debris cloud was proposed by combining the formation and development of the debris cloud with its experimentally observed morphology. The damage and response processes of the honeycomb sandwich shield can be divided into two stages, namely, the crushing and inertial motion stages, to elaborate the varying failure modes of the honeycomb sandwich shield in different stages. The crushing stage represents the response of the material, whose failure modes include penetration, bending, buckling, tensile fracture, and compression failure. The inertial motion stage represents the structural response (bending and buckling of foils), which, at different positions, leads to folding and compaction of the honeycomb core layer by layer along the radial direction. The factors influencing the channeling effect were investigated, and the influences of the projectile diameter and impact position on the channeling effect and protection performance of the honeycomb sandwich shield were analyzed. The envelope analysis method for damage areas, which can predict the damage to the honeycomb core and rear plate at any impact position using an envelope diagram, was proposed. It was shown that the foil at different positions works by blocking or partitioning, which seriously affects the channeling effect.

The high velocity impact tests were carried out using a compressed air gun. A sharp conical nosed projectile was impacted normally and with some offset distance (20 mm and 40 mm). The deformation, failure mode and energy dissipation characteristics were obtained for both kinds of loading. Moreover, the explicit solver was run in Abaqus to create the finite element model. The numerically obtained test results were compared with the experimental to check the accuracy of the modelling. The numerical result was further employed to obtain strain energy dissipation in each element by externally running user-defined code in Abaqus. Furthermore, the influence of inscribe circle diameter and cell wall and face sheet thickness on the energy dissipation, deformation and failure mode was examined. The result found that ballistic resistance and deformation were higher against offset impact compared to the normal impact loading. Sandwich panel impacted at 40 mm offset distance required 3 m/s and 1.9 m/s more velocity than 0 and 20 mm offset distance. Also, increasing the face sheet and wall thickness had a positive impact on the ballistic resistance in terms of a higher ballistic limit and energy absorption. However, inscribe circle diameter had a negative influence on the ballistic resistance. Also, the geometrical parameters of the sandwich structure had a significant influence on the energy dissipation in the different deformation directions. The energy dissipation in plastic work was highest for circumferential direction, regardless of impact condition followed by tangential, radial and axial directions. © 2023 China Ordnance Society","Deformation and failure mode; Energy dissipation characteristic; Geometry effect; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Offset impact","ABAQUS; Compressed air; Ductile fracture; Failure modes; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Strain energy; Ballistic resistance; Deformation and failure mode; Deformation and failures; Energy dissipation characteristics; Geometry effects; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Normal impact; Offset distances; Offset impact; Sandwich panel; Energy dissipation","Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids, MRS Bulletin, 28, 4, pp. 270-274, (2003); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Kolopp, Amélie, Experimental study of sandwich structures as armour against medium-velocity impacts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 61, pp. 24-35, (2013); Arslan, Kemal, Experimental tests and numerical modeling of ballistic impact on honeycomb sandwich structures reinforced by functionally graded plates, Journal of Composite Materials, 51, 29, pp. 4009-4028, (2017); Liaghat, Gholamhossein, Ballistic limit evaluation for impact of cylindrical projectiles on honeycomb panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 48, 1, pp. 55-61, (2010); Feli, Saeed, An analytical model for composite sandwich panels with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 43, 5, pp. 2439-2447, (2012); undefined; Rahimijonoush, Amirmasoud, Experimental and numerical studies on the ballistic impact response of titanium sandwich panels with different facesheets thickness ratios, Thin-Walled Structures, 157, (2020); Tiwari, G., Ballistic performance and energy dissipation characteristics of cylindrical honeycomb sandwich structure, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 160, (2022); Khaire, Nikhil, Perforation and energy dissipation behaviour of honeycomb core cylindrical sandwich shell subjected to conical shape projectile at high velocity impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 171, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

In this paper, two circular honeycombs with different arrangements were designed and fabricated using a 3D printer. Both honeycombs were investigated by experiment and finite element (FE) analysis to compare their performance. It is worth noting that both honeycombs possess the same relative density. The accuracy of the FE models was validated by comparing them with experimental results and relevant reports. Subsequently, a series of numerical studies were conducted to analyse the in-plane dynamic crushing behaviour and energy absorption characteristics at different impact velocities. Based on different experiment deformation modes were identified from the observation of results respectively. Additionally, continuous circle honeycomb (CCH) exhibits a higher reaction force but is prone to fracture. On the other hand, spacing circle honeycomb (SCH) possesses a lower reaction force but offers greater stability due to its ability to flex and release force. As a result, SCH can effectively absorb energy and demonstrates superior crushing capacity compared to CCH. To investigate and compare the plateau stress and energy absorption of these honeycombs, the FE method was used, which also involved a detailed analysis of the impact velocity and relative density of the honeycomb. It was observed that the crushing stress and energy absorption of SCH were higher than those of CCH with the same impact velocity and relative density. According to the one dimensional shock wave theory, empirical formulas for two circular honeycombs to predict the plateau stress are given respectively with the maximum error lower than 12%. This paper aims to offer valuable insights for the design of different configurations, with the goal of improving the crashworthiness and energy absorption capacity of a specific honeycomb structure. © 2023 The Author(s).

Consequently, it would lead to a dramatic decrease in structural load-bearing capacity and a threat to overall safety. Both experimental and numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the impact damage behavior of honeycomb sandwich composite specimens. The damage mode, damage parameters, and contact force-time curves of three types of panel materials with T300, T700, and T800 are obtained under different impact energies of 10 J, 20 J, and 40 J by the drop-weight impact experiment. Moreover, digital image correlation (DIC) tests are used to measure the deformation and strain of the lower panel. The experimental results reveal that the degree of damage increases with increasing impact energy. Particularly, the T300 panel specimen exhibits visible fiber fracture when subjected to an impact energy of 40 J. The impact process involves matrix cracking, fiber fracture, and delamination of the upper panel occurring first, followed by immediate crush damage to the honeycomb core and, finally, slight fiber damage to the lower panel. Due to its higher strength, the T800 panel specimen exhibits the highest damage resistance compared to the T700 and T300 panel specimens. To consider the microscopic failure criteria and various types of contact during the impact process, a finite element model of honeycomb sandwich composites is established, and numerical simulation analysis of low-energy impact is performed to determine the damage mode, damage size, and contact-force curves. Comparative analysis demonstrates good agreement between the simulation and experimental results.

A novel elastomeric pre-buckled honeycomb structure is adopted and optimised, the performance of which is baselined relative to vinyl nitrile foam under direct and oblique loading conditions. Results demonstrate that a simplified optimisation strategy is scalable to represent the behaviour of a full helmet. Under oblique impact conditions, the optimised pre-buckled honeycomb liner exceeds the contemporary material performance when considering computed kinematic metrics head and rotational injury criterion, by up to 49.9% and 56.6%.

Metastructures with the ability to manipulate wave propagation are particularly desirable in numerous applications, such as actuators, dampers, and lightweight impact resistant systems with structural tunability and recoverability. Specifically, multi-stable structural forms have attracted considerable attention in the design of architected multi-materials, metamaterials, and morphing structures. To design such systems, a recently developed mechanical metamaterial/metastructure known as negative stiffness honeycomb, composed of arrays of curved double-beams (CDBs), is proposed. Here, we develop an analytical model to predict the dynamic response of the CDB metastructures, architected with a periodic array of the CDBs, and subjected to impact by a striker. The analytical model is developed using the Euler-Lagrange theorem and the snap-buckling phenomena in the honeycomb have been examined. The derived closed-form solutions were in good agreement with those of the numerical finite element model at different bistability ratios, defined as the ratio of beam apex height to its thickness. The findings demonstrated that the bistability ratio had a noticeable influence on the buckling response of the metastructure and the desired negativity in the stiffness matrix, while the snap-back buckling phenomena may be realised at high bistability ratios. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bistability ratio; Mechanical metamaterials; Negative stiffness honeycomb metastructure (NSHM); Poincaré-Lindstedt method; Snap-through buckling","Buckling; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Stiffness; Stiffness matrix; Wave propagation; Bi-stability; Bistability ratio; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Metastructures; Negative stiffness; Negative stiffness honeycomb metastructure; Poincare; Poincare-lindstedt method; Snap-through buckling; Analytical models","Micromechanical Material Models for Polymer Composites Through Advanced Numerical Simulation Techniques, (2009); Alderson, Andrew, Auxetic materials, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 221, 4, pp. 565-575, (2007); Alonso-Mora, Javier, Collision avoidance for aerial vehicles in multi-agent scenarios, Autonomous Robots, 39, 1, pp. 101-121, (2015); Baughman, Ray H., Avoiding the shrink, Nature, 425, 6959, (2003); Stability of Structures Elastic Inelastic Fracture and Damage Theories, (1991); Bouaoune, L., Random versus periodic microstructures for elasticity of fibers reinforced composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 103, pp. 68-73, (2016); Brunet, Thomas, Soft 3D acoustic metamaterial with negative index, Nature Materials, 14, 4, pp. 384-388, (2015); Camescasse, B., Bistable buckled beam: Elastica modeling and analysis of static actuation, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 50, 19, pp. 2881-2893, (2013); Cazottes, Paul, Bistable buckled beam: Modeling of actuating force and experimental validations, Journal of Mechanical Design, 131, 10, pp. 1010011-10100110, (2009); Chen, Shuai, A novel composite negative stiffness structure for recoverable trapping energy, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 129, (2020)","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The paper investigates the nonlinear repeated low-velocity impact responses of auxetic honeycomb composite plates, taking into account loading-unloading-reloading processes. Effective material properties of the auxetic honeycomb core and GPR face sheets are obtained by using the proposed modified Gibson function and Halpin–Tsai model. Then, taking into account geometric nonlinearity, the nonlinear equations of motion for the system were derived by Hamilton’s principle. Afterward, the time-varying contact force between the composite plate and a spherical impactor is defined by the modified nonlinear Hertz contact theory. The Galerkin method and variable-step Runge–Kutta algorithm are selected to obtain nonlinear impact responses. The proposed methods are verified by finite element simulation and experiment.

First, random honeycombs were established with various meso-structural parameters based on the Voronoi technique and then manufactured by 3D printing. Quasi-static compression tests were performed using a universal test machine. The results indicated that the random honeycombs exhibited a more uniform deformation mode which led to a gentle stress–strain curve when compared with the regular honeycombs. Furthermore, the strain rate effect of the base material was determined by Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) tests. Finite element models considering the base material strain rate were verified by the quasi-static compression and drop weight impact tests. Dynamic simulations were carried out to determine the critical velocity between the deformation mode and clarify its mechanisms. The second critical velocities increase as the cell size and cell wall thickness increased or as the strain rate effect of the base material is considered. The effects of inertia and base material strain rate on the mechanical properties were discussed. The dynamic stress enhancement is dominated by the strain rate effect of the base material and the inertia effect in the random and shock modes, respectively.

Hence, the inclusion of appropriate energy-absorbing structures is highly recommended during the design phase. The energy absorption capability of an aluminium 5056 (Al 5056) alloy honeycomb core, subjected to a vehicle impact, is investigated in this study. The impact effectiveness is investigated using ANSYS LS-DYNA finite element analysis. To explore the behaviour of a honeycomb core, it was first constructed, modelled, and crashed. The effect of different cell parameters on energy absorption is then studied by crashing the honeycombs with varying cell parameters. The energy absorption is estimated using the single honeycomb cell model, which is in accordance with the numerical calculations for different cell parameters of both single honeycomb cell and whole honeycomb core. Parametric studies are carried out for varied cell sizes, cell heights, cell thicknesses, impact velocity, and core material density to explore distinct cell factors that influence energy absorption capability. Among the numerous cell parameters evaluated, the cell wall thickness and core material density impact specific energy absorption. A single honeycomb cell and a honeycomb core were modelled using the optimum cell configurations and later subjected to a crash test.

In this paper, the damage mechanism and protective effect of near-field blast load on sandwich structure based on foam-nickel core material were studied. Firstly, the near-field explosion test was conducted to investigate the blast response of the foam-nickel sandwich structure subjected to blast shock from 8701 explosive at near-field position. The deformation characteristics and stress history of the sandwich structure on the acting location of blast load were carefully investigated via experimental methods. A finite element model of near-field explosion was established for effective numerical modelling of the dynamic behaviour of the sandwich structure using the explicit dynamics software ANSYS/LS-DYNA for more comprehensive investigations of the blast shock response of the sandwich structure. The finite element model is reasonable and validated by mesh independence verification and comparing the simulated response behaviour to that from the experimental results for the sandwich structure subjected to near-field blast load. On this basis, the damage mechanism and protection effect of the near-field explosion impact on foam-nickel cores with different density and porosity are simulated more systematically. The investigated results from the experiments and a series of numerical simulations show the large deformation effect due to the extensive energy absorption, which suggests that the sandwich structure based on foam-nickel core material may be expected to become a new choice of protective structure under near-field blast load. © 2023 by the authors.","blast load; experimental testing; explosive; foam-nickel; numerical simulation; protective; sandwich panels","Coremaking; Dynamic loads; Dynamic response; Explosions; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Nickel; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Shock waves; Blast loads; Core material; Damage mechanism; Experimental testing; Finite element modelling (FEM); Foam nickel; Near fields; Protective; Sandwich panel; Structure-based; Explosives","Cai, Lingang, Study on Damage Characteristic of Foam Sandwich Panel Under Combined Action of Explosion Shock Wave and Fragments, Wuhan Ligong Daxue Xuebao (Jiaotong Kexue Yu Gongcheng Ban)/Journal of Wuhan University of Technology (Transportation Science and Engineering), 44, 2, pp. 316-320, (2020); Chen, De, Optimal design of sandwich panels with layered-gradient aluminum foam cores under air-blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 166, pp. 169-186, (2019); Cheng, Yuansheng, The effects of foam filling on the dynamic response of metallic corrugated core sandwich panel under air blast loading – Experimental investigations, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 145, pp. 378-388, (2018); Dai, Wei, Dynamic response of V-shaped sandwich panel under blast loading, Gaoya Wuli Xuebao/Chinese Journal of High Pressure Physics, 30, 6, pp. 484-490, (2016); Jing, Lin, Experimental and numerical study of square sandwich panels with layered-gradient foam cores to air-blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 161, (2021); Patel, Murlidhar, Novel design of honeycomb hybrid sandwich structures under air-blast, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 8, pp. 2105-2123, (2022); Zhang, Pengfei, Dynamic response of sandwich tubes with graded foam aluminum cores under internal blast loading, Baozha Yu Chongji/Explosion and Shock Waves, 40, 7, (2020); Sawant, Rashmi, Numerical analysis of honeycomb sandwich panels under blast load, Materials Today: Proceedings, 87, pp. 67-73, (2023); Sun, Guangyong, Dynamic Response Analysis of Hierarchical Aluminum Honeycomb Sandwich Structure Subjected to Explosive Load, Huanan Ligong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science), 45, 5, pp. 141-146, (2017); J Taiyuan Univ Technol, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

This paper presents a systematic numerical study on the compressive and flexural behaviour of re-entrant honeycomb and 3D re-entrant lattice using the finite element method implemented with ABAQUS/Explicit, in comparison with that of regular hexagonal honeycomb. The finite element model was validated with experimental data obtained from the literature, followed by a mesh size sensitivity analysis performed to determine the optimal element size. A series of simulations was then conducted to investigate the failure mechanisms and effects of different factors including strain rate, relative density, unit cell number, and material property on the dynamic response of re-entrant auxetics subjected to axial and flexural loading. The simulation results indicate that 3D re-entrant lattice is superior to hexagonal honeycomb and re-entrant honeycomb in energy dissipation, which is insensitive to unit cell number. Replacing re-entrant honeycomb with 3D re-entrant lattice leads to an 884% increase in plastic energy dissipation and a 694% rise in initial peak stress. Under flexural loading, the re-entrant honeycomb shows a small flexural modulus, but maintains the elastic deformation regime over a large range of strain. In all cases, the compressive and flexural dynamic response of re-entrant auxetics exhibits a strong dependence on strain rate, relative density, and material property. This study provides intuitive insight into the compressive and flexural performance of re-entrant auxetics, which can facilitate the optimal design of auxetic composites. © 2023 by the authors.","auxetic structures; dynamic properties; finite element modelling; metamaterials; negative Poisson’s ratio","ABAQUS; Ductile fracture; Dynamic response; Dynamics; Energy dissipation; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Compressive behavior; Dynamics properties; Element models; Finite element modeling; Flexural behavior; Hexagonal honeycomb; Negative poisson’s ratio; S ratio; Strain rate","Gibson, Lorna J., MECHANICS OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL CELLULAR MATERIALS., 382, 1782, pp. 25-42, (1982); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Ren, Xin, Auxetic metamaterials and structures: A review, Smart Materials and Structures, 27, 2, (2018); Liu, Wangyu, The effect of irregularity, residual convex units and stresses on the effective mechanical properties of 2D auxetic cellular structure, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 609, pp. 26-33, (2014); Zhang, Xinchun, The influence of cell micro-structure on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs with negative Poisson’s ratio, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 17, 1, pp. 26-55, (2015); Liu, Wangyu, In-plane dynamic crushing of re-entrant auxetic cellular structure, Materials and Design, 100, pp. 84-91, (2016); Dhari, Rahul Singh, On the inclined static loading of honeycomb re-entrant auxetics, Composite Structures, 273, (2021); Dhari, Rahul Singh, On the deformation mechanism of re-entrant honeycomb auxetics under inclined static loads, Materials Letters, 286, (2021); Mustahsan, Farrukh, Re-Entrant Honeycomb Auxetic Structure with Enhanced Directional Properties, Materials, 15, 22, (2022); Zied, Khaled M., Enhancement of the in-plane stiffness of the hexagonal re-entrant auxetic honeycomb cores, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 252, 12, pp. 2685-2692, (2015)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Heterogeneous structures have been created using polyetheretherketone (PEEK) material, glass fiber-reinforced PEEK (GF-PEEK), and carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK (CF-PEEK) to further enhance the load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and impact resistance of HSS. In this study, we investigated the low-velocity impact response of HSS using numerical simulation. Our findings demonstrate that the choice of construction material significantly affects the impact resistance and structural stability of the HSS. We found that using fiber-reinforced PEEK significantly enhances the impact resistance of the overall structure, with GF-PEEK identified as the more appropriate face sheet material for the composite HSS based on a comparative study of load–displacement curves. Analysis of the plastic deformation of the honeycomb core, in combination with the stress and strain distribution of the composite HSS after low-velocity impact, indicates that CF-PEEK face sheets cause more noticeable damage to the core, resulting in evident plastic deformation. Additionally, we discovered that the use of fiber-reinforced materials effectively reduces deflection during low-velocity dynamic impact, particularly when both the face sheet and honeycomb core of the HSS are composed of the same fiber-reinforced PEEK material. These results provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of composite HSS for impact resistance applications. © 2023 by the authors.","fiber-reinforced; finite element analysis; heterogeneous sandwich structure; low-velocity impact","Fiber reinforced materials; Fibers; Honeycomb structures; Plastic deformation; Sandwich structures; Stress-strain curves; Carbon fiber reinforced; Face sheets; Fibre-reinforced; Finite element analyse; Glass fibre reinforced; Heterogeneous sandwich structure; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Finite element method","Rong, Yu, Effects of geometric configurations of corrugated cores on the local impact and planar compression of sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 152, pp. 324-335, (2018); Farshidi, Arash, Numerical fracture analysis and model validation for disbonded honeycomb core sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 210, pp. 231-238, (2019); Wang, Zhonggang, Recent advances in novel metallic honeycomb structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 166, pp. 731-741, (2019); Zhang, Dahai, Crushing of vertex-based hierarchical honeycombs with triangular substructures, Thin-Walled Structures, 146, (2020); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical studies on indentation and perforation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 110-124, (2018); Foo, Choon Chiang, Low-velocity impact failure of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 85, 1, pp. 20-28, (2008); Xue, Xinwei, Study on the impact resistance of honeycomb sandwich structures under low-velocity/heavy mass, Composite Structures, 226, (2019); Sun, Guangyong, High-velocity impact behaviour of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels with different structural configurations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 122, pp. 119-136, (2018); Liu, Longquan, The flatwise compressive properties of Nomex honeycomb core with debonding imperfections in the double cell wall, Composites Part B: Engineering, 76, pp. 122-132, (2015); Tao, Yong, Mechanical properties and energy absorption of 3D printed square hierarchical honeycombs under in-plane axial compression, Composites Part B: Engineering, 176, (2019)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The edge-based design has been regarded as an effective strategy to enhance the mechanical properties and energy absorption of honeycomb materials. This paper proposes a novel super hexagonal honeycomb (SHH) structure to pursue better energy absorption capacities. Its geometry is derived from the outline of a hexagonal honeycomb. The crushing performance of the SHH is investigated based on the out-of-plane compression experiments, and an explicit finite element model is established to explore the crashworthiness characteristics of the structure. Furthermore, a theoretical model based on the simplified super folding element (SSFE) method is established to predict the mean crushing force during the crushing process. The comparison with the experimental and numerical results verifies its accuracy. Besides, the crushing mechanisms and collapse modes of the constitutive Y and V elements in the SHH are discussed. The parametric analysis of the crashworthiness of the SHH is conducted in terms of the cell-wall length ratio, sub-corner angle and hierarchy. The results reveal that the crashworthiness of SHH is much superior to traditional hexagonal honeycomb and presents 106%, 62%, 104% and 162% improvement in the mean crushing force, crushing force efficiency, specific energy absorption and volumetric energy absorption, respectively.

The finite element model of the structure is developed using the Johnson-Cook material model and is used to study the effects of projectile impacts for velocities between 150 and 450 m/s. The FE model is validated using in-house experiments on 3D printed PLA sandwich with tetrachiral core under hemispherical projectile impact and also using experimental data reported in the literature. Further, a semi-analytical model is developed to estimate the residual velocities and energy absorption of sandwich structure under blunt projectile impact, which shows good agreement with the FE results with an error of less than 8%. Finally, the performance of the sandwich structure with tetrachiral cores is studied under projectile impact for velocities ranging from 150 to 350 m/s and compared with sandwich structures with re-entrant and double arrowhead cores. The results show that for velocities above the ballistic limit, the energy absorbed by the facesheets, and core are nearly constant and is greatest for blunt projectile impact, followed by hemispherical, ogive, and conical geometries. Furthermore, sandwich structures with auxetic cores exhibit better energy absorption characteristics compared to those with hexagonal honeycomb cores. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic materials; High velocity impact; Sandwich structure; Tetrachiral core","3D printing; Analytical models; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Projectiles; Absorption characteristics; Auxetic materials; Auxetics; Blunt projectiles; Deformation Characteristics; Finite elements simulation; High-velocity impact; Impact response; Projectile impact; Tetrachiral core; Sandwich structures","Gonçalves, Paulo Teixeira, Parametric analysis of energy absorption capacity of thin aluminum plates impacted by rigid spherical projectiles, Thin-Walled Structures, 159, (2021); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical studies on indentation and perforation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 110-124, (2018); Alonso, Luis, Analytical models for the perforation of thick and thin thickness woven-laminates subjected to high-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 143, pp. 292-300, (2018); Nikkhah, Hamid, Evaluation of crushing and energy absorption characteristics of bio-inspired nested structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Feng, Yixiong, Creative design for sandwich structures: A review, International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 17, 3, (2020); Kumar Saxena, Krishna Kumar, Three Decades of Auxetics Research − Materials with Negative Poisson's Ratio: A Review, Advanced Engineering Materials, 18, 11, pp. 1847-1870, (2016); Ren, Xin, Auxetic metamaterials and structures: A review, Smart Materials and Structures, 27, 2, (2018); Kelkar, Parth Uday, Cellular auxetic structures for mechanical metamaterials: A review, Sensors, 20, 11, (2020); Alomarah, Amer, Compressive properties of 3D printed auxetic structures: experimental and numerical studies, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 15, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020)",""

This hazard of an explosive attack affects the lives of people and property. As a result, the modern era is searching for blast resistance structures to save humans and properties from these serious attacks. However, the current numerical analysis represents an effort in the novel design of blast-proof sandwich structures to meet the current era's demand. A stainless-steel sandwich structure using a square honeycomb core was designed to perform conventional weapons effects program (CONWEP) air-blast analysis on ABAQUS/Explicit. After a mesh sensitivity study and validation of the steel sandwich structure with experimental data published in the literature, the effect on blast characteristics of the aluminum (Al) foam-filled honeycomb and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) with steel skins using fiber metal laminate (FML) for the front, back, or both skins of the sandwich structure was investigated. The entire finite element (FE) modeled sandwich structures were subjected to 1 to 10 kg of TNT air-blast loads at stand-off distances (SoD) ranging from 150 mm to 200 mm, and their blast resistance performance was evaluated using skin deflection and energy absorption. The damage initiation and evolution of composite laminates in the FML skins were investigated by the Hashin, Puck, and Singh failure criteria, respectively. These criteria were implemented via the VUMAT code. The obtained results showed that using FML skin for the sandwich structure diminished both the front and back skin deflection while improving specific energy absorption. A positive impact on blast mitigation by sandwich structures was observed with an increase in SoD. The lightweight FML front skin and steel back skin used bare square honeycomb hybrid sandwich structure had the smallest back skin deflection and the highest energy absorption up to 3 kg TNT. For the same combination of skins, the hybrid sandwich with foam-filled square honeycomb core represented a positive impact on the blast proof characteristics for high-intensity blasts ranging from 5 kg to 10 kg TNT. However, the novel designed hybrid sandwiches are recommended as a protective structure for defense, ships, automotive, etc. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Blast resistance; CFRP; Energy; FML; Foam; Sandwich structure; TNT","ABAQUS; Blast resistance; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Energy absorption; Explosives; Filled polymers; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Laminated composites; Network security; Steel fibers; Terrorism; 'current; Blast analysis; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Energy; Fibre Metal Laminates; Honeycomb core; Laminate skin; Property; Square honeycombs; TNT; Sandwich structures","Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of sandwich plates with GLARE face-sheets and honeycomb core under metal foam projectile impact: Experimental and numerical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 164, (2022); Yan, Junbo, Ballistic characteristics of 3D-printed auxetic honeycomb sandwich panel using CFRP face sheet, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 164, (2022); Cai, Sipei, Dynamic response of sandwich panels with multi-layered aluminum foam/UHMWPE laminate cores under air blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 138, (2020); Quang, Vu Dinh, Static buckling analysis and geometrical optimization of magneto-electro-elastic sandwich plate with auxetic honeycomb core, Thin-Walled Structures, 173, (2022); Burns, Devin J., First failure load of sandwich beams under transient loading using a space–time coupled finite element method, Thin-Walled Structures, 173, (2022); Kumar, Vimal, Experimental and numerical investigation of reinforced concrete slabs under blast loading, Engineering Structures, 206, (2020); Deng, Yunfei, Experimental investigation into the response of GFRP S-shaped foldcore sandwich panels to impulsive loading, Journal of Building Engineering, 52, (2022); Tuzgel, Firat, Testing and modeling blast loading of a sandwich structure cored with a bio-inspired (balanus) core, Thin-Walled Structures, 175, (2022); Ma, Xiaomin, Blast response of gradient honeycomb sandwich panels with basalt fiber metal laminates as skins, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 123, pp. 126-139, (2019); Wang, Tao, Blast response of geometrically asymmetric metal honeycomb sandwich plate: Experimental and theoretical investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 105, pp. 24-38, (2017)",""

A uniaxial quasi-static compression study is carried out on auxetics and hybrid auxetic structures loaded along the x and y directions. The deformation patterns of the structures are discussed to understand the failure modes.

The discontinuous process for producing these panels involves the injection of a reacting PU mixture in a closed cavity, where the liquid mixture flows, reacts, and expands to fill the cavity before curing. The injection process is a well-known source of defects and non-uniform foam properties, which could negatively influence the performance of these panels. A better, more uniform foam distribution in the panel cavity would help eliminate many of these defects, improving the quality of such products. Therefore, a Finite Element Method (FEM) model was developed to simulate the foam injection and expansion processes in a panel cavity, and to understand which parameters have the most significant impact on foam distribution. This FEM model was used to predict the optimal conditions for filling a standard IMP, to achieve a defect-free product.

The novel hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb can not only improve energy absorption capacity but also present better vibration insulation compared with traditional RH structure. Dynamic crushing behaviors of the SRH structures are investigated theoretically and numerically. The theoretical plateau stress is in good agreement with the numerical plateau stress. Meanwhile, the deformation modes and energy absorption capacity of RH and square re-entrant honeycombs (SRHs) are compared under different impact velocities. The results show that the plateau stress and the specific energy absorption (SEA) of SRHs is higher than RH. Moreover, the vibration isolation capability of the SRHs is studied using finite element analysis. In particular, the introduction of square unit cells expand the band gap, especially in the low frequency range. By adjusting the size of oscillators, the starting and stopping frequencies of band gaps are lower effectively and the number of band gaps is increased. The results indicate that the introduction of the mass inclusions can improve the band gap characteristics of the SRH, which produce local resonance effect and the local resonance type band gap.

However, understanding the compressive behavior of 3D auxetic structures at different strain rates and developing design methods are challenging tasks due to the limited literature and insufficient data. This paper presents a study on the behavior of Poisson’s ratio of an advanced 3D chiral structure, which is formed of two orthogonally positioned 2D hexagonal nodes-based chiral structures. Firstly, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are conducted to identify the Poisson’s ratio of 2D chiral structures. The same theoretical value of −1 is obtained for 2D chiral structures with a bending-dominated ligaments assumption. Thereafter, the Poisson’s ratio of 3D chiral structures is determined numerically using a low-speed loaded model composed of 5 × 5 × 8 3D unit cells for eliminating the boundary effects. The results show that impact velocity can strongly affect the energy absorption and deformation behavior of the proposed 3D chiral structure. Increasing the beam radius results in reduced energy absorption capability. However, the energy absorption capability of the 3D chiral structure is not sensitive to the yield strength of nodes. Impact direction affects the energy absorption performance of the 3D chiral structure, depending on the crushing strain. The research results could be used to optimize the design of the proposed novel 3D chiral honeycombs for various applications, such as impact energy absorbers and vibration-resistant dampers. © 2023 by the authors.","3D chiral auxetics; auxetic structures; finite element modelling; metamaterials; negative Poisson’s ratio","","Peroni, Marco, Impact behaviour testing of aluminium foam, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 53, pp. 74-83, (2013); Ashab, Asm S.M., Quasi-static and dynamic experiments of aluminum honeycombs under combined compression-shear loading, Materials and Design, 97, pp. 183-194, (2016); Nian, Weimin, Experimental investigation on blast response of cellular concrete, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 96, pp. 105-115, (2016); Yahaya, Mohd Azman, Response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to foam projectile impact - An experimental study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 100-109, (2015); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018); Zarei, Hamidreza, Optimum honeycomb filled crash absorber design, Materials and Design, 29, 1, pp. 193-204, (2008); D'Mello, Royan J., Inplane crush response and energy absorption of circular cell honeycomb filled with elastomer, Composite Structures, 106, pp. 491-501, (2013); Liu, Qiang, Axial and lateral crushing responses of aluminum honeycombs filled with EPP foam, Composites Part B: Engineering, 130, pp. 236-247, (2017); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic polymers: a new range of materials, Endeavour, 15, 4, pp. 170-174, (1991)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

To investigate the impact of layer stacking methods on the mechanical properties of multilayer honeycomb skeletons, 3D printing technology was used to prepare double-layer honeycomb skeleton tandem structures with different dislocation modes in compression testing. A finite element simulation model was established to conduct quasi-static simulation research. Compared to that of a single-layer honeycomb skeleton, the energy absorption of the honeycomb skeleton tandem structure increased. The optimal bearing capacity of the honeycomb skeleton was achieved when the upper and lower layers were precisely aligned. Once dislocation occurred, both the value of average platform stress and energy absorption decreased. Then, the bearing capacity of the honeycomb skeleton tandem structures increased with an enlargement of the dislocation, reaching its maximum at the half-dislocation period. An increase in the partition thickness and stiffness led to a reduction in the dislocation-induced effects on the mechanical properties. The research results can provide theoretical and data support for the engineering application of honeycomb skeleton tandem structures. © 2023 by the authors.","energy absorption; honeycomb skeleton; pressure-bearing performance; tandem structure","3D printing; Bearing capacity; Bearings (machine parts); Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Musculoskeletal system; Stiffness; Structural properties; 3-D printing; Bearing performance; Honeycomb skeleton; Layer stacking; Multi-layers; Pressure-bearing performance; Property; Stacking method; Tandem structure; Compression testing","Feng, Genzhu, Energy absorption performance of honeycombs with curved cell walls under quasi-static compression, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 210, (2021); Wei, Xingyu, New advances in fiber-reinforced composite honeycomb materials, Science China Technological Sciences, 63, 8, pp. 1348-1370, (2020); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Li, Meng, Crashworthiness design optimisation of metal honeycomb energy absorber used in lunar lander, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 16, 4, pp. 411-419, (2011); Ma, Quoc Phu, On aluminum honeycomb impact attenuator designs for formula student competitions, Symmetry, 12, 10, pp. 1-17, (2020); Zhang, Yafei, Application Characteristics of Zeolite-Based Stuffing for Nanofluidic Packer Rubber, Energies, 15, 21, (2022); China Pet Mach, (2021); Pet Mach, (2022); Weng, Hangjian, Energy absorption properties of tandem honeycomb with dislocated assembly, Zhejiang Daxue Xuebao (Gongxue Ban)/Journal of Zhejiang University (Engineering Science), 54, 12, pp. 2329-2335, (2020); Zhang, Xiaojing, Effect of dislocation and layer height on the compression performance of tandem honeycombs, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 2, pp. 928-949, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Impact tests on nine SCSP-IACs were performed via a hemispherical hammer. The failure modes of all specimens were determined as the local punching failure of the concrete core. Moreover, the impact force–time and displacement–time histories and the permanent deformation were discussed. The experiment results showed that increasing the steel faceplate thickness and concrete core height enhanced the impact performance of the SCSP-IACs. By contrast, increasing the IAC spacing weakened the impact performance. Moreover, the interlocking bolts slightly affected the impact responses of the SCSP-IACs. A finite element (FE) model was established and verified with test data. The model was used to analyze the internal forces and energy absorption of the SCSP-IACs under impact loads. The internal force diagrams of the panels at different impact stages were provided, and a significant hogging moment was observed from the bending moment distributions. The FE results also showed that the zones close to the center of the panel absorbed most of the impact energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Impact responses; Interlocked angle connectors; Numerical simulation; Steel–concrete–steel sandwich panels","Concretes; Sandwich structures; Concrete core; Experimental and numerical studies; Impact performance; Impact response; Interlocked angle connector; Internal forces; Sandwich composite panels; Steel sandwich panels; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich; Steel–concrete–steel sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Wang, Jin, Behaviour of steel-concrete-steel sandwich walls with EC connectors under out-of-plane patch loads, Engineering Structures, 238, (2021); Meng, Lingzhao, Experimental and numerical studies on steel-polyurethane foam-steel–concrete-steel panel under impact loading by a hemispherical head, Engineering Structures, 247, (2021); Zhou, Zhaohui, Tensile resistance of novel interlocked angle connectors used in steel-concrete-steel sandwich structures, Construction and Building Materials, 341, (2022); Richard Liew, J.

In this paper, we studied the impact resistance of two types of broadly used honeycomb structures (HCSs), a hexagonal HCS and an auxetic HCS. We developed a neural network (NN) which could effectively help to find an optimal gradient design for energy absorption of HCSs in contrast with their uniform counterpart. The optimal density gradient for both hexagonal HCS and auxetic HCS was identified, which are 66% and 40% higher in energy absorption than their respective uniform control. Followed finite-element analysis revealed that density gradient of HCSs enables loading transfer among a greater deformation zone, consequentially more cells involving in energy absorption. The initially graded sample promotes a de-gradient process and leads to more homogeneous density; conversely, a uniform sample develops localized deformation when subject to impact loading. Such an equal-load-partition (ELP) strategy in graded HCSs is responsible for their supreme energy absorption. The developed machine learning (ML) method for impact resistance optimization and the revealed deformation mechanisms in graded HCSs would be meaningful for the design of new advanced graded materials. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorption; Equal-load-partition; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Machine learning","Honeycomb structures; Machine learning; Auxetics; Density gradients; Equal-load-partition; Graded honeycomb; Gradient structure; Hexagonal honeycomb; High impact resistance; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Performance; Energy absorption","Liu, Z.

The effects of cell wall thickness, initial impact velocity and impact direction on the deformation modes and crush characteristic of the hexagonal honeycomb are investigated with an impact finite element model (FEM), in which the cell wall thickness and out-of-plane thickness of the hexagonal honeycomb are variable. The results showed that, when the hexagonal honeycomb was impacted in the transverse plane and longitudinal plane, the impact end of the structure always shrank inward until the middle of the hexagonal honeycomb was compacted, and finally the whole structure was compressed. When it was impacted in the 60° oblique plane, there was no inward shrinkage, and the whole structure was compressed and deformed from the impact end toward the fixed end. Under the same initial impact velocity in different impact directions, the initial peak force (IPF) and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the hexagonal honeycomb increased with the cell wall thickness. When the cell wall thickness was constant, the IPF and SEA of the hexagonal honeycomb increased with the initial impact velocity. Then empirical formulas for IPF and SEA of the hexagonal honeycomb crushing were obtained and verified by simulation. It was found that the errors of proposed empirical formulas for IPF and SEA of the hexagonal honeycomb both were within 10%, which means the empirical formulas can be used to predict the crashworthiness of the hexagonal honeycomb. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","crashworthiness characteristic; deformation mode; Hexagonal honeycomb; in-plane crush","Cells; Crushing; Cytology; Honeycomb structures; Cell-wall thickness; Crashworthiness characteristic; Deformation modes; Directional dynamics; Empirical formulas; Hexagonal honeycomb; Impact velocities; In-plane crush; Peak force; Specific energy absorption; Crashworthiness","Al Antali, A., The energy-absorbing properties of composite tube-reinforced aluminum honeycomb, Composite Structures, 176, pp. 630-639, (2017); Yao, Shuguang, The impact performance of honeycomb-filled structures under eccentric loading for subway vehicles, Thin-Walled Structures, 123, pp. 360-370, (2018); Jweeg, Muhsin J., Effects of core height, cell angle and face thickness on vibration behavior of aircraft sandwich structure with honeycomb core: An experimental and numerical investigations, Materials Science Forum, 1039 MSF, pp. 65-85, (2021); Sadiq, Sadiq Emad, Crashworthiness behavior of aircraft sandwich structure with honeycomb core under bending load., IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 881, 1, (2020); Crupi, Vincenzo, Theoretical and experimental analysis for the impact response of glass fibre reinforced aluminium honeycomb sandwiches, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 20, 1, pp. 42-69, (2018); Crupi, Vincenzo, Comparison of aluminium sandwiches for lightweight ship structures: Honeycomb vs. foam, Marine Structures, 30, pp. 74-96, (2013); Gao, Qiang, An analytical model of cylindrical double-arrowed honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 173, (2020); Gao, Qiang, Theoretical, numerical and experimental analysis of three-dimensional double-V honeycomb, Materials and Design, 139, pp. 380-391, (2018); Int J Comput Commun Eng, (2019); Qiao, Jinxiu, Impact resistance of uniform and functionally graded auxetic double arrowhead honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 83, pp. 47-58, (2015)",""

First, based on a recently developed composite projectile, impact tests of the sandwich panels against simulated combined loading were conducted to provide a benchmark for the computational model. Second, a computational model, based on three-dimensional finite element simulation, was constructed and verified by means of a comparison of the numerically calculated and experimentally measured peak deflections of the back facesheet and the residual velocity of the penetrated fragment. Third, the structural response and energy absorption characteristics were examined, based on numerical simulations. Finally, the optimal gradient of core configuration was explored and numerically examined. The results indicated that the sandwich panel responded in a combined manner involving global deflection, local perforation and perforation hole enlargement. As the impact velocity increased, both the peak deflection of the back facesheet and the residual velocity of the penetrated fragment increased. The front facesheet was found to be the most important sandwich component in consuming the kinetic energy of the combined loading. Thus, the compaction of the foam core would be facilitated by placing the low-density foam at the front side. This would further provide a larger deflecting space for the front facesheet, thus reducing the deflection of the back facesheet. The gradient of core configuration was found to have limited influence on the anti-perforation ability of the sandwich panel. Parametric study indicated that the optimal gradient of foam core configuration was not sensitive to time delay between blast loading and fragment impact loading, but was sensitive to the asymmetrical facesheet of the sandwich panel. © 2023 by the authors.","combined loading; graded foam; optimal gradient; sandwich panel","Computation theory; Computational methods; Deflection (structures); Honeycomb structures; Kinetics; Sandwich structures; Combined loading; Core configuration; Face sheets; Foam core; Fragment impacts; Graded foam; Impact loadings; Optimal gradient; Performance; Sandwich panel; Kinetic energy","Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Gu, Meixiang, Numerical Analysis of Passive Piles under Surcharge Load in Extensively Deep Soft Soil, Buildings, 12, 11, (2022); Ji, Long, Blast Resistance of 240 mm Building Wall Coated with Polyurea Elastomer, Materials, 15, 3, (2022); Ding, Chenxi, A study of crack propagation during blasting under high in-situ stress conditions based on an improved CDEM method, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 31, 20, pp. 4922-4939, (2024); Zhang, Wei, Experimental study of a composite beam externally bonded with a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic plate, Journal of Building Engineering, 71, (2023); Proc Conf Materials in Oceanic Environment Euromat 98, (1998); Wanchoo, Piyush, Advances in naval composite and sandwich structures for blast and implosion mitigations, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 26, 2, pp. 152-174, (2024); Zhang, Rui, Confinement effects on compressive and ballistic performance of ceramics: a review, International Materials Reviews, 66, 5, pp. 287-312, (2021); Main, Joseph A., Uniaxial crushing of sandwich plates under air blast: Influence of mass distribution, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 45, 7-8, pp. 2297-2321, (2008); Hassan, Mohamad Zaki, The influence of core density on the blast resistance of foam-based sandwich structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 50, pp. 9-16, (2012)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Based on the results of numerical simulations with the support of finite element analysis, the paper provides an evaluation of the accuracy of analytical dependencies for the determination of the moduli of elasticity of a carbon fibre honeycomb core in tension/compression and shear. It is shown that a carbon fibre honeycomb reinforcement pattern has a significant impact on the mechanical performance of the carbon fibre honeycomb core. For example, for honeycombs measuring 10 mm in height, the maximum shear modulus values corresponding to the reinforcement pattern of ±45° exceed the minimum values for a reinforcement pattern of 0° and 90° by more than 5 times in the XOZ plane and 4 times for the shear modulus in the YOZ plane. The maximum modulus of the elasticity of the honeycomb core in the transverse tension, corresponding to a reinforcement pattern of ±75°, exceeds the minimum modulus for the reinforcement pattern of ±15° more than 3 times. We observe a decrease in the values of the mechanical performance of the carbon fibre honeycomb core depending on its height. With a honeycomb reinforcement pattern of ±45°, the decrease in the shear modulus is 10% in the XOZ plane and 15% in the YOZ plane. The reduction in the modulus of elasticity in the transverse tension for the reinforcement pattern does not exceed 5%. It is shown that in order to ensure high-level moduli of elasticity with respect to tension/compression and shear at the same time, it is necessary to focus on a reinforcement pattern of ±64°. The paper covers the development of the experimental prototype technology that produces carbon fibre honeycomb cores and structures for aerospace applications. It is shown by experiments that the use of a larger number of thin layers of unidirectional carbon fibres provides more than a 2-time reduction in honeycomb density while maintaining high values of strength and stiffness. Our findings can permit a significant expansion of the area of application relative to this class of honeycomb cores in aerospace engineering. © 2023 by the authors.","experimental prototype technology; finite element analysis; modulus of elasticity; thermo-dimensional stability","Aerospace applications; Carbon fibers; Coremaking; Elastic moduli; Honeycomb structures; Reinforcement; Shear strain; A-carbon; A: Honeycomb; Experimental prototype; Experimental prototype technology; Finite element analyse; Honeycomb core; Mechanical performance; Reinforcement patterns; Tension-compression; Thermo-dimensional stability; Finite element method","Fomin, Oleksij V., Scientific substantiation of thermal leveling for deformations in the car structure, International Journal of Engineering and Technology (UAE), 7, 4.3 Special Issue 3, pp. 125-129, (2018); Panchenko, Sergii V., INFLUENCE OF STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS OF AN IMPROVED BRAKE CYLINDER OF A FREIGHT CAR OF RAILWAY TRANSPORT ON ITS LOAD IN OPERATION, EUREKA, Physics and Engineering, 2022, 6, pp. 45-55, (2022); Aerospace Materials and Applications, (2018); Kombarov, Volodymyr, Numerical control of fiberglass pipe bends manufacturing, pp. 357-362, (2021); Tiwary, Akash, A review on characteristics of composite and advanced materials used for aerospace applications, Materials Today: Proceedings, 51, pp. 865-870, (2021); Schubert, Martin, Multifunctional and lightweight load-bearing composite structures for satellites, MATEC Web of Conferences, 233, (2018); Slyvynskyi, V.

The present study investigated the mechanical properties of a coprinted hybrid scaffold made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and an alginate-based hydrogel, which was conceived to possess a double function of in vivo bio-integration (due to the ability of the hydrogel to release lyosecretome, a freeze-dried formulation of mesenchymal stem cell secretome with osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties) and withstanding loads (due to the presence of polycaprolactone, which provides mechanical resistance). To this end, an in-silico study was conducted to predict mechanical properties. Structural finite element analysis (FEA) of the hybrid scaffold under compression was performed to compare the numerical results with the corresponding experimental data. The impact of alginate inclusion and infill patterns on scaffold stiffness was investigated. Results show an increase in mechanical properties by changing the scaffold infill pattern (linear: 145.38±28.90 vs. honeycomb: 278.96±50.19, mean and standard deviation, n = 8), while alginate inclusion does not always impact the mechanical performance of the hybrid scaffold (stiffness: 145.38±28.90 vs. 195.42±38.68 N/mm, with vs without hydrogel inclusion, respectively). This is confirmed by FEA analysis, in which a good correspondence between experimental and numerical stiffness is shown (142±28.94 vs. 117.18, respectively, linear scaffold with hydrogel inclusion). In conclusion, the computational framework is a valid tool for predicting the mechanical performance of scaffolds and is promising for future clinical applications in the maxillofacial field. © 2023","3D coprinting; Bone tissue engineering; Computational model; Finite element analysis; Mechanical characterization; MSC-secretome","3D printing; Alginate; Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Bone; Cell culture; Forecasting; Hydrogels; Infill drilling; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; Stiffness; Tissue regeneration; 3d coprinting; Bone tissue engineering; Computational modelling; Finite element analyse; Hybrid scaffolds; Mechanical characterizations; Mechanical performance; MSC-secretome; Secretome; Structural finite elements; Finite element method; alginic acid; hydrogel; polycaprolactone; polyester; Article; bone defect; bone tissue; compression; computer model; finite element analysis; force; human; in vivo study; mesenchymal stem cell; secretome; surface property; three dimensional printing; tissue regeneration; bone regeneration; chemistry; procedures; tissue engineering; Alginates; Bone Regeneration; Finite Element Analysis; Polyesters; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds","Alaribe, Franca Nneka, Scaffolds from biomaterials: Advantages and limitations in bone and tissue engineering, Biologia, 71, 4, pp. 353-366, (2016); Ang, Ker Chin, Compressive properties and degradability of poly(ε-caprolatone)/ hydroxyapatite composites under accelerated hydrolytic degradation, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part A, 80, 3, pp. 655-660, (2007); Bari, Elia, Freeze-dried secretome (Lyosecretome) from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells promotes the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of titanium cages, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 22, 16, (2021); Bari, Elia, 3d bioprinted scaffolds containing mesenchymal stem/stromal lyosecretome: Next generation controlled release device for bone regenerative medicine, Pharmaceutics, 13, 4, (2021); Bari, Elia, Three-Dimensional Bioprinted Controlled Release Scaffold Containing Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Lyosecretome for Bone Regeneration: Sterile Manufacturing and In Vitro Biological Efficacy, Biomedicines, 10, 5, (2022); Chen, Pengfei, Desktop-stereolithography 3D printing of a radially oriented extracellular matrix/mesenchymal stem cell exosome bioink for osteochondral defect regeneration, Theranostics, 9, 9, pp. 2439-2459, (2019); Collins, Maurice N., Scaffold Fabrication Technologies and Structure/Function Properties in Bone Tissue Engineering, Advanced Functional Materials, 31, 21, (2021); Diomede, Francesca, Three-dimensional printed PLA scaffold and human gingival stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles: A new tool for bone defect repair, Stem Cell Research and Therapy, 9, 1, (2018); Eshraghi, Shaun, Mechanical and microstructural properties of polycaprolactone scaffolds with one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional orthogonally oriented porous architectures produced by selective laser sintering, Acta Biomaterialia, 6, 7, pp. 2467-2476, (2010); Hu, Duo, 3D bioprinting of cell-laden scaffolds for intervertebral disc regeneration, Materials Letters, 223, pp. 219-222, (2018)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Six kinds of target plate structures with different configurations were prepared by changing the hard segment content and coating position of polyurethane elastomer. The first-stage light gas gun device is used to conduct impact experiments at various speeds, and the finite element simulation computation is performed using LS-DYNA. Based on the experimental and finite element results, the ballistic limit velocity and specific energy absorption of different target configurations were analyzed, and the failure forms, damage areas, and failure mechanisms were discussed. The findings demonstrate that the polyurethane elastomer coating enhances the honeycomb sandwich structure's ballistic limit performance by 40.6% to 51% and that the honeycomb core of the target plate with the coating on the front panel has a larger area of collapse. This fully exploits the benefits of the honeycomb structure in the energy absorption process and makes up for the weaknesses of the honeycomb sandwich structure's subpar energy absorption effect under local impact loads. Therefore, the front panel coating has better ballistic limit performance. The coated polyurethane with medium hardness demonstrated the best ballistic limit performance for the various polyurethane hardness. The ballistic limit speeds of the front panel and back panel coatings increased by 51% and 48.8% respectively, in comparison to the uncoated target plate. After comparing the structure of polyurea coating, it is found that the ballistic limit performance of polyurethane coating with medium hardness is higher than that of polyurea coating structure, and the negative growth of the ballistic limit performance of the whole structure caused by the coating of rigid polyurea on the back panel is effectively avoided. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Ballistic limit; Hard segment content; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Penetration; Polyurethane elastomer","Ballistics; Elastomers; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Hardness; Honeycomb structures; Plastics; Plates (structural components); Polyurethanes; Sandwich structures; Structure (composition); Ballistic Limit; Composites structures; Hard segment content; Hard segments; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Penetration; Performance; Polyurea coatings; Polyurethane elastomers; Target plates; Coatings","Fiber Compos, (2000); Warren, Justin M., Hypervelocity Impacts on Honeycomb Core Sandwich Panels Filled with Shear Thickening Fluid, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 150, (2021); Gu, Zhoupeng, Dynamic compressive behaviour of sandwich panels with lattice truss core filled by shear thickening fluid, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 143, (2020); Wadley, Hayden N.G., Effect of core topology on projectile penetration in hybrid aluminum/alumina sandwich structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 62, pp. 99-113, (2013); Palomba, Giulia, Single and double-layer honeycomb sandwich panels under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 121, pp. 77-90, (2018); Ni, Changye, Normal and oblique projectile impact of double-layered pyramidal lattice truss structures filled with ceramic insertions, Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials, 30, 8, pp. 1136-1156, (2017); Wang, Zhonggang, Mechanical behavior of composited structure filled with tandem honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 114, pp. 128-138, (2017); Yuan, Hui, The failure behavior of double-layer metal foam sandwich beams under three-point bending, Thin-Walled Structures, 180, (2022); Xue, Debo, Study on compression characteristics of honeycomb sandwich structure with multistage carbon fiber reinforced composites, Polymer Composites, 43, 9, pp. 6252-6264, (2022); Bi, Guangjian, Impact Resistance Analysis of a Composite Double-Layer Honeycomb Sandwich Structure, Strength of Materials, 53, 1, pp. 126-133, (2021)",""

This study proposes a novel 3DSTH based on 2DSTH. 3DSTH specimens were manufactured by the 3D printing process, and quasi-static compressive tests were implemented to verify the reliability of the established finite element model. Numerical results show that 3DSTH exhibits a typical negative Poisson's ratio effect under in-plane compression, and the cells near the platens bend and collapse in the out-of-plane direction. The theoretical analytical formulas of elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were derived according to the deformation mechanism of the typical cell. The theoretical prediction results match the numerical simulation results accurately. In addition, the parameter analysis shows that the elastic modulus decreases firstly and then increases with the increase in the inclined angle, showing a quadratic parabolic relationship. However, the Poisson's ratio only increases monotonically with the increase in the inclined angle. Subsequently, the angle and thickness gradients of 3DSTH with different distribution patterns were constructed. The influences of gradient distribution on deformation mode and energy-absorbing characteristics of 3DSTH were studied by performing a comparative analysis. The bidirectional gradient distribution is more conducive to improving the deformation stability and energy absorption characteristics of 3DSTH than the unidirectional gradient distribution. Moreover, 3DSTH exhibits more excellent deformation mode and energy absorption characteristics, approximately 25.45% higher than that of 2DSTH with the same geometric parameters.

The finite element model was developed in ABAQUS, and different variables were parameterised to aim a quick implementation. The empty aluminium honeycomb crash box is used as a term of comparison with the foam-filled ones.

Stiffened sandwich panels have broad application to improve bending and torsional stiffness of the automotive, aerospace, and marine body structures and their crashworthiness durability. In this study, analytical bending characteristics and elastic response equations for each introduced stiffened hexagon honeycomb panel were derived when subjected to transverse quasi-static impact loading. These equations are based on the theory of curved laminated beams, the classical lamination method, and the Tsai-Hill failure theory. The employed finite element method (FEM) and the performed digital image correlation low-velocity impact tests demonstrated that the present analytical bending characteristics equations can reasonably predict the elastic behavior of stiffened hexagon honeycomb panels with an accuracy of more than 80%. As a result of quasi-static impact loading, stiffened CFRP hexagon honeycomb panel equipped with corrugated plate cores showed a positive elastic behavior of more than 89% compared to the non-stiffened traditional honeycomb unit. In addition, the effect of corrugation on the Tsai-Hill failure index of corrugated core CFRP honeycombs decreased with layer thickness enhancement because it is more proximate to the same configuration as flat plates. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University.","Corrugated cores; Digital image correlation processing; Hexagon honeycombs; Quasi-static impact; Stiffened panels","","Ali, Mudassir, Effect of Patch Repair on the Physical and Mechanical Properties of Carbon Bidirectional Reinforced Composites, Iranian Journal of Science and Technology - Transactions of Mechanical Engineering, 47, 2, pp. 569-581, (2023); Azimpour-Shishevan, Farzin, Effects of Thermal Shock Cycling on Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Carbon/Basalt Fiber-Reinforced Intraply Hybrid Composites, Iranian Journal of Science and Technology - Transactions of Mechanical Engineering, 43, pp. 441-449, (2019); Chen, Shanxiang, Size-dependent nonlinear bending behavior of porous FGM quasi-3D microplates with a central cutout based on nonlocal strain gradient isogeometric finite element modelling, Engineering with Computers, 37, 2, pp. 1657-1678, (2021); Chen, Yuan, Progressive failure of CFRP tubes reinforced with composite sandwich panels: Numerical analysis and energy absorption, Composite Structures, 263, (2021); Kassapoǵlou, Christos, Design and Analysis of Composite Structures: With Applications to Aerospace Structures, (2010); Duodu, Enock A., Comparison of Ballistic Impact Behavior of Carbon Fiber/Epoxy Composite and Steel Metal Structures, Iranian Journal of Science and Technology - Transactions of Mechanical Engineering, 42, 1, pp. 13-22, (2018); Erbayrak, Engin, An Experimental and Numerical Determination on Low-Velocity Impact Response of Hybrid Composite Laminate, Iranian Journal of Science and Technology - Transactions of Mechanical Engineering, 45, 3, pp. 665-681, (2021); Farrokhabadi, A., Experimental and numerical analysis of novel multi-layer sandwich panels under three point bending load, Composite Structures, 250, (2020); Fazel, Dara, Failure Procedure in Epoxy Adhesive Joining Composite Plates, Iranian Journal of Science and Technology - Transactions of Mechanical Engineering, 45, 2, pp. 337-350, (2021); Ge, Lei, Compression behavior of a novel sandwich structure with bi-directional corrugated core, Thin-Walled Structures, 161, (2021)",""

When the vehicle’s dead weight is decreased, its overall economy improves. Composite materials made up of many polymers have found use in the automotive industry. This study’s principal purpose is to validate a sandwich architecture that can be utilized in battery housing for EVs. Which aims to design a sandwich composite structure that is 10-15% lighter than a comparable state-of-the-art solution. This is accomplished by testing the physical and experimental characteristics of composite material for a new sandwich architecture where the core of the sandwich is made of a foam-packed 3D-printed honeycomb structure and natural fiber laminates are utilized as the sandwich structure’s face sheets. The core is 3D printed utilizing FDM technology with a lattice honeycomb structure, printed using Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) thermoplastic polymer. Where a hexagonal-cell composite is less in weight and absorbs more energy than solid composites. Also, flax fiber laminate is used as a face sheet for sandwich composites.

The relative density of the bionic core is firstly defined, which is closely related to cell configuration and geometric parameters. Through finite element simulations supported by experiments using 3D printed specimens, the novel bionic core is found to be superior in crashworthiness as compared to conventional honeycomb core in terms of specific energy absorption and mean force under out-of-plane compression. To decipher the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced performances, a theoretical model for the bionic core is derived based on the simplified super folding element (SSFE) theory. The effects of wall thickness, number of cells and amplitude of sinusoidal beam on relative density and crashworthiness are explored. It is revealed that the increase in wall thickness and number of cells led to improvements of load bearing capacity. An optimal structure is subsequently obtained based on the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) and response surface method (RSM). Compared to conventional honeycomb core, the optimal peak force of the bionic core is decreased by 11.53%.

To effectively verify the reliability of the simulation analysis, quasi-static compression experiments were conducted on 3D-printed specimens. The results of the study showed that the first-order Koch hierarchical honeycomb structure increased the specific energy absorption by 27.52% compared to the conventional honeycomb structure. Furthermore, the highest specific energy absorption can be obtained by increasing the hierarchical order to 2. Moreover, the energy absorption of triangular and square hierarchies can be significantly increased.

Dynamic penetration process, failure mechanisms, ballistic limit velocity, and perforation energy threshold of polyurea-coated sandwich panels are firstly elucidated via experiments and then compared with those of non-coated sandwich panels. Subsequently, based upon a user-defined compressible model of polyurea, three-dimensional finite element (FE) simulations of both non-coated and coated sandwich panels are carried out to analyze the ballistic impact response, interrogate the energy absorption mechanisms, and assess the influence of coating position/thickness and projectile rigidity on ballistic performance. Excellent agreement between experimental measurements and numerical predictions is achieved. It is demonstrated that the presence of a sufficiently thick (e.g., ∼15 mm) impact-side elastomeric coating helps to curtail the kinetic energy of flat-ended projectiles, thus enhancing the penetration resistance considerably. The use of a thicker and impact-side coating is favored owing to its superior energy absorption capability. It is also ascertained that the effectiveness of polyurea coating in resisting rigid, flat-ended projectiles is much more remarkable relative to deformable, conical ones. Further, retrofitting an all-metallic sandwich panel with elastomeric coating broadens its multifunctionality significantly, enabling it to simultaneously carry structural loads, mitigate impact and blast loadings, and resist projectile penetration, at a minimal increase in fabrication cost and structural mass. The insights of this study provide a potential new avenue for enhancing the ballistic impact resistance as well as multifunctional attributes of all-metallic sandwich construction. © 2023","Ballistic resistance; Corrugated core; Elastomeric coating; Energy absorption; Sandwich panel","Coatings; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Ballistic impact; Ballistic resistance; Corrugated core; Elastomeric coatings; Impact response; Metallics; Penetration process; Polyureas; Process failure; Sandwich panel; Energy absorption","Karasakal, Orhan, Anti-ship missile defense for a naval task group, Naval Research Logistics, 58, 3, pp. 304-321, (2011); Yu, Runpei, Stress state sensitivity for plastic flow and ductile fracture of L907A low-alloy marine steel: From tension to shear, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 835, (2022); Li, Xue, Plastic deformation and ductile fracture of L907A ship steel at increasing strain rate and temperature, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 174, (2023); Li, Ying, Dynamic response of stiffened plate under internal blast: Experimental and numerical investigation, Marine Structures, 77, (2021); Jin, Jian, Experimental study on the combined damage of liquid cabin structure subjected to charge explosion with preset fragments, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 130, pp. 19-26, (2019); Kong, Xiangshao, Experimental and numerical investigation on a multi-layer protective structure under the synergistic effect of blast and fragment loadings, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 65, pp. 146-162, (2014); Zhang, Lei, Research advance of damage load of surface ship cabin explosion, Scientia Sinica: Physica, Mechanica et Astronomica, 51, 12, (2020); Du, Zhipeng, Research on the mechanical characteristics of the Z-type target plate of the warhead entirely penetrating the ship simulation structure, Scientia Sinica: Physica, Mechanica et Astronomica, 51, 12, (2021); Grisaro, Hezi Y., Characteristics of combined blast and fragments loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 116, pp. 51-64, (2018); Kong, Xiangshao, A numerical investigation on explosive fragmentation of metal casing using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic method, Materials and Design, 51, pp. 729-741, (2013)",""

A finite element (FE) model is developed using the software package of ABAQUS and used to investigate the effect of both considering and ignoring the time-dependent behavior of composite laminate facesheets as well as the foam core. Material constitutive equations, damage characteristics, and failure modes are defined in a FORTRAN user-subroutine VUMAT. To characterize the material behavior of both polyurethane foam and glass/epoxy composite material, a set of experimental tests are conducted under compression, tension, and stress relaxation modes. To validate the numerical results, low-velocity impact tests at two energy levels of 9.81 and 17 joules are carried out on sandwich panels with foam core. The results of numerical simulations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental test results. It is shown that ignoring the viscoelastic properties in the composite laminate and the foam core can lead to deviations of up to 7% and 25%, respectively, from experimental results. The analysis reveals that, ignoring the viscoelastic behavior along the fiber-direction in the composite facesheets does no change the results considerably. The viscoelastic properties perpendicular to the fibers, however, has a more noticeable effect on the results due to the prevalence of the properties of the polymeric resin in that direction. © The Author(s) 2023.","Composite sandwich panels; low-velocity impact damage; mechanical characterization; simulation; viscoelastic behavior","ABAQUS; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Laminated composites; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Stress relaxation; Viscoelasticity; Composite sandwich panels; Face sheets; Foam core; Low velocity impact; Low-velocity impact damage; Mechanical characterizations; Sandwich panel; Simulation; Viscoelastic behaviors; Viscoelastic properties; Constitutive equations","Yang, Peng, Evaluation of temperature effects on low velocity impact damage in composite sandwich panels with polymeric foam cores, Composite Structures, 129, pp. 213-223, (2015); Sadeghnejad, Soroush, Modeling, characterization and parametric identification of low velocity impact behavior of time-dependent hyper-viscoelastic sandwich panels, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 233, 4, pp. 622-636, (2019); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of slender multilayer sandwich beams with metal foam cores subjected to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 153, pp. 614-623, (2016); Poveda, Ronald Leonel, Viscoelastic properties of carbon nanofiber reinforced multiscale syntactic foam, Composites Part B: Engineering, 58, pp. 208-216, (2014); Can, Wang, Experimental investigation of interfacial fracture behavior in foam core sandwich beams with visco-elastic adhesive interface, Composite Structures, 92, 5, pp. 1085-1091, (2010); Kosedag, Ertan, Low-velocity and ballistic impact resistances of particle reinforced metal–matrix composites: An experimental study, Journal of Composite Materials, 56, 7, pp. 991-1002, (2022); Crupi, Vincenzo, Prediction model for the impact response of glass fibre reinforced aluminium foam sandwiches, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 77, pp. 97-107, (2015); Nasirzadeh, Rasoul, Study of foam density variations in composite sandwich panels under high velocity impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 63, pp. 129-139, (2014); Brinson, Hal F., Polymer engineering science and viscoelasticity: An introduction, Second edition, pp. 1-482, (2015); Gutierrez-Lemini, Danton, Engineering viscoelasticity, pp. 1-353, (2014)",""

In the present study, for enhanced blast resistance, ultralight all-metallic sandwich panels with square honeycomb cores are proposed as an alternative to traditional metallic plates for ship construction. A combined experimental and numerical approach is employed to investigate the dynamic responses of fully-clamped sandwich panel subjected to fully confined blast loading and compare its blast resistance to that of its monolithic counterpart having equal mass. To explore the underlying physical mechanisms, finite element simulations with the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) approach are performed. The simulation results are validated against experimental measurements for both sandwich and monolithic target plates, with good agreement achieved. It is demonstrated that, with the pressure versus time history on target plate featured by multiple reflected overpressures and a long-duration quasi-static phase with considerably lower pressure amplitude, the proposed sandwich panel exhibits a considerably higher blast resistance than its monolithic counterpart of equal areal density placed at the same standoff distance, due mainly to its consumption of impact energy via global out-of-plane bending, in-plane stretching, and localized core crushing.

Meanwhile, Triangular sandwich Panel (TP), Corrugated sandwich Panel (CP) and Elliptical arc sandwich Panel (EP) are accordingly designed as a comparison. Hyperworks and LS-DYNA are used to simulate the impact conditions, and the drop-weight test shows that the finite element simulation is reliable. Bionic sandwich panels have excellent protective effect at the impact velocity of 6-14m/s. UABP has the best comprehensive impact resistance by comparing the deformation, specific energy absorption (SEA) and peak force (PF) of the five kinds of sandwich panels under five impact velocities. Parameter analysis and response surface optimization work based on orthogonal experiments are carried out for UABP, the results are that the wall thickness T and the triangle-width ratio λ2 have extremely significant influences on the SEA, and the order of influence is T>λ2; the wall thickness T and the arc-width ratio λ1 have extremely influences on PF, and the triangle-width ratio λ2 has a significant influence on PF, and the order of influence is T>λ1>λ2. Both the errors about SEA and PF of the optimal solutions are less than 5%. The comprehensive evaluation index of the optimal UABP is larger than that of sandwich panels by 29.15%, 52.61%, 65.64%, 40.5%.

First, sandwiches with various specifications were subjected to low-velocity impact tests with an energy of 34 J. Then reinforcing effect of the pins and the specimen damage condition were thoroughly evaluated using finite element analysis (FEA). The findings revealed that the enhancement impact was substantial when position parameters were below a value of one and was negligible when position parameters were greater than three. In addition, the deformation and damage patterns of the pins gradually transitioned from crushing to large curvature bending, micro-buckling, and negligible deformation were observed with increasing values of position parameters. To establish the law associating position and dimensional parameters with impact performance (including maximum contact force, resistance to impact damage, perforation threshold energy and dent depth), experiments were designed by the central composite design (CCD) method and simulated through FEA. The analysis of variance revealed that the position parameter have higher significance on the maximum contact force, damage resistance and perforation threshold energy, while the dimensional parameter have higher significance on the dent depth. Finally, a parameter optimization design approach was proposed that increased the sandwich's perforation resistance and damage resistance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Finite element analysis (FEA); Foam core sandwich structure; Low-velocity impact behavior; Pin-reinforced","Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Dimensional parameters; Finite element analyse; Foam core sandwich structures; Impact performance; Impactors; Low velocity impact; Low velocity impact behaviors; Pin-reinforced; Position parameters; Finite element method","Ha, Ngoc-san, A review of recent research on bio-inspired structures and materials for energy absorption applications, Composites Part B: Engineering, 181, (2020); Li, Hao, Broadband low-frequency vibration attenuation in 3D printed composite meta-lattice sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 215, (2021); Faidzi, M.

The relative densities of traditional concave hexagonal honeycomb structures and three other classes of concave hexagonal honeycomb structures were derived using the geometric structure. The impact critical velocity of the structures was derived by using the 1-D impact theory. The in-plane impact characteristics and deformation modes of three kinds of similar concave hexagonal honeycomb structures in the concave direction at low, medium, and high velocity were analyzed using the finite element software ABAQUS. The results showed that the honeycomb structure of the cells of the three types undergoes two stages: concave hexagons and parallel quadrilaterals, at low velocity. For this reason, there are two stress platforms in the process of strain. With the increase in the velocity, the joints and middle of some cells form a glue-linked structure due to inertia. No excessive parallelogram structure appears, resulting in the blurring or even disappearance of the second stress platform. Finally, effects of different structural parameters on the plateau stress and energy absorption of structures similar to concave hexagons were obtained during low impact. The results provide a powerful reference for the negative Poisson’s ratio honeycomb structure under multi-directional impact. © 2023 by the authors.","concave direction impact; honeycomb structure; in-plane impact; similar concave hexagon; specific energy absorption; stress plateau","ABAQUS; Energy absorption; Concave direction impact; Geometric structure; Hexagonal honeycomb; Impact performance; In-plane impact; Low-velocity; Relative density; Similar concave hexagon; Specific energy absorption; Stress plateau; Honeycomb structures","Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Grima, Joseph N., Auxetic behavior from rotating squares, Journal of Materials Science Letters, 19, 17, pp. 1563-1565, (2000); Lakes, Roderic S., Deformation mechanisms in negative Poisson's ratio materials: structural aspects, Journal of Materials Science, 26, 9, pp. 2287-2292, (1991); Taylor, Michael, Low porosity metallic periodic structures with negative poisson's ratio, Advanced Materials, 26, 15, pp. 2365-2370, (2014); Zeng, Wei, Investigation on the dynamic behavior of composite gradient double-arrow auxetic structure under local impact load, Polymer Composites, 43, 5, pp. 3068-3084, (2022); An isotropic three-dimensional structure with Poisson's ratio =-1, Journal of Elasticity, 15, 4, pp. 427-430, (1985); Li, Jun, Laboratory tests on engineering properties of a new negative-Poisson′s-ratio geobelt, Construction and Building Materials, 297, (2021); Mardling, Paul, The use of auxetic materials in tissue engineering, Biomaterials Science, 8, 8, pp. 2074-2083, (2020); Budarapu, Pattabhi Ramaiah, Design concepts of an aircraft wing: composite and morphing airfoil with auxetic structures, Frontiers of Structural and Civil Engineering, 10, 4, pp. 394-408, (2016); Alderson, Kim Lesley, Auxetic warp knit textile structures, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 249, 7, pp. 1322-1329, (2012)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

All three-sandwich structures comprised of Al 1100-H12 face skins and Al -3003 H12 honeycomb core. For the direct comparison, the radius and thickness of all three-sandwich structures were kept identical. The high velocity impact tests were performed by using a pneumatic air gun. The hemispherical and conical shape projectiles were impacted typically at the centre (axis) of the sandwich structures with varying impact velocity. The finite element simulations were carried out through commercially available software Abaqus/explicit. The numerically obtained test results were validated through the experimental results to check the accuracy of the modelling. The response of all three structures was examined by comparing their ballistic resistance, failure mechanics and energy absorption characteristics. In addition, the parametric study was conducted numerically by changing the face skin thickness, cell length and cell wall thickness to find out their influence on the impact response of all three structures. The results revealed that the hemispherical structures showed higher impact resistance in terms of higher ballistic limit velocity and energy absorption.

The MCSCS sandwich panel employed stiffeners and headed studs to improve the bonding behavior between faceplates and concrete core as well as enhance its composite action and impact resistance. Impact tests were conducted on seven MCSCS panels via employing a drop weight loading system, and the influences of impact direction, spacing of headed stud and steel plate thickness on responses of MCSCS panels were investigated. Furthermore, the Finite Element (FE) model of the MCSCS panel was established, and the FE predictions were shown to be reasonable as compared to test results. Two types of failure modes of MCSCS panels under impact load were obtained via analyzing the test and FE results. In addition, based on the verified FE model, the influences of stiffeners, impact location and curvature of hammer head on impact responses of MCSCS panels were revealed via parametric studies. The results of FE simulations indicated that the impact location and curvature of hammer head had evident effect on the energy absorption and impact response of the MCSCS panel.

The EC was found to effectively dissipate impact energy via the plastic deformation of pleated steel plates and the compression of aluminum foam fillers. The steel-concrete-steel (SCS) panel showed the combination of global and local deformation under impact loading. Moreover, the influences of pleated plate thickness (t<inf>p</inf>) and angle (θ<inf>p</inf>), aluminum foam filler and initial momentum on the impact performances of the SCS-EC were studied quantitatively.

However, the composite face sheets are highly vulnerable to impact loads and cause damage to the structure based on the impact energy. This study investigates the structural response of HSS with CFRP face sheets under quasi-static indentation and a wide range of impact energy: low to high velocity impact. A finite-element model was developed and numerical simulations were carried out at various impact energies, thereby providing deeper insights into the impact dynamics and understanding various damage states such as dent, front face sheet perforation, core damage and rear face sheet penetration. The numerical simulation result was compared with the experimentally tested HSS using a single-stage gas gun under 53.6 J to validate the finite-element model in terms of deformation and damage status. A quasi-static indentation test was conducted and numerically predicted force data under impact test for the complete perforation case was compared to address the dependency of rate of loading. The carbon nanotube (CNT) with various weight percentages (wt%), such as 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, was added to the matrix system through a vacuum assisted resin transfer technique and experiments were conducted at 79, 107 and 135 J. The impact resistance increases with CNT addition and hence no perforation was recorded for all the test cases of 0.6 wt% CNT addition. The influence of CNT addition on the damage area is more on the bottom face sheet and a 57% reduction in damage area was recorded for the case of 0.6 wt% CNT addition at 135 J impact energy when compared to the neat carbon/epoxy composite. © IMechE 2022.","carbon nanotubes; CFRP; Impact; quasi-static indentation; sandwich","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Indentation; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Composite faces; Face sheets; High-velocity impact; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact; Impact energy; Quasi-static indentation; Sandwich; Structural response; Carbon nanotubes","Khan, Muhammad A., Experimental and numerical analysis of flexural and impact behaviour of glass/pp sandwich panel for automotive structural applications, Advanced Composite Materials, 27, 4, pp. 367-386, (2018); Mahesh, Vishwas, A comprehensive review on material selection for polymer matrix composites subjected to impact load, Defence Technology, 17, 1, pp. 257-277, (2021); Muniraj, D., Damage assessment of sandwich structures with Al/SiC functionally graded plasma sprayed faceplates subjected to single and repeated impacts, Composite Structures, 287, (2022); Wang, Bing, High velocity impact response of composite lattice core sandwich structures, Applied Composite Materials, 21, 2, pp. 377-389, (2014); Yokozeki, Tomohiro, Damage characterization and numerical modeling of titanium matrix composites subjected to low-velocity impact for landing gear application, Advanced Composite Materials, 24, 4, pp. 343-358, (2015); Schröder, Silvio, Development of a Marslander with crushable shock absorber by virtual and experimental testing, Acta Astronautica, 134, pp. 65-74, (2017); Muniraj, D., Experimental damage evaluation of honeycomb sandwich with composite face sheets under impact load, International Journal of Engineering, Transactions A: Basics, 34, 4, pp. 999-1007, (2021); Guida, Michele, Analysis of bird impact on a composite tailplane leading edge, Applied Composite Materials, 15, 4-6, pp. 241-257, (2008); Ferreira, José A.M., Impact response of nano reinforced mat glass/epoxy laminates, Fibers and Polymers, 16, 1, pp. 173-180, (2015); Ma, Pibo, Transverse impact characterization of carbon woven fabric-foam sandwich composites with carbon nanotubes, Fibers and Polymers, 15, 7, pp. 1560-1566, (2014)",""

Three bio-inspired hierarchical honeycombs (BHHs) with different topologies are designed by replacing each vertex of square honeycombs with smaller arc-shaped structures. The effects of hierarchical topologies and multi-material layout on in-plane dynamic crushings and absorbed-energy capacities of the BHHs are explored based on the explicit finite element (FE) analysis. Different deformation modes can be observed from the BHHs, which mainly depend upon hierarchical topologies and impact velocities. According to energy efficiency method and one-dimensional (1D) shock theory, calculation formulas of densification strains and plateau stresses for the BHHs are derived to characterize the dynamic bearing capacity, which is consistent well with FE results. Compared with conventional honeycombs, the crushing load efficiency and energy absorption capacity of the BHHs can be improved by changing the proper hierarchical topology and multi-material layout.

For the numerical calculation, nine nodes are considered for each element. A specialized MATLAB code is developed incorporating the present mathematical model to evaluate the numerical buckling temperature. The Green–Lagrange nonlinear strain is adopted for the formulation of the sandwich structure. The eigenvalue equation of the FG sandwich structure is solved to predict the post-buckling temperature values of the structure. Moreover, three kinds of temperature distributions across the panel thickness are assumed, viz., uniform, linear and nonlinear. In addition, the properties are described using the power law distributions. The numerical solutions are first validated and, subsequently, the impact of alterations of structural parameters, viz., the curvature ratios, core–face thickness ratios, support conditions and power law index (n<inf>Z</inf>) including the amplitude ratio on the thermal post-buckling response of FG sandwich curved panels have been studied in details.

Impact loadings are implemented repeatedly with a steel hemisphere impactor for various impact energies, 7.28 J, 9.74 J, and 12.63 J.

The sandwich beam can resist up to 5 continual impacts at 7.28 J and 9.74 J but only up to 3 times repeated loads at 12.63 J before visible failure is noticed. In the examination of several key impact performance indicators under numerous loading cases, the proposed beam demonstrates favorably up to 1.3-11.2 higher impact resistance efficacies compared to existing designs, therefore displaying an improvement in repeated impact resistance of the new design. © © 2023 Techno-Press, Ltd.","arched core; bio-inspired; composite structure; computational simulation; repeated impact; sandwich beam","ABAQUS; Arches; Biomimetics; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Composite beams and girders; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Arched core; Bi-layer; Bio-inspired; Composites structures; Computational simulation; Impact loadings; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Repeated impact; Sandwich beams; Adhesives","Abaqus Analysis Users Guide Volume IV Elements, (2016); Abo Sabah, Saddam Hussein, Comparative low-velocity impact behavior of bio-inspired and conventional sandwich composite beams, Composites Science and Technology, 149, pp. 64-74, (2017); Abo Sabah, Saddam Hussein, Bio-inspired vs. conventional sandwich beams: A low-velocity repeated impact behavior exploration, Construction and Building Materials, 169, pp. 193-204, (2018); Abo Sabah, Saddam Hussein, Failure mode maps of bio-inspired sandwich beams under repeated low-velocity impact, Composites Science and Technology, 182, (2019); Abrate, Serge, Localized impact on sandwich structures with laminated facings, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 50, 2, pp. 69-82, (1997); al-Fasih, M.

In this study, the graded re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs (RECH) were proposed, and their metallic prototypes were fabricated through a low-cost step-by-step method. The novel design of graded RECH takes advantage of structural hierarchy on the meso-scale and functional gradient on the macro-scale. The in-plane crushing behaviors of uniform (U) RECH, positive gradient (PG) RECH and negative gradient (NG) RECH with the same relative density were investigated under different crushing velocities. The finite element (FE) models were validated by comparing against the experimental and theoretical results. The results showed that the gradient design can control the multi-step deformation modes of RECH, which leads to the multi-plateau characteristics and reduced initial stress peaks in stress-strain curves. Under quasi-static crushing, the specific energy absorption (SEA) of PG-RECH is higher by 43.9% than that of U-RECH owing to more plastic deformations of hierarchical circular walls at a large strain. Under dynamic impacts, the SEA of NG-RECH is 2.7 times and 1.5 times those of PG-RECH and U-RECH at a small strain, respectively. Finally, the NG-RECH shows more negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) behavior than the U-RECH under dynamic crushing.

In this study, finite element (FE) models are successfully established to gain insight into the collision between a modified barge and a three-column bridge pier in the non-navigable zone. Firstly, numerical models of the bridge pier and barge are satisfactorily verified against experimental results, through which the dynamic performance of the bridge under typical collision scenarios is investigated with respect to the kinetic energy, internal energy, and impact force. A new performance index, i.e., internal energy power slope (IEPS), calculated from the second derivative of the structural internal energy, is then proposed to prescribe the damage states of the impacted column. The usefulness and applicability of the IEPS are further explored through structural reliability analysis and a parametric study. Moreover, the efficacy of two protective jackets made in alloy honeycomb (AH) and aluminum foam (AF) for enhancing the structural anti-impact capacity is investigated by comparing the associated values of IEPS. It is observed that the proposed IEPS has a strong correlation with the structural damage state, and thus can be favourably used as a new performance metric for analyzing barge-pier collisions. The results also evidence that adopting UHPC (ultra-high performance concrete), densifying stirrup spacing, and adding protective jackets are effective measures to reduce the IEPS and hence improve the structural anti-impact capacity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Barge-pier collision; Finite element method; IEPS (Internal energy power slope); Protective jacket; Reliability; Triple-column bridge pier","Barges; High performance concrete; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Piers; Reliability analysis; Anti impacts; Barge-pier collision; Damage state; Dynamic performance; Energies (power); Impact capacity; Internal energies; Internal energy power slope; Protective jackets; Triple-column bridge pier; Finite element method; barge; bridge construction; collision avoidance; column; finite element method","Guide Specification and Commentary for Vessel Collision Design of Highway Bridges, (2025); Lrfd Bridge Design Specifications, (2004); Alsos, Hagbart Skage, On the resistance of tanker bottom structures during stranding, Marine Structures, 20, 4, pp. 218-237, (2007); Aldosary, Muhannad Haqi, Structural reliability and stochastic finite element methods: State-of-the-art review and evidence-based comparison, Engineering Computations, 35, 6, pp. 2165-2214, (2018); Ambriz, R.

The uniform re-entrant triangular honeycomb URT (λ = 1) and the gradient re-entrant triangular honeycomb GRT (λ = 2, 3, 4, 5) were obtained by defining the thickness ratio λ. The in-plane dynamic crushing behavior of the novel honeycomb was investigated using the finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. The results showed that the cells of both honeycombs underwent two deformation stages under low-and medium-velocity impacts. As for the overall deformation mode, the URT exhibited a significant negative Poisson's ratio phenomenon, and the GRT showed only small necking. The theoretical models for the plateau stress of the URT under low-and high-velocity impacts were established based on the conservation of energy and linear momentum principles. Then, the equations for the plateau stress of the GRT were derived using the linear superposition principle. Under a low-velocity impact, both the plateau stress and SEA of the GRT remained positively correlated with λ, and the maximum values were 39.2% and 52.9% greater than those of the URT.

To this end, a new three-dimensional finite element (FE) model was implemented. The model accounts for the constitutive response of the GFRP sandwich skins and the crushable foam by means of two subroutines. A previously developed analytical model was used to support and complete the results of the FE model. Experimental data were also used to validate both models in the vicinity of the ballistic limit for the neutral configuration (same number of plies on the front and rear face skins). Thus, the most appropriate configuration to improve the ballistic limit for a structure with the same material (same number of plies) was obtained by testing different distributions of laminae. The ballistic limit was then estimated for all the possible configurations and the energy-absorption mechanisms were analysed to reveal new insights into the behaviour of these structures when the neutral configuration is varied. In addition, the damaged areas of the specimens were compared between the experiments and the model. As a result, the most suitable configuration turned out to be associated with thicker rear face skins, which produce higher ballistic limits. The largest fraction of the energy was absorbed by the out-of-plane mechanisms, this behaviour being maintained in all the configurations. Experimental observations established that the damaged area of the front face skin was smaller than the damage produced in the rear face skin and that bending effects were notable in the latter. The affected areas were proved to have a round shape, presenting the largest size in the vicinity of the ballistic limit. © 2023 The Authors","Analytical modelling; Energy-absorption; Foam; High-velocity impact; Numerical modelling","Analytical models; Ballistics; Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Analytical modeling; Analytical studies; Ballistic Limit; Composite sandwich structure; Damaged area; Face skins; Front face; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); High-velocity impact; Rear face; Foams","Sun, Guangyong, Mechanical properties of hybrid composites reinforced by carbon and basalt fibers, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 148, pp. 636-651, (2018); Dhari, Rahul Singh, Progressive damage modeling and optimization of fibrous composites under ballistic impact loading, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 28, 12, pp. 1227-1244, (2021); Maimí, Pere, A continuum damage model for composite laminates: Part II - Computational implementation and validation, Mechanics of Materials, 39, 10, pp. 909-919, (2007); Hajikazemi, Mohammad, A variational model for free-edge interlaminar stress analysis in general symmetric and thin-ply composite laminates, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 443-451, (2018); Hu, F.

To enhance the impact resistance and improve the capacity of energy absorption of auxetic structures, foam-filled hybrid-chiral honeycomb beams (FHCB) were designed and fabricated through SLM (Selective laser melting) printing method and foaming method. The localized impulse loading was generated through the impact from foam projectile, accelerated by light gas gun. The dynamic responses of EHCB (empty hybrid-chiral honeycomb beam) and FHCB were compared. In the experimental results, FHCB showed enhanced impact resistance and higher SEA (specific energy absorption) value than EHCB. A validate finite element model was used to study the influence of cell-wall thickness on the impact resistance of EHCB and FHCB. Results indicated that by changing the cell-wall thickness, the potential energy absorption capacity of the filled foam can be fully utilized. Furthermore, the impact resistance of FHCB can be effectively improved by using a gradient cell-wall thickness arrangement.

In the second stage, an impact was made on the vertical stabilizer leading edge made of composite sandwich material. The deformation in the Z-direction occurring in the vertical stabilizer leading edge’s center and the ribs’ convergence were compared. The Ls-Dyna results show reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental result.

Thus, the performance of a sandwich structure used for enhancing the protection of a target structure is numerically investigated because it may experience such complex loading conditions resulting from combined blast and fragment impact. A conventional sandwich structure modelled using aluminium alloy resists a bare blast load imposed on it. Analysis, however, reveals that fragments penetrate through the front facesheet of a conventional sandwich structure, indicating a lower resistance of the front facesheet to combined blast and fragment effects. Thus, the behaviour of conventional aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures is compared with enhanced sandwich configurations consisting of a front facesheet covered with multilayer lightweight composite Kevlar fabric material. The Kevlar fabric arrests the maximum number of fragments, and reduces their momentum, thereby reducing the damage level in the sandwich structure. The effect of the charge weight and shape of the fragments on the damage modes of the sandwich structure is also assessed. With the increase in charge weight, the momentum of the fragments is found to increase, and these penetrate the back facesheet of the sandwich structure. © 2023 ICE Publishing.

Nevertheless, there is no direct comparison between those alternatives to evaluate their contribution to maximizing energy absorption. In this research, three core designs honeycomb, mushroom, and tubular were compared to determine the influence of core shape on the panel’s impact resistance against blast load. In addition to varying core shapes, the effect of plate thickness and the spacing between the core shapes are also examined. Finite element analysis was used to evaluate the performance of these designs. Twenty-seven numerical experiments were performed and then analyzed using regression analysis. Results reveal that the tubular sandwich panel exhibited minimum deformation, and least damage and contributed to the highest kinetic energy dissipation. On the other hand, honeycomb core structures recorded the highest internal energy dissipation, largest deformation, and damage. Despite those differences, core shape and core spacing were not as influential in resisting blast load compared to plate thickness. Facade plate thickness was the most significant factor. Results suggest that more research needs to be targeted toward enhancing façade plate stiffness for better mitigation of blast load. © 2023 by the authors.","blast mitigation; core structure; impact resistance; numerical analysis; sandwich panels","","Hoa, Tran Ngoc, Efficient Artificial neural networks based on a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm for damage detection in laminated composite structures, Composite Structures, 262, (2021); Chi, Y., The influence of core height and face plate thickness on the response of honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to blast loading, Materials and Design, 31, 4, pp. 1887-1899, (2010); Alberdi, Ryan, Performance evaluation of sandwich panel systems for blast mitigation, Engineering Structures, 56, pp. 2119-2130, (2013); Zonghong, Xie, On residual compressive strength prediction of composite sandwich panels after low-velocity impact damage, Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, 19, 1, pp. 9-17, (2006); Feng, Dianshi, Damage prediction in composite sandwich panels subjected to low-velocity impact, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 52, pp. 12-22, (2013); Schubel, Patrick M., Impact and post impact behavior of composite sandwich panels, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 38, 3, pp. 1051-1057, (2007); Rizov, Victor Iliev, Indentation study of foam core sandwich composite panels, Composite Structures, 69, 1, pp. 95-102, (2005); Tariq, Fawad, Residual compressive strength of aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich panel in the presence of multiple impact dents, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 2, pp. 1189-1205, (2022); Zhou, Xiang, Impact Damage Characteristics of Quartz Fiber and NOMEX Paper Honeycomb Sandwich Panel composite materials, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 2194, 1, (2022); Hua, Yi, Experimental and numerical investigation of carbon fiber sandwich panels subjected to blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 56, pp. 456-463, (2014)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

The cell magnification equivalent is the main method to solve those problems. This study finds that honeycomb structures with the same thickness-to-length ratios have the same mechanical properties and energy absorption characteristics. The improved equivalent finite element models of honeycomb structures with the same thickness-to-length ratios were established and validated by experiments. Based on the validated finite element model of the equivalent honeycomb structures, the out-of-plane compression behaviors of honeycomb structures were analyzed by LS-DYNA software. The results show that the performance of honeycomb structures is not equivalent before and after cell magnification. Thus, the cell magnification results were further subjected to CORA (correlation analysis) to determine the magnification time and prove the accuracy of the cell magnification time through drop-weight impact tests. In addition, a first-order decay exponential function (ExpDec1) for predicting cell magnification time was obtained by analyzing the relationship between the cell wall length and the cell magnification time. © 2023 by the authors.","aluminum honeycomb; cell magnification equivalent method; dynamic compression; mechanical behavior; prediction function","aluminum; cell; compression; mechanical property; prediction; simulation","Slimane, Sid Ahmed, Effect of position of tension-loaded inserts on honeycomb panels used for space applications, International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing, 12, 2, pp. 393-408, (2018); Liu, Yuanjie, Testing and modeling tearing and air effect of aluminum honeycomb under out-of-plane impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 135, (2020); Gong, Xiaobo, Impact Response of the Honeycomb Sandwich Structure with Different Poisson’s Ratios, Materials, 15, 19, (2022); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Bai, Zhonghao, A study on the mean crushing strength of hexagonal multi-cell thin-walled structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 80, pp. 38-45, (2014); Wang, Zhonggang, Theoretical and numerical analysis of the folding mechanism of vertex-based hierarchical honeycomb structure, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 27, 10, pp. 789-799, (2020); Hassanpour Roudbeneh, Fatemeh, Experimental investigation of quasistatic penetration tests on honeycomb sandwich panels filled with polymer foam, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 27, 21, pp. 1803-1815, (2020); Yamashita, Minoru, Impact behavior of honeycomb structures with various cell specifications - Numerical simulation and experiment, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 618-630, (2005); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Mukhopadhyay, T., Equivalent in-plane elastic properties of irregular honeycombs: An analytical approach, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 91, pp. 169-184, (2016)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The aim of this work is to modify an auxetic (re-entrant) honeycomb cell to reduce the stress concentrations within the cell structure, and further enhancement of this design. The auxetic structure was filled to achieve a greater energy absorbance and enhance safety applications. Analytical and elastic three-dimensional finite element approaches were used to investigate the structural strength performance. The basic model (i.e. modified re-entrant strut cell design) consisted of the honeycomb auxetic polypropylene (PP) structure sandwiched between two steel plates (known as safety panels) which were placed under static compression loading. The cell geometry and size were then modified to reduce the stress concentration zones. The structure cells were filled with silly putty and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam. The effect of the filling the cells on the stress concentration and energy absorbance were analysed using elastic stress and deformation analysis methods. During the stress path analysis, it was found that an increase in Young’s modulus of the filling was directly proportional to a decrease in internal stresses. It was concluded that while filling the basic model with soft materials reduced the stress concentration, but it led to a reduction in the energy absorbance capability. Further on, the lower stress produced by the enhanced could be useful to prevent significant penetration of the protective panel. Compared to similar structures of steel, auxetic foam panels have the advantage of having only a fraction of the weight and being corrosion resistant at the same time as keeping impact strength.

Special structural reinforcement and improvement, such as a crash absorber, are attached to prevent damage due to the impact load. Therefore, this article focuses on the crushing behaviour of the tsunami lifeboat crash absorber made of the multi-cell glass fibre-reinforced composite panel. The effect of the cross-section geometry design of the cell on the damage mechanism and energy absorption behaviour was investigated. The explicit dynamic finite element method was used to identify the multi-cell configuration's crashworthiness performance. Experimental studies such as tensile and three-point bending tests were conducted to define the material properties and validation of the FE model. The simulation results showed that the explicit dynamic finite element method has effectively estimated the crash absorber crushing damage. The circular cross-section has shown the most significant crash absorption capability compared to the others, namely the honeycomb, the square, and the triangular cell. Furthermore, the 4CSM laminate type has revealed a lower energy absorption than the 4WRC45 and 4WRC laminates. Otherwise, the study exhibits that the cross-sectional geometry and the laminate type significantly influence the crash absorber performance for improving the tsunami lifeboat crashworthiness. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.","crash absorber; crushing characteristics; energy absorption behaviour; multi-cell panel; tsunami lifeboat","Bending tests; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Cytology; Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Glass fibers; Tsunamis; Absorption behaviors; Composite panels; Crash absorber; Crushing characteristic; Energy absorption behavior; Explicit dynamic finite element method; Glass-fibre reinforced composites; Multi-cell panel; Multicell; Tsunami lifeboat; Lifeboats","Mamalis, Athanasios G., Crashworthy capability of composite material structures, Composite Structures, 37, 2, pp. 109-134, (1997); A Review of Crashworthiness of Composite Aircraft Structures, (1990); Fontana, Marco, Optimization of a thin-walled composite crash absorber, Thin-Walled Structures, 155, (2020); Lee, S.

To this end, this paper proposes a honeycomb-filled gradient energy-absorbing structure (HGES) as an energy absorber. The crashworthiness of HGES under axial crushing was investigated by means of finite element (FE) simulations and quasi-static loading tests. After performing parametric analyses on HGES, it was discovered that the wall thickness and the platform intensity of honeycomb had an evident impact, whereas the diaphragm thickness had a relatively little impact on the crashworthiness of HGES. The HGES is then given a multi-objective optimization to further enhance its crashworthiness. The wall thickness, the platform intensity of honeycomb and diaphragm thickness were utilized as the design parameters, while minimal peak crushing force (PCF) and maximal specific energy absorption (SEA) were set as optimization objectives. Finally, a methodology integrating entropy and the order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to find the optimal HGES configuration. The SEA and PCF of optimized HGES are enhanced by 19.81 and 25.28%, respectively, when compared to the baseline © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Sandwich panels with MPIC structure were modeled and finite element analysis was performed using commercially available software LS-DYNA to evaluate their specific energy absorption (SEA) and load-bearing capabilities. A cylindrical indenter (diameter = 10 mm and height = 15 mm) with material property of mild Steel (ρ = 7800 kg/m3) was impacted at three different velocities, i.e., 10 m/s (0.46 J), 50 m/s (11.49 J), 100 m/s (45.95 J) under predefined impact conditions. The obtained results were compared with that of a monolithic solid plate under identical loading conditions and geometrical dimensions. The proposed MPIC design was 93% lighter in weight than the monolithic solid plate. On comparison of stress contours, the monolithic solid plate exhibited regions of high-stress concentration at the impact zone. However, for the MPIC sandwich panel, the stress contour was found to be uniform. For an impact velocity of 100 m/s, the SEA of the MPIC sandwich panel was found to be 1142.6 J/kg, while for the monolithic solid plate, it was obtained as 57.17 J/kg. Eventhough complete penetration of the MPIC sandwich panel occurred for an impact velocity of 100 m/s, the SEA of the MPIC sandwich panels were found to be significantly higher than that of the monolithic solid plate. Since MPIC sandwich panels exhibit enhanced energy dissipation characteristics, they can be an alternative to the conventional monolithic solid plate as light-weight high performance designs for specific applications. © 2023","FEA; HVI; LVI; Miura Origami Pattern; Sandwich structures; SEA","Energy dissipation; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); High-velocity impact; HVI; Low-to-high; LVI; Miurum origami pattern; Monolithics; Sandwich panel; Solid plates; Specific energy absorption; Stress contours; Sandwich structures","Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); undefined, (2017); Xiang, Xinmei, Energy absorption of origami inspired structures and materials, Thin-Walled Structures, 157, (2020); Qi, Jiaqi, Energy absorption characteristics of origami-inspired honeycomb sandwich structures under low-velocity impact loading, Materials and Design, 207, (2021); Xiang, Xinmei, Rectangular sandwich plates with Miura-ori folded core under quasi-static loadings, Composite Structures, 195, pp. 359-374, (2018); Gatt, Ruben, Hierarchical Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Turner, Nicholas, A review of origami applications in mechanical engineering, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science, 230, 14, pp. 2345-2362, (2016); Fonseca, Larissa M., An overview of the mechanical description of origami-inspired systems and structures, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 223, (2022); undefined; Lv, Yang, On the out-of-plane compression of a Miura-ori patterned sheet, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 161-162, (2019)",""

The dynamic response of BCSP under impact load is simulated and analyzed by ABAQUS/Explicit software and compared with that of the composite sandwich panel (CSP) with a single foam core. The impact behavior of BCSP affected by these parameters, i.e., a different face sheet thickness, rubber core thickness and foam core height, was also reported. The results show that BCSP has superior impact resistance compared to CSP, with a lower damage area and smaller deformation, while carrying a higher impact load. Concurrently, BCSP is not highly restricted to any particular region when dealing with stress distributions. Compared to CSP, the bottom skin maximum stress value of BCSP is significantly reduced by 2.4–6.3 times at all considered impact energy levels. It is also found that the impact efficiency index of BCSP is 4.86 times higher than that of CSP under the same impact energy, indicating that the former can resist the impact load more effectively than the latter in terms of overall performance. Furthermore, the impact resistance of the BCSP improved with the increase in face sheet thickness and rubber core thickness. Additionally, the height of the foam core has a notable effect on the energy absorption, while it does not play a significant role in impact load. From an economic viewpoint, the height of the foam core retrofitted with 20 mm is reasonable. The results acquired from the current investigation can provide certain theoretical reference to the use of the bio-inspired composite sandwich panel in the engineering protection field. © 2023 by the authors.","bio-inspired composite sandwich panel; dual-core; finite element analysis; FML; impact resistance; low-velocity impact","ABAQUS; Biomimetics; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Laminated composites; Rubber; Sandwich structures; Bio-inspired composite sandwich panel; Composite sandwich panels; Dual-core; Face sheets; Fibre Metal Laminates; Finite element analyse; Foam core; Impact loads; Low velocity impact; Sheet thickness; Finite element method","Zhao, Ying, Mechanical properties and energy absorption capabilities of aluminium foam sandwich structure subjected to low-velocity impact, Construction and Building Materials, 273, (2021); Slimane, Sid Ahmed, Hypervelocity impact on honeycomb structure reinforced with bi-layer ceramic/aluminum facesheets used for spacecraft shielding, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 25, pp. 4487-4505, (2022); Sun, Guangyong, Lightweight hybrid materials and structures for energy absorption: A state-of-the-art review and outlook, Thin-Walled Structures, 172, (2022); Sun, Guangyong, On the structural parameters of honeycomb-core sandwich panels against low-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 216, (2021); Wang, Huihui, Low velocity impact penetration response of foam core sandwich panels with face sheets, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 173, (2023); Pang, Yuezhao, Dynamic response of polyurethane foam and fiber orthogonal corrugated sandwich structure subjected to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 282, (2022); Zniker, Houcine, Energy absorption and damage characterization of GFRP laminated and PVC-foam sandwich composites under repeated impacts with reduced energies and quasi-static indentation, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 16, (2022); Gao, Qiang, On the low-velocity impact responses of auxetic double arrowed honeycomb, Aerospace Science and Technology, 98, (2020); Xu, Yading, Tunable mechanical behavior of auxetic cementitious cellular composites (CCCs): Experiments and simulations, Construction and Building Materials, 266, (2021); Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The influence of wall thickness gradient form on the impact resistance of composite reentrant honeycomb structure was analyzed. The results showed that the wall thickness gradient setting of the reentrant honeycomb structure could reduce the maximum transverse deformation of the rear panel, and improve the anti-impact ability of the structure compared with homogeneous reentrant honeycomb structure.

Herein, analytical models were proposed to investigate the failure mechanisms of fluted-core sandwich composite panels, including global buckling, local buckling, and material failure. Failure mode maps of fluted-core sandwich panels were constructed to analyze the intrinsic impact mechanism of geometric parameters on failure behavior. Integrated fluted-core sandwich composite panels were then fabricated by adopting the integrated forming process and co-cured method. Uniaxial compression tests and finite element simulation were also conducted to verify the analytical predictions with good consistency. The effects of the geometric variable on both load-bearing capacity and failure modes of the structures were explored. The results indicated the occurrence of global buckling at small distances between the top and bottom face sheets, resulting in undesired load-carrying capacities. The decrease in width of short span or increase in thickness of face sheets prevented such local-buckling behavior, resulting in material failure. The triangular-shaped core with zero short spans was identified as a better option for material failure as dominant failure mode for designing load-bearing sandwich panels. These findings look promising for lightweight and load-carrying applications, providing a reliable reference for the initial design of such sandwich structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical modeling; Failure mode; Finite element method; Sandwich composite panel; Uniaxial compression test","Analytical models; Bearings (machine parts); Buckling; Compression testing; Failure modes; Honeycomb structures; Loads (forces); Sandwich structures; Structural design; Analytical modeling; Face sheets; Failure mechanism; Global buckling; Local buckling; Material failures; Sandwich composite panels; Sandwich panel; Uni-axial compression; Uni-axial compression tests; Finite element method","Song, Shijun, Compression, bending, energy absorption properties, and failure modes of composite Kagome honeycomb sandwich structure reinforced by PMI foams, Composite Structures, 277, (2021); Sugiyama, Kentaro, 3D printing of composite sandwich structures using continuous carbon fiber and fiber tension, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 113, pp. 114-121, (2018); Du, Yuntong, Fabrication and mechanical behaviors of carbon fiber reinforced composite foldcore based on curved-crease origami, Composites Science and Technology, 174, pp. 94-105, (2019); Xiong, Jian, Fabrication and mechanical behavior of carbon fiber composite sandwich cylindrical shells with corrugated cores, Composite Structures, 156, pp. 307-319, (2016); Kazemahvazi, Sohrab, Corrugated all-composite sandwich structures.

The finite element models for ABAQUS/Explicit are validated against the experimental results obtained from the quasi-static tests on the additively manufactured translational-sinusoid honeycomb (TSH) and symmetrical-sinusoid honeycomb (SSH). Quantitatively, the effect of impact velocity and relative density on the deformation mode is revealed by summarizing the deformation maps of SSH and TSH. It implies that the critical velocities at which the transformation of deformation mode happens are larger for SSH than those for TSH. Cells of TSH prefer to be tightly stacked together due to the chirality-liked configuration, whereas the symmetrical configuration strengthens the buckling resistance of SSH cells and the provisional and full densification states would sequentially experience in the crushing process. Investigation on the crushing performance further revealed that the crushing strength and the energy absorption capacity of SSH are slightly higher than those of TSH. In contrast, the densification strain of TSH is larger than that of SSH for a wide range of impact velocity. Regarding the deformation mechanism of representative units, theoretical models are proposed to evaluate the crushing strength of the sinusoid-curved honeycombs. Good agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical results is obtained under both quasi-static and dynamic loadings. Moreover, the effect of the cell topology on the mechanical performance of sinusoidal-curved honeycomb is discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crashworthiness; crushing strength; deformation mode; finite element analysis; sinusoid-curved honeycomb","ABAQUS; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Honeycomb structures; Numerical methods; Deformation modes; Finite element analyse; Finite element modelling (FEM); Impact velocities; Quasi-dynamics; Quasi-static loading; Quasi-static tests; Sinusoid-curved honeycomb; Static and dynamic loading; Theoretical methods; Finite element method","Hajjari, Mahdi, Lightweight weft-knitted tubular lattice composite for energy absorption applications: An experimental and numerical study, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 213, pp. 77-92, (2021); Tee, Yunlu, From nature to additive manufacturing: Biomimicry of porcupine quill, Materials and Design, 210, (2021); Wang, Shilong, Evaluation of in-plane crushing performance of printed randomly polymeric honeycombs filled with foamed concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 310, (2021); Crupi, Vincenzo, Comparison of aluminium sandwiches for lightweight ship structures: Honeycomb vs. foam, Marine Structures, 30, pp. 74-96, (2013); Li, Meng, Crashworthiness design optimisation of metal honeycomb energy absorber used in lunar lander, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 16, 4, pp. 411-419, (2011); Qin, Qinghua, Structural impact damage of metal honeycomb sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 252, (2020); Qiao, Pizhong, Impact mechanics and high-energy absorbing materials: Review, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 21, 4, pp. 235-248, (2008); Zhang, Yu, Dynamic mechanical behaviour and energy absorption of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under repeated impact loads, Ocean Engineering, 219, (2021); Ajdari, Amin, Dynamic crushing and energy absorption of regular, irregular and functionally graded cellular structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 3-4, pp. 506-516, (2011); Mousanezhad, Davood, Impact resistance and energy absorption of regular and functionally graded hexagonal honeycombs with cell wall material strain hardening, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 89, pp. 413-422, (2014)",""

However, it is susceptible to localized low-velocity impacts such as tool drop during maintenance, and thus, understanding the damage behavior is important for a safety design and optimization. The objective of this article is to investigate the influence of the structural parameters and impact energy on the damage behaviors of the composite honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to localized low-velocity impact. An effective computational framework considering complicate damage mechanisms is proposed to predict the failure patterns, load history, and energy absorption. Comparisons with the experimental data show that the error of predictions is within 4% and thus the framework is validated. Then, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of wall thickness and height of honeycomb, impact energy, and stacking sequences of the laminated facesheets on the impact resistance, damage behaviors, and energy absorption of the sandwich structure.

The low-velocity impact test was carried out on the tube-reinforced structure experimentally and numerically to evaluate its low-velocity impact response. It indicated that the stiffness, first linear stage slopes, and impact resistance of the honeycomb sandwich structure were increased by tube filling. Besides, the stress and deformation distribution of front and back panels were changed into more scattered and uniform, resulting in the reduction of maximum deflection. The maximum deflection of the front panel could be effectively reduced by filling the upper honeycomb core with aluminum tubes. Filling the lower honeycomb core with aluminum tubes could greatly reduce the maximum deflection of the middle and rear panels.

The impact dynamic response of sandwich panel with two kinds of in-plane and out-of-plane with sinusoidal honeycomb structure with the same relative density and different amplitudes at different impact speeds was studied based on ANSYS finite-element software. At different speeds, the sandwich panel impact process is divided into three stages, (a) partial perforation, (b) impact limit, and (c) full perforation. In the stages (a) and (b), the sinusoidal honeycomb is superior to the conventional honeycomb sandwich panel. When reaching the stage (c), the impact reaches the limit, the amplitude increases but the energy decreases, and the energy is almost unchanged when the speed is changed. The results show that the impact resistance of the sinusoidal honeycomb structure is directly related to its amplitude and impact velocity, compared with the conventional quadrangular honeycomb structure, the negative Poisson’s ratio effect of the sinusoidal honeycomb structure can improve the energy absorption capacity of the panel and have better impact resistance, which provides a reference for the design of improving the impact resistance of the structure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic impact; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Negative Poisson’s ratio; Sinusoidal curve","Sandwich structures; Dynamic impacts; Energy; High-low; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Negative poisson’s ratio; S ratio; Sandwich panel; Sinusoidal curve; Sinusoidal honeycomb cores; Honeycomb structures","Gupta, Nikhil, A functionally graded syntactic foam material for high energy absorption under compression, Materials Letters, 61, 4-5, pp. 979-982, (2007); Brandel, B., Negative Poisson's ratio polyethylene foams, Journal of Materials Science, 36, 24, pp. 5885-5893, (2001); Johnson, William, METALLIC ENERGY DISSIPATING SYSTEMS., Applied Mechanics Reviews, 31, 3, pp. 277-288, (1978); Yahaya, Mohd Azman, Response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to foam projectile impact - An experimental study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 100-109, (2015); Bouaziz, Olivier, Compression of crumpled aluminum thin foils and comparison with other cellular materials, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 570, pp. 1-7, (2013); Jin, Xiaochao, Dynamic response of sandwich structures with graded auxetic honeycomb cores under blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 106, pp. 206-217, (2016); Evans, Ken E., The design of doubly curved sandwich panels with honeycomb cores, Composite Structures, 17, 2, pp. 95-111, (1991); Yang, Wei, On auxetic materials, Journal of Materials Science, 39, 10, pp. 3269-3279, (2004); Grima, Joseph N., On the properties of auxetic meta-tetrachiral structures, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 245, 3, pp. 511-520, (2008); Grima, Joseph N., On the potential of connected stars as auxetic systems, Molecular Simulation, 31, 13, pp. 925-935, (2005)",""

Based on the experimental data in the existing literatures, the parameters of the H/V-JC/CS constitutive model for metal materials are calibrated by using the global optimization algorithm, which has high accuracy, convenient application, and is unlimited in number of parameters. The obtained parameters do not depend on the initial value and are the global optimal combination. The corresponding ABAQUS visual user material subroutine is compiled and imported into the finite element analysis for the dynamic response of the honeycomb panel structure. The influence of geometric parameters on the energy absorption effect of honeycomb panels under impact load is explored. The research shows that the proposed H/V-JC/CS constitutive model can well describe the mechanical behavior of various metals in a wide range of strain rates under impact load, and can be used in ABAQUS dynamic explicit environment.

To improve the crashworthiness of the SSH, a self-similar concentric star honeycomb (SCSH) is proposed. The finite element model of the SSH is established to compare with the existing reference results. The dynamic impact behavior of the SCSH at three different impact velocities is studied. The results show that the SCSH has higher plateau stress and energy absorption than the SSH at different velocities, especially at low-velocity and medium-velocity. In addition, the effects of wall thickness, cell wall angle, and the number of concentric walls on energy absorption are studied. It can be seen from the parameter analysis that wall thickness and the number of concentric walls have a greater influence on crashworthiness. To better simulate the actual collision scene, the crashworthiness of the SCSH under oblique loading is studied, and it is found that the SCSH still had better energy absorption than the SSH.

By deforming two cell walls of a triangular honeycomb (TH) inward to various degrees, novel re-entrant triangular honeycombs (RTs) were designed. Two novel RT structures were considered—a regular RT (RRT) and a staggered RT (SRT)—to conduct a systematic investigation. The in-plane dynamic crushing behavior was studied though the nonlinear finite element method. The results show that the RTs had rich deformation modes under different impact velocities, in which the RRT exhibited a double-plateau stage and the SRT possessed a large negative Poisson's ratio. Subsequently, the deformation mechanisms of the RTs were explained and the theoretical formula of RRT was deduced according to the energy conservation under low-velocity impact. As the same relative density, the RT exhibited a higher energy-absorbing capacity and crashworthiness for mid-velocity crushing, and this trend was amplified by the impact velocity. Finally, the apical angle and temperature had significant effects on the RT and TH.

To explore the in-plane mechanical properties and energy absorption performance of bio-honeycombs under different impact speeds, finite element (FE) models are established and verified by empirical formulas and current experiments. The results indicate that the bio-honeycombs outperform the Hex in terms of energy absorption capacity, and the nominal stress–strain curves of the bio-honeycombs show two prominent stages (stage Ⅰ and stage Ⅱ) under quasi-static and mid-impact. Bionic units also undergo two evident deformation stages: preliminary collapse and further crushing. The bending and traction of bionic units make more adjacent cells added to the collapse earlier, forming a global crushed trend, leading to an interesting phenomenon that the localized band of bio-honeycombs are always wider than that of Hex. Also, negative Poisson's ratio is observed in stage Ⅱ from several bio-honeycombs under quasi-static and mid-speed due to bionic units' bending and traction in the further crushing stage. Besides, the number and distribution of ribs have a considerable impact on the crashworthiness of bio-honeycombs. Compared with the Hex, the incorporated bionic units reduce the peak crushing force (PCF) while improving the crashworthiness of bio-honeycomb in the case of the same relative density, which provides a promising potential solution to strengthen the energy absorption performance of honeycomb structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Beetle elytra intersection unit; Bionic design; Energy absorption; Finite element analysis; Honeycomb structures","Bending (forming); Biomechanics; Bionics; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Absorption performance; Beetle elytrum intersection unit; Bionic design; Finite element analyse; Finite element modelling (FEM); Hexagonal honeycomb; Impact speed; In-plane mechanical properties; Mechanical energies; Quasi-static; Finite element method","Fang, Jianguang, On design optimization for structural crashworthiness and its state of the art, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 55, 3, pp. 1091-1119, (2017); Structure and Properties, (1988); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); Balawi, Shadi O.M., A refined model for the effective in-plane elastic moduli of hexagonal honeycombs, Composite Structures, 84, 2, pp. 147-158, (2008); Ivañez, Inés, Numerical modelling of the low-velocity impact response of composite sandwich beams with honeycomb core, Composite Structures, 106, pp. 716-723, (2013); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing strength of hexagonal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 467-474, (2010); Cricrì, Gabriele, Honeycomb failure processes under in-plane loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 45, 1, pp. 1079-1090, (2013); Khan, Muhammad Kashif, Experimental investigation of in-plane and out-of-plane crushing of aluminum honeycomb, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 539, pp. 135-142, (2012); Wang, Zhonggang, Deformation mode evolutional mechanism of honeycomb structure when undergoing a shallow inclined load, Composite Structures, 147, pp. 211-219, (2016); Tankasala, Harika C., The in-plane elastic-plastic response of an incompressible, filled hexagonal honeycomb, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 155, (2021)",""

It is of great significance for the safety to study the failure mechanism of composite sandwich structures under the ballistic impact and improve the structural impact resistance. However, the previous researches mainly focus on the performance of the hybrid sandwich structures with foam cores or metal grid cores. The main novelty of this study is to investigate the ballistic impact resistance of a composite composite sandwich panel with the fiber reinforced X-frame cores by using the projectile impact tests and numerical simulations. The impact resistance of this integrally molded fiber reinforced cores is less reported and is expected to be superior than that of the common aluminum, polymer and foam cores. For comparison, the carbon fiber composite cross-ply laminates with the identical areal density and the foam reinforced sandwich panels with the X-frame are tested. The experimental results indicate that the ballistic limit of the X-frame sandwich panel is similar to that of its equivalent laminate under the normal projectile penetration. Filling foams increase the structural ballistic limit velocity and energy absorbing amount by 18.2% and 33.9%, respectively. The widest range of fiber breakage and delamination on the sandwich panel observed appear at impact velocities approaching the ballistic limit, while the local damage is found under the high-speed perforation. The numerical results indicate that the projectile kinetic energy dissipated by the X-frame core accounts for over 50% of the total under the normal impact and the core has the better specific energy absorption capacity than the skins. The impact oblique angle and impact position are found to have a significant effect on the impact resistance of the X-frame sandwich panel through the numerical calculations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Ballistic impact tests; Composite sandwich panel; Energy absorption; Finite element analysis (FEA); Perforation resistance","Carbon fibers; Failure (mechanical); Foams; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Laminated composites; Projectiles; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Ballistic impact; Ballistic impact tests; Composite sandwich panels; Composite sandwich structure; Finite element analyse; Foam core; Perforation resistance; Performance; Sandwich panel; Energy absorption","Wang, Ben, Double-layer woven lattice truss sandwich composite for multifunctional application: Design, manufacture and characterization, Composites Part B: Engineering, 241, (2022); Zhang, Runbo, Design and characterization of the carbon fiber tube reinforced polymer composite for full ocean depth submersibles, Composites Science and Technology, 217, (2022); Xiong, Jian, Sandwich Structures with Prismatic and Foam Cores: A Review, Advanced Engineering Materials, 21, 1, (2019); Fleck, Norman A., Micro-architectured materials: Past, present and future, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 466, 2121, pp. 2495-2516, (2010); Wu, Qianqian, Failure of carbon fiber composite sandwich cylinders with a lattice core under axial compressive loading, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 155, (2022); Yang, Haiyang, Load-bearing capacity and failure mechanism of integrated fluted-core composite sandwich cylinders, Composites Science and Technology, 221, (2022); Abdullah, N.

In this work, a new concave I-shaped honeycomb structure is established by integrating the re-entrant hexagon and the I-shaped beam structure, and its negative Poisson’s ratio characteristics and energy absorption properties are investigated. The effect of structural parameters on the energy absorption characteristics is analyzed using the finite element model. The results show that both the specific energy absorption and peak impact force decrease with the increase in cellular length and vertical short cellular height, and increase with the increase in horizontal short cellular length and cellular thickness. To obtain a smaller peak impact force and larger specific energy absorption with smaller mass, the four cell sizes were optimized by using Latin hypercube sampling, Gaussian radial basis function, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Compared with the original design, the SEA increased by 44.175%, and the PCF increased by 25.857%. Meanwhile, the mass decreased by 31.140%.

The face sheet and honeycomb core of the proposed all-composite sandwich structure in this work are composed of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. The mechanical response and damage mechanism of the all-composite sandwich structure under out-of-plane quasi-static compression and out-of-plane impact are studied by numerical methods. The refined finite element models of the sandwich structures are built on the ABAQUS/Explicit platform. The micromechanics of failure (MMF) theory based on physical component failure is used to describe the intralaminar damage mechanism of the face sheet and honeycomb core, and the mixed-mode exponential cohesive zone model (ECZM) is utilized to simulate the initiation and evolution of interlayer damage. In addition, the cohesive contact approach is adopted to capture the debonding failure at the face-sheet/core. The numerical results show that the all-composite sandwich structure has the characteristics of large structural stiffness and strong energy absorption ability. The failure mechanism of the all-composite sandwich structure under compression is mainly matrix damage and delamination of the honeycomb core, with buckling and folding in appearance. Under out-of-plane impact, matrix damage and delamination arise on the upper sheet, little damage is observed on the lower sheet, and the delamination damage morphology tends to be circular with increasing impact energy. In addition, the interface failure of the upper-sheet/core is more than that of the lower-sheet/core. In addition, the matrix damage near the impact center of the honeycomb core tends to be consistent with the delamination contour, and a small amount of fiber failure is also observed, which manifests as a collapse morphology of the impact area. The research results enrich the understanding of the mechanical behavior of all-composite sandwich structures with honeycomb cores and provide theoretical support for their potential applications. © 2022 by the authors.","all-composite; compression; failure; honeycomb; impact","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Mechanisms; Morphology; Numerical methods; Sandwich structures; All-composite; Composite sandwich structure; Compression; Face sheets; Failure mechanism; Honeycomb; Honeycomb core; Impact; matrix; Out-of-plane; ABAQUS","Sun, Zhi, Topological optimization of biomimetic sandwich structures with hybrid core and CFRP face sheets, Composites Science and Technology, 142, pp. 79-90, (2017); Nath, Shukantu Dev, Performance Evaluation of Sandwich Structures Printed by Vat Photopolymerization, Polymers, 14, 8, (2022); Al-Fatlawi, Alaa, Optimization of a totally fiber-reinforced plastic composite sandwich construction of helicopter floor for weight saving, fuel saving and higher safety, Polymers, 13, 16, (2021); Elangovan, Hariharan, Dynamic characterization of tapered composite sandwich plate with honeycomb core: Numerical and experimental investigations, Thin-Walled Structures, 178, (2022); Patel, Shivdayal D., The efficient design of hybrid and metallic sandwich structures under air blast loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 24, 3, pp. 1706-1725, (2022); Xue, Debo, Study on compression characteristics of honeycomb sandwich structure with multistage carbon fiber reinforced composites, Polymer Composites, 43, 9, pp. 6252-6264, (2022); Patekar, Vivek, State of the art review on mechanical properties of sandwich composite structures, Polymer Composites, 43, 9, pp. 5820-5830, (2022); Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical studies on indentation and perforation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 110-124, (2018); Güneş, Recep, Development of numerical realistic model for predicting low-velocity impact response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 18, 1, pp. 95-112, (2016); He, Wentao, Effect of structural parameters on low-velocity impact behavior of aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP face sheets, Thin-Walled Structures, 137, pp. 411-432, (2019)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

It also has dynamic mechanical characteristics such as a high impact resistance and high energy absorption. To explore the influence of the Poisson’s ratio on the local impact resistance, this paper compares and analyzes the local impact resistance of a series of honeycomb cores with different Poisson’s ratios under the impact of a spherical projectile at different speeds. Three typical honeycombs with negative/zero/positive Poisson ratios (re-entrant hexagon, semi-re-entrant hexagon, and hexagon) are selected to change the geometric parameters in order to have the same relative density and different Poisson ratios (−2.76–3.63). The relative magnitude of the rear face sheet displacement is in the order of negative Poisson’s ratio > zero Poisson’s ratio > positive Poisson’s ratio, which reveals that the honeycomb structure with the positive Poisson’s ratio has better protection ability than the others. Finally, a dual-wall hexagonal honeycomb is proposed. The rear face sheet displacement of the dual-wall hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structure is reduced by 34.4% at 25 m/s compared with the hexagonal honeycomb, which has a better local impact resistance. © 2022 by the authors.","dual-wall honeycomb; finite element; honeycomb sandwich structure; impact resistance; Poisson’s ratios","Energy absorption; Finite element method; Poisson ratio; Sandwich structures; Dual Wall; Dual-wall honeycomb; Face sheets; Finite element; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Local impacts; Poisson’s ratio; Rear face; S ratio; Honeycomb structures","Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Quanjin, Ma, A review of the recent trends on core structures and impact response of sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 55, 18, pp. 2513-2555, (2021); Feng, Yixiong, Creative design for sandwich structures: A review, International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 17, 3, (2020); Hexweb Honeycomb Attributes and Properties, (1999); Liu, Jiefu, Blast resistance and parametric study of sandwich structure consisting of honeycomb core filled with circular metallic tubes, Composites Part B: Engineering, 145, pp. 261-269, (2018); Alhijazi, Mohamad, Finite Element Analysis of Natural Fibers Composites: A Review, Nanotechnology Reviews, 9, 1, pp. 853-875, (2020); Liu, Jiefu, In-plane crushing behaviors of hexagonal honeycombs with different Poisson's ratio induced by topological diversity, Thin-Walled Structures, 159, (2021); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Huang, Jian, In-plane mechanics of a novel zero Poisson's ratio honeycomb core, Composites Part B: Engineering, 89, pp. 67-76, (2016); Scarpa, Fabrizio L., On the transverse shear modulus of negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structures, Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures, 23, 8, pp. 717-720, (2000)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Specifically, three types of auxetic cores including square node anti-tetra chiral, re-entrant, and arrowhead were investigated and compared with the conventional honeycomb in terms of energy absorption, compressive strength, and Young’s modulus. The specimens were fabricated using FDM 3D printing method and quasi-static compression and low velocity impact loading tests were performed on the printed specimens. Moreover, finite element simulations were conducted to compare with experimental results and deformation patterns as well as for parametric study. Results indicate that the core topology is a critical parameter impressing the mechanical properties of sandwich structures, and using the auxetic cores improved the desirable properties of sandwich structures in both types of loading.

The influences of these design parameters on failure mode and response behavior are quantified and discussed. Advanced finite element (FE) simulation is performed in LS-DYNA software to extract more information on the strains, stresses, and energy absorption of the panel during impact.

In this paper, we investigated an NPR mechanical metamaterial: star-circle honeycomb (SCH), which possesses enhanced stiffness compared to the classical star-shaped honeycomb (SH). Based on the Castigliano's second theorem and the principle of virtual work, a theoretical model was built to calculate the effective elastic properties of the SCH, and validated by the finite element method (FEM). The comparison with the SH showed that the SCH possessed a significantly enhanced elastic modulus. Also, we find that the elastic properties can be adjusted broadly and tailored to meet the engineering needs by selecting parameters reasonably. Subsequently, the anisotropic quasi-static compression responses of the SCH were studied. The results showed that the plateau stress and energy absorption capacity in the y-direction load were both better than that in the x-direction load.

The first one has Fiber-reinforced Geopolymer (FRG) composite skin layers and polyurethane (PUR) foam core, and the second one is based on the first panel but strengthened with Basalt fiber reinforced polymer sheet (BFRP). Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the structural behavior and vibration characteristics of these panels. The failure mechanisms and capacity of the developed lightweight sandwich panels under flexural and compressive loads are studied by experimental quasi-static tests. Experimental results from flexural and compressive loading tests match well those from analytical calculations. The experimental studies show that the lightweight sandwich panel has a competitive capacity for prefabricated buildings. The vibration characteristics of the developed lightweight sandwich panels are obtained by hammer impact vibration tests. The finite element models are developed to predict the vibration characteristics of the tested sandwich panels. The obtained natural frequencies and mode shapes from numerical analysis and experimental tests show that the developed finite element models can be used to predict the vibration characteristics of geopolymer composite lightweight sandwich panels accurately.

The finite element software ABAQUS was used to conduct numerical simulation research on the process of a standard 12.7-mm projectile penetrating sandwich composite armor. The armor-piercing projectile model was simplified as a rigid body. The numerical simulation models were applied to three different sandwich composite armor structures (A, B, and C), each with a total armor thickness of 25 mm. The penetration resistance of the three kinds of composite armor was studied. We obtained velocity curves for the rigid projectile penetrating the different structures. The failure forms and penetration resistance characteristics of the three composite armor structures adopted in this paper were analyzed. In addition, the velocity reduction ratio is proposed as an index to evaluate the penetration resistance performance of the armor. The simulation results revealed decreasing rates of projectile speed in the structures A, B, and C of 69.6%, 91.1%, and 100%, respectively. The third composite armor (structure C) designed here has excellent penetration resistance and can block the penetration of a high-speed (818m/s) rigid projectile.

A honeycomb cell was first designed by out-of-plane stretching a re-entrant honeycomb and the honeycomb is built by spatially combining the cells. The in-plane response and energy absorption characteristics of the honeycomb are studied through the finite element method (FEM). Some important characteristics are studied and listed as follows: (1) The effects of cell angle and impact velocity on the dynamic response are tested. The results show that the honeycomb exhibits an obvious negative Poisson’s ratio and unique platform stress enhancement effect under the conditions of low and medium velocity. An obvious necking phenomenon appears when the cell angle parameter is 75°. (2) Based on the one-dimensional shock wave theory, the empirical formula of the platform stress is proposed to predict the dynamic bearing capacity of the honeycomb. (3) The energy absorption in different conditions are investigated. Results show that as the impact velocity increases, the energy absorption efficiency gradually decreases. In addition, with the increase of cell angle, the energy absorption efficiency is gradually improved. The above study shows that the honeycomb has good potential in using in vehicle industry as an energy absorption material. It also provides a new strategy for multi-objective optimization of mechanical structure design. © 2022 by the authors.","deformation mode; energy absorption; impact response; negative Poisson’s ratio; platform stress","","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Özen, İsmail, Low-energy impact response of composite sandwich panels with thermoplastic honeycomb and reentrant cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 156, (2020); Hong, Jichao, A novel mechanical-electric-hydraulic power coupling electric vehicle considering different electrohydraulic distribution ratios, Energy Conversion and Management, 249, (2021); Qi, Chang, Multi-scale characterization of novel re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs under quasi-static crushing, Thin-Walled Structures, 169, (2021); Wang, Huan, A novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced in-plane impact resistance, Composite Structures, 208, pp. 758-770, (2019); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: the positive side of being negative, Engineering Science and Education Journal, 9, 4, pp. 148-154, (2000); Hong, Jichao, Thermal Runaway Prognosis of Battery Systems Using the Modified Multiscale Entropy in Real-World Electric Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 7, 4, pp. 2269-2278, (2021); Tan, Hailun, In-plane crashworthiness of re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio, Composite Structures, 229, (2019); Xiao, Dengbao, Compression behavior of the graded metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb: Experiment and finite element analysis, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 758, pp. 163-171, (2019); Djemaoune, Younes A., Numerical investigation into in-plane crushing of tube-reinforced damaged 5052 aerospace grade aluminum alloy honeycomb panels, Materials, 14, 17, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The designs are evaluated using a nonlinear finite element (FE) model validated by comparing the load, displacement and final shape of a representative sandwich panel against related experimental results. An extensive number of experiments characterise the mechanical performance of sandwich panels in pristine and perforated architected foams, the latter with perforations distributed following cubic and hexagon packing. A single lap joint test assesses the bonding between the aluminium skins and the epoxy adhesive system. Three-point bending and drop tower impact tests are performed to characterise the foams and the panels. Aluminium sheets are also tested for comparison purposes. Analysis of variance and Tukey test are used to compare the results from a statistical standpoint. The validity of the optimisation process is demonstrated through the design of sandwich panels made of hexagonal architectures of foam perforations and subjected to impact load. The sandwich panel is optimised to minimise mass and maximise the absorbed energy by using a custom routine integrated with a genetic algorithm. The results demonstrate that sandwich panels in pristine conditions provide enhanced bending performance, while panels with perforated foams have larger impact resistance.

The three-dimensional (3D) printing technology was adopted to manufacture stainless steel specimens with varying cell side length-to-thickness ratios and cell configurations. The specimens were crushed under three distinct energy inputs, and the deforming process and relevant mechanical parameters, e.g., the Poisson's ratio, failure mode, plateau stress and energy absorption capacity were studied. The FE results can generally compare well with the experimental ones and facilitate clarifying the impact mechanisms of the experimental results. Improvements of the auxetic specimens in energy absorption were verified through comparison with that of the corresponding convex honeycomb. The results reveal that the specimen with an auxetic honeycomb has higher plateau stress and specific energy absorption with less deformation when the geometric size is the same.

The finite element software ABAQUS/EXPLICIT is applied to investigate the relationship between crashworthiness and energy absorption performance with different impact velocities and geometric parameters. The simulation results show that DSH has better impact resistance and energy absorption than RHH. DSH has improved plateau stress by 141.3%, 78.7%, and 22.7% of low-velocity, medium-velocity, and high-velocity compression, respectively, and SEA by 103.7%, 79.3%, and 7.3%, respectively. In addition, the impact resistance of the four enhanced honeycombs is further improved. The shrinkage effect of DSH after impact is not as good as that of RHH, and the horizontal ribs suppress the negative Poisson's ratio property of the honeycomb. Different impact velocities affect the deformation pattern of the honeycomb. With the increase of impact velocities, the honeycomb has a transition from overall deformation to local deformation with increasing velocity. The plateau stress and specific energy absorption of the honeycomb are significantly influenced by the geometric parameters.

The indentation force during impact loading consists of two regimes, one for small indentations of the top face-sheet due to bending moments and the other for larger deformation due to membrane forces. Also, the crushable core is considered a rigid-plastic foundation, and the elastic aspect is neglected. To obtain a more accurate approximation of the static indentation of the beam, both the local and global deformation of the sandwich beam are considered. The minimum potential energy method is applied for the extraction of governing equations. Furthermore, by developing a three dimensional finite element model through the ABAQUS code, the low velocity impact on composite sandwich beams with foam core is simulated. The contact force history, maximum contact force, and upper face-sheet displacement results computed by the analytical model are compared with experimental and ABAQUS simulations.

Here we present the enhancement of the drop-weight impact resistance of composite sandwich beams with nanocomposite facesheets by taking advantage of auxetic 3D lattice cores with FG (functionally graded) configurations. 2D and 3D lattice metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs) were modeled, analyzed, and compared. Furthermore, the 3D lattice cores were designed to possess four FG patterns along the thickness direction. The mechanical properties of graphene reinforced composites (GRCs) were determined by means of micromechanical modeling according to the extended Halpin-Tsai model. In view of shape changes of lattices due to the localized deformation, full-scale finite element modeling is necessary, followed by nonlinear analysis. Compared with a re-entrant honeycomb core having the same relative density, the auxetic 3D lattice core can lead to even better resistance. Moreover, FG configurations are proven to have different effects on the impactor displacement and local transient thickness decrease of sandwich beams subjected to low-velocity impacts. Our results demonstrated the advantages of FG auxetic 3D lattices, and are expected to be beneficial to further studies and instructive for practical applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic 3D lattices; Drop-weight impact resistance; Functionally graded; GRCs; Metamaterials; Sandwich beams","Composite beams and girders; Drops; Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Nonlinear analysis; 3D lattices; Auxetic 3d lattice; Auxetics; Drop-weight impact resistance; Drop-weight impacts; Face sheets; Functionally graded; Graphene reinforced composite; Reinforced composites; Sandwich beams; Sandwich structures; composite; mechanical property; numerical model; Poisson ratio; structural component","Zhao, Xuan, Bending response and energy absorption of sandwich beams with novel auxetic honeycomb core, Engineering Structures, 247, (2021); undefined; Shen, Hui shen, Assessment of negative Poisson’s ratio effect on the postbuckling of pressure-loaded FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells, Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines, 51, 4, pp. 1856-1880, (2023); Fan, Yin, The effect of negative Poisson’s ratio on the low-velocity impact response of an auxetic nanocomposite laminate beam, International Journal of Mechanics and Materials in Design, 17, 1, pp. 153-169, (2021); Mir, Mariam, Review of mechanics and applications of auxetic structures, Advances in Materials Science and Engineering, 2014, (2014); Wang, Lu, Manufacture and behaviour of innovative 3D printed auxetic composite panels subjected to low-velocity impact load, Structures, 38, pp. 910-933, (2022); Hedayatian, Mohammad, The Efficiency of Auxetic Cores in Sandwich Beams Subjected to Low-Velocity Impact, International Journal of Applied Mechanics, 12, 6, (2020); Baertsch, Florian, Finite-Element Modeling and Optimization of 3D-Printed Auxetic Reentrant Structures with Stiffness Gradient under Low-Velocity Impact, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 147, 7, (2021); Hedayatian, Mohammad, An investigation of optimal auxetic cores in sandwich structures to withstand low-velocity impact loading, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 6, pp. 1830-1842, (2022); Bui, Tinh Quoc, Dynamic analysis of sandwich beams with functionally graded core using a truly meshfree radial point interpolation method, Engineering Structures, 47, pp. 90-104, (2013)",""

To further enhance the shock resistance, this study proposes lightweight sandwich beams with honeycomb-supported corrugated cores. Firstly, dynamic responses of fully-clamped sandwich beams with such honeycomb-corrugation hybrid cores, including deformation/failure modes and beam deflections, were experimentally measured under simulated shock loading via foam projectile impact, and were compared with those of corresponding corrugated sandwich beams without honeycomb insertions. Secondly, the finite elements (FE) method was used to simulate the shock experiment. FE simulation results were validated against experimental measurements, with good agreement achieved. Subsequently, the FE model was employed to explore further how impact velocity, relative density of honeycomb, and honeycomb orientation in hybrid core affect beam deflection, and to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms. It was demonstrated that combining honeycombs with folded plates (corrugations) to create a hybrid core for sandwich construction led to significant enhancement in shock resistance, especially at relatively low projectile momentum where more than 50% enhancement could be achieved. Such superiority of the hybrid-cored sandwich beam was mainly attributed to its high specific compressive/shear strength as a result of the beneficial interaction effect between honeycomb insertions and folded plates, thus enabling smaller core crushing/deformation and higher bending strength of the impulsively loaded sandwich beam. At sufficiently high impact momentum, however, the interaction effect vanished as deformation of the fully-clamped sandwich beam is now dominated by stretching rather than bending. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Enhancement mechanism; Foam projectile; Honeycomb-corrugation hybrid core; Sandwich beam; Shock resistance","Bending strength; Composite beams and girders; Compressive strength; Fluid structure interaction; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Beam deflection; Clamped sandwich beams; Corrugated core; Enhancement mechanism; Foam projectile; Fully clamped; Honeycomb-corrugation hybrid core; Hybrid cores; Sandwich beams; Shock resistance; Deformation","Fleck, Norman A., The resistance of clamped sandwich beams to shock loading, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 71, 3, pp. 386-401, (2004); Rathbun, Howard J., Performance of metallic honeycomb-core sandwich beams under shock loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 43, 6, pp. 1746-1763, (2006); Peng, Chenxi, Bioinspired functionally graded gyroid sandwich panel subjected to impulsive loadings, Composites Part B: Engineering, 188, (2020); Wang, Xin, Shock resistance of elastomer-strengthened metallic corrugated core sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 237, (2022); Zhang, Pan, Experimental study on the dynamic response of foam-filled corrugated core sandwich panels subjected to air blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 105, pp. 67-81, (2016); Cheng, Yuansheng, The effects of foam filling on the dynamic response of metallic corrugated core sandwich panel under air blast loading – Experimental investigations, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 145, pp. 378-388, (2018); Wang, Xin, Dynamic response of clamped sandwich beams with fluid-fillied corrugated cores, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 139, (2020); Yu, Runpei, Effects of sand filling on the dynamic response of corrugated core sandwich beams under foam projectile impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 197, (2020); Yan, Leilei, Compressive strength and energy absorption of sandwich panels with aluminum foam-filled corrugated cores, Composites Science and Technology, 86, pp. 142-148, (2013); Han, Bin, Honeycomb-corrugation hybrid as a novel sandwich core for significantly enhanced compressive performance, Materials and Design, 93, pp. 271-282, (2016)",""

Active debris removal, involving capture and deorbit of larger items, has been identified as important in controlling future debris population growth. One concept for capturing debris is a harpoon, with low post-penetration residual velocity being a key design requirement. Aluminium sandwich panels are common structural components on typical spacecraft and consequently a probable target structure. An ideal harpooning event is characterised with complete penetration of the sandwich panel and low harpoon residual (post penetration) velocity. This paper presents development of a numerical modelling tool for a harpoon design for active orbital debris removal. The ability to predict the ballistic limit of an aluminium sandwich panel with a honeycomb core representative of a large satellite structural element being the primary requirement for the modelling tool. The modelling approach was validated against the experimental results from normal and oblique impact tests performed for ogive and flat nose projectiles over a velocity range between 50 m/s to 120 m/s. The modelling was based on explicit finite element method, using the commercial LS-DYNA code. An element failure criterion was used to approximate material damage and failure. Sensitivity studies were performed to investigate the influence of model key features on the projectile exit velocity. The features with the strongest influence were the face sheet material model and the projectile-panel friction model. The projectile exist velocities observed in the experiments were used to select the final parameters used. The use of an element deletion criterion that incorporated the influence of stress triaxiality improved the agreement for the plate deformation behaviour between the numerical and experimental results. For the ogive nose projectile, the exit velocity agreed well with the experiments for the range of impact velocities and angles considered. For the flat nose projectile, the model overestimated the exit velocity. In the case of the normal impact this was due to the model's inability to capture the honeycomb crushing ahead of the projectile. © 2022","aluminium alloy; ballistic limit; explicit finite element; projectile impact; Sandwich panel","Earth (planet); Finite element method; Orbits; Population statistics; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Space debris; Velocity; Active spaces; Aluminium sandwich panel; Ballistic Limit; Design tool; Exit velocity; Explicit finite elements; Modeling designs; Modelling tools; Projectile impact; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","undefined, (2021); Liou, Jer Chyi, Controlling the growth of future LEO debris populations with active debris removal, Acta Astronautica, 66, 5-6, pp. 648-653, (2010); De Vuyst, Tom, The effect of the orientation of cubical projectiles on the ballistic limit and failure mode of AA2024-T351 sheets, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 104, pp. 21-37, (2017); Lin, Chunfu, Perforation of composite plates and sandwich panels under quasi-static and projectile loading, Journal of Composite Materials, 40, 20, pp. 1801-1840, (2006); Hou, Weihong, Ballistic impact experiments of metallic sandwich panels with aluminium foam core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 10, pp. 1045-1055, (2010); Yungwirth, Christian J., Experiment assessment of the ballistic response of composite pyramidal lattice truss structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 39, 3, pp. 556-569, (2008); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Perforation of honeycomb sandwich plates by projectiles, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 31, 8, pp. 889-899, (2000); Goldsmith, Werner, Perforation of cellular sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 19, 5-6, pp. 361-379, (1997); Kolopp, Amélie, Modeling impact on aluminium sandwich including velocity effects in honeycomb core, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 15, 6, pp. 733-757, (2013); Kolopp, Amélie, Experimental study of sandwich structures as armour against medium-velocity impacts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 61, pp. 24-35, (2013)","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Research on hypervelocity impact (HVI) led to the development of shield configurations such as the conventional Whipple shield, which consists of two plates separated by a stand-off distance to allow for the fragmentation and dispersion of the debris from the impact. Variations in the Whipple shield have been proposed, where additional layers are included for increased energy dissipation efficiency. In this work, the authors develop, validate and test a numerical model of an orthogonally loaded hybrid Whipple shield, incorporating an aluminium honeycomb core, orientated with hexagonal tubes perpendicular to the direction of proposed debris travel, to mitigate the well-known channelling effect. The debris threat is an A2024-T3 projectile, impacting the structure at a velocity of 6.5 km/s. The proposed model is validated with experimental observations of the debris spread at half-angle and the efficiency of the proposed topology is assessed against a conventional two-plate A2024-T3 shield. The honeycomb core cell density, its position relative to the point of impact, the thickness of the honeycomb shell, and the material of the honeycomb are thoroughly analysed. A hybrid honeycomb structure concept is proposed, which provides a highly efficient alternative to a standard Whipple shield design, without significantly compromising the weight of the structure. The obtained results clearly show that the hybrid Whipple shield exhibits significantly increased the kinetic energy dissipation of the debris from the impactor and shield front plate, with an increase in the dissipated kinetic energy that can reach (Formula presented.) relative to the conventional shield. © 2022 by the authors.","finite-element analysis; honeycomb passive shielding; hypervelocity impact; LSDyna; micro-meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD); Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH); whipple shield","","Handbook for Designing Mmod Protection, (2009); European Space Agencys Annual Space Environment Report, (2020); Limiting Future Collision Risk to Spacecraft an Assessment of NASA S Meteoroid and Orbital Debris Programs, (2011); undefined; Hypervelocity Impact Symposium, (2010); Cherniaev, Aleksandr V., Weight-efficiency of conventional shielding systems in protecting unmanned spacecraft from orbital debris, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 54, 1, pp. 75-89, (2017); Christiansen, Eric L., Flexible and deployable meteoroid/debris shielding for spacecraft, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 23, 1 PART I, pp. 125-136, (1999); 8th European Ls Dyna Conference, (2011); Zhang, Pinliang, Study of the shielding performance of a Whipple shield enhanced by Ti-Al-nylon impedance-graded materials, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 124, pp. 23-30, (2019); Carriere, Riley, Hypervelocity Impacts on Satellite Sandwich Structures—A Review of Experimental Findings and Predictive Models, Applied Mechanics, 2, 1, pp. 25-45, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Diabetic foot is one the most critical complications resultant of DM. Foot ulceration and infection are frequently arisen, which are associated with changes in the mechanical properties of the plantar soft tissues, peripheral arterial disease, and sensory neuropathy. Diabetic insoles are currently the mainstay in reducing the risk of foot ulcers by reducing the magnitude of the pressure on the plantar Here, we propose a novel pressure relieving heel pad based on a circular auxetic re-entrant honeycomb structure by using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to minimize the pressure on the heel, thus reducing the occurrence of foot ulcers. Finite element models (FEMs) are developed to evaluate the structural changes of the developed circular auxetic structure upon exertion of compressive forces. Moreover, the effects of the internal angle of the re-entrant structure on the peak contact force and the mean pressure acting on the heel as well as the contact area between the heel and the pads are investigated through a finite element analysis (FEA). Based on the result from the validated FEMs, the proposed heel pad with an auxetic structure demonstrates a distinct reduction in the peak contact force (∼10%) and the mean pressure (∼14%) in comparison to a conventional diabetic insole (PU foam). The characterized result of the designed circular auxetic structure not only provides new insights into diabetic foot protection, but also the design and development of various impact resistance products. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","3D printers; Diseases; Finite element method; Product design; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Contact forces; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic foot; Finite element modelling (FEM); Foot ulceration; Heel pads; Mean pressures; Soft tissue; Honeycomb structures; adult; Article; diabetic foot; finite element analysis; force; hardness; human; human experiment; male; normal human; plantar pressure; product design; three dimensional printing; diabetes mellitus; diabetic neuropathy; heel; shoe; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Foot; Diabetic Neuropathies; Finite Element Analysis; Heel; Humans; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Shoes","World Health Organization, (2006); Shah, Syed Ahmed, Improved drug delivery and accelerated diabetic wound healing by chondroitin sulfate grafted alginate-based thermoreversible hydrogels, Materials Science and Engineering C, 126, (2021); Zhang, Pengzi, Global epidemiology of diabetic foot ulceration: a systematic review and meta-analysis†, Annals of Medicine, 49, 2, pp. 106-116, (2017); Guven, Nese, Next step in 2nd generation glucose biosensors: Ferrocene-loaded electrospun nanofibers, Materials Science and Engineering C, 128, (2021); Tottoli, Erika Maria, Skin wound healing process and new emerging technologies for skin wound care and regeneration, Pharmaceutics, 12, 8, pp. 1-30, (2020); Tan, Chew Teng, Application of 3d bioprinting technologies to the management and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, Biomedicines, 8, 10, pp. 1-19, (2020); Armstrong, David G., Diabetic foot ulcers and their recurrence, New England Journal of Medicine, 376, 24, pp. 2367-2375, (2017); Lu, Guolan, Medical hyperspectral imaging: A review, Journal of Biomedical Optics, 19, 1, (2014); Khor, Benedictine Yen Chen, Plantar soft tissues and Achilles tendon thickness and stiffness in people with diabetes: a systematic review, Journal of Foot and Ankle Research, 14, 1, (2021); Cheung, Jason Tak Man, Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the foot during standing - A material sensitivity study, Journal of Biomechanics, 38, 5, pp. 1045-1054, (2005)",""

The results show that the deformation of HDH-VT can be classified into three typical modes, and the corresponding deformation mechanism is analyzed. Subsequently, comparisons of regular square honeycomb, HDH and HDH-VT are performed and illustrate that HDH-VT exhibits superior crashworthiness, and the reason for the superiority is analyzed. Moreover, the effects of basic parameters on the crashworthiness of HDH-VT are explored.

The sandwich panels are manufactured using carbon/fiber epoxy composite face sheets, polyurethane foam core and 3D-printed PLA plastic cellular auxetic (re-entrant) honeycombs. High-velocity impact tests are carried out by using a single-stage air gas gun test machine. A spherical steel projectile with the radius of 5 mm is impacted to the center of the specimens with the speed of 100 m/s. The experimental data are used to validate explicit finite element models of the doubly curved structures. An analytical model is also developed for the ballistic limit of the flat and doubly curved sandwich panels, and the analytical results are compared to those obtained from the numerical ones. Parametric numerical analyses of the high-speed impact of the curved sandwich panels are then carried out considering various radii of curvature of the panels. The results show that the energy absorption is increased as the curvature is decreased for the panels with both foam and re-entrant core. In addition, the core configuration provides a key role in the impact resistance of the sandwich panels.

However, most of the current investigations have either focused on discrete mass-spring lattices, with topological states limited to a single operating band, or on various elaborate continuous elastic systems, enduring the drawbacks of modal couplings. It remains largely unexplored how to design topological elastic systems that naturally possess multiple operating bands and are free from modal couplings. In this study, we design an elastic system based on fundamental mechanical elements (beams, rods and nuts), which is capable of supporting multiband pure topological states. Through an equivalent beam-spring model with lumped masses together with finite element analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed structure exhibits multiple Dirac points (DPs) at different frequencies. We show that simply adjusting the heights of nuts fastened on beams can lift the degeneracies, giving rise to two kinds of valley Hall phases characterized by opposite valley Chern numbers. The dispersion diagram of the supercell formed by unit cells with different topological indices shows that there simultaneously exist perfectly pure interface modes (i.e., no other modes coexist) within two frequency ranges. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrate that the domain wall formed by structures with distinct topological properties supports topologically protected interface waves over dual frequency ranges. Our results have potential for the design of mechanical systems that need to work under changeable working frequencies and may have significant impact on many diverse fields such as vibration control, energy harvesting and seismic isolation. © © 2022 Liu.","beam-spring model; elastic waves; honeycomb lattice; multiband states; topological states; valley Hall phases","Couplings; Domain walls; Elastic waves; Elasticity; Energy harvesting; Honeycomb structures; Landforms; Machine design; Seismic design; Vibrations (mechanical); Beam-spring model; Elastic systems; Hall phase; Honeycomb lattices; Modal coupling; Multi band; Multiband state; Operating bands; Topological state; Valley hall phase; Topology","Hasan, M.

The 3D-printed H-ReHs exhibit enhanced specific stiffness, specific initial-buckling strength, structural stability and specific energy absorption capacity due to the uniquely combined deformation mechanisms.

Findings: The quasi-static compression and low-speed impact mechanical properties can be greatly reduced by the pitting corrosion of the panel core, the pitting corrosion of the outer panel shows no obvious effect. The mechanical properties decrease with the increase of the pitting corrosion depth and DOP, and the influence of DOP is greater than that of pitting corrosion depth. The DOP of outer panel has less effect on mechanical properties of three-point bending compared with that of the core. Therefore, the pitting corrosion in the core of panel should be strictly controlled to prevent adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the structure. Originality/value: To make up for the deficiency of the research on the corrosion behavior of high-strength steel sandwich panel structure, this paper chose E690 high-strength steel panel as the research object, and nonlinear finite element method was adopted to simulate the influence of pitting corrosion coverage area and pitting depth on its mechanical property degradation. The quasi-static compression, low-speed impact and three-point bending mechanical properties of panel with various DOPs and pitting depths were systematic studied. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E690; Mechanical behavior; Peak load; Pitting corrosion; Simulation","Behavioral research; Corrosion prevention; Corrosive effects; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Pitting; Sandwich structures; Steel corrosion; Corrosion depth; E690; High-strength steels; Low speed; Mechanical behavior; Peak load; Quasi-static compression; Simulation; Speed impacts; Three-points bending; High strength steel","Anghel, Cǎlin Ioan, Risk assessment for pipelines with active defects based on artificial intelligence methods, International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping, 86, 7, pp. 403-411, (2009); Bai, Xiaohui, Heat transfer performance analysis on lattice core sandwich panel structures, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 143, (2019); Chiodo, Mario S.G., Failure assessments of corroded pipelines with axial defects using stress-based criteria: Numerical studies and verification analyses, International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping, 86, 2-3, pp. 164-176, (2009); Caleyo, Francisco, Probability distribution of pitting corrosion depth and rate in underground pipelines: A Monte Carlo study, Corrosion Science, 51, 9, pp. 1925-1934, (2009); Chen, Mindong, Influence of Rust Permeability on Corrosion of E690 Steel in Industrial and Non-industrial Marine Splash Zones, Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance, 27, 7, pp. 3742-3749, (2018); Farouk Deifalla, Ahmed Farouk, Design of lightweight concrete slabs under two-way shear without shear reinforcements: A comparative study and a new formula, Engineering Structures, 222, (2020); Fu, Qiang, A Computational Investigation of the Group Effect of Pits on the Ultimate Strength of Steel Plates, China Ocean Engineering, 32, 6, pp. 665-674, (2018); Han, Lihong, Fatigue and corrosion fatigue behaviors of G105 and S135 high−strength drill pipe steels in air and H2S environment, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 124, pp. 63-74, (2019); Kwon, Kiyoun, Welding length estimation based on lightweight model for construction of offshore structures, Transactions of the Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers, A, 43, 2, pp. 111-118, (2019); Kalinin, S.

The current prevailing approach to assessing the impact resistance of these structures broadly hinges on mechanics-informed nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. However, this method is computationally expensive and ill-suited for tackling the implementation of automated condition monitoring schemes. To address these issues, first, this paper proposes a hybrid hierarchical auxetic structure named Hybrid-Hierarchical Re-entrant Honeycomb (HHRH) that is endowed with impact stress-reducing capabilities. Next, using explicit FE, the investigation uncovers the interplay between the key geometric features of this HHRH auxetic structure and the impact performance under low, intermediate, and high crushing velocities. The outcome of the nonlinear explicit FE simulations is then unified with random forests (RF) scheme towards the establishment of intelligent auxetic structural systems. The results revealed that the developed HHRH maintained the auxeticity of the regular re-entrant auxetic and exhibited superior performance in some crushing strain regions. Moreover, the HHRH structure manifests up to an 85 % reduction in peak stress and the proposed reinforcement boosts the auxetic property by up to 23 % when compared to the regular re-entrant auxetic structure under high-velocity applications. Regarding the established data-driven RF-enabled machine learning model, its predictive strength with optimally-tuned hyperparameters is demonstrated to excellently capture the nonlinear multi-modal crushing stress response at various crushing strains, velocities, and geometric variations.

For this purpose, firstly, a glass fiber resin epoxy sandwich panel has been fabricated in the laboratory. In this regard, the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) method has been used to achieve a laminate without any fault. In order to improve the impact resistance of the composite, the nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> were added to the resin epoxy matrix as filler with the ratios of 1%, 2%, and 3% of the composite's total weight. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been utilized to observe the microscopic structure of the composites, and it shows an exceptional homogeneous mixture of nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> particles in the resin epoxy matrix. From the experiment results, it was figured out that by adding 1 to 3 wt% of nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> into the composite, the output velocity of the projectile decreases. On the other hand, the results showed that when the projectile collides with the core of the sandwich panel, it remains in the sandwich panel and its output velocity will be zero. However, when the projectile does not completely collide with the core, the output velocity of the projectile will not be zero. In order to validate the results, a finite element analysis (FEA) has been developed to simulate the high-velocity impact test. Then the experimental data has been compared to numerical simulation and good agreement was observed. © 2022 Society of Plastics Engineers.","finite element analysis; high-velocity impact; M-shaped core; Nano-SiO2; Sandwich panel","Epoxy resins; Honeycomb structures; Projectiles; Reinforcement; Resin transfer molding; Resins; Sandwich structures; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Silicon; Vacuum applications; Velocity; Composite sandwich panels; Epoxy matrices; Experimental investigations; Finite element analyse; High-velocity impact; M-shaped core; Nano-SiO 2; Numerical investigations; Output velocity; Sandwich panel; Finite element method","Hashemi, Soheil, An Analytical Solution for Nonlinear Vibrations Analysis of Functionally Graded Plate Using Modified Lindstedt-Poincare Method, International Journal of Applied Mechanics, 12, 1, (2020); Hashemi, Soheil, Nonlinear Free and Forced Vibrations of In-Plane Bi-Directional Functionally Graded Rectangular Plate with Temperature-Dependent Properties, International Journal of Structural Stability and Dynamics, 20, 8, (2020); Hashemi, Soheil, An analytical solution for nonlinear vibration analysis of functionally graded rectangular plate in contact with fluid, Advances in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, 13, 4, pp. 914-941, (2021); Mech Eng, (2021); Hashemi, Soheil, Nonlinear Free Vibration Analysis of In-plane Bi-directional Functionally Graded Plate with Porosities Resting on Elastic Foundations, International Journal of Applied Mechanics, 14, 1, (2022); Iranian Journal of Mechanical Engineering Transactions of the Isme, (2020); Buitrago, Brenda L., Modelling of composite sandwich structures with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2090-2096, (2010); Ivañez, Inés, Numerical modelling of foam-cored sandwich plates under high-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 93, 9, pp. 2392-2399, (2011); Nasirzadeh, Rasoul, Study of foam density variations in composite sandwich panels under high velocity impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 63, pp. 129-139, (2014); Norouzi, Hosain, Experimental and numerical study of flatwise compression behavior of carbon fiber composite sandwich panels with new lattice cores, Construction and Building Materials, 100, pp. 22-30, (2015)",""

At first, twelve honeycomb sandwich panels (HSPs) were analyzed under ballistic impact test conditions. The HSPs consisted of Q345 steel top-sheets, CFRP bottom-sheet, and a honeycomb aluminum core with three kinds of cell configurations (regular, reentrant, and enhanced reentrant hexagons, respectively). The performances of the HSPs were compared to a control set of Al foam-cored sandwich panels of identical areal densities. The results demonstrated that the auxetic honeycomb core improves the ballistic impact performance of HSPs by reducing the residual velocity and enhancing the damage tolerances. For the numerical research, the HSPs responses are deduced by finite element modeling. Parametric investigations were conducted to investigate the influences of the honeycomb type, unit cell angle and face-sheet type on the ballistic resistance of the HSPs. Numerical studies present that the ballistic limits and the HSP perforation energy are significantly influenced by the above factors. © 2022","Auxetic honeycomb; Ballistic impact; LS-DYNA; Parametric study; Sandwich panels","3D printers; Ballistics; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Sandwich structures; Auxetic honeycomb; Auxetics; Ballistic impact; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Face sheets; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact performance; LS-DYNA; Parametric study; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Li, Xin, Dynamic behavior of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels under air blast: Experiment and numerical analysis, Composite Structures, 108, 1, pp. 1001-1008, (2014); Qi, Chang, Impact and close-in blast response of auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels: Experimental tests and numerical simulations, Composite Structures, 180, pp. 161-178, (2017); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018); Jin, Xiaochao, Dynamic response of sandwich structures with graded auxetic honeycomb cores under blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 106, pp. 206-217, (2016); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Three-dimensional modelling of auxetic sandwich panels for localised impact resistance, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 19, 3, pp. 291-316, (2017); Yang, Chulho, Behavior of auxetic structures under compression and impact forces, Smart Materials and Structures, 27, 2, (2018); Hou, Shaoyu, Mechanical properties of sandwich composites with 3d-printed auxetic and non-auxetic lattice cores under low velocity impact, Materials and Design, 160, pp. 1305-1321, (2018); Yazdani Sarvestani, Hamidreza, 3D printed architected polymeric sandwich panels: Energy absorption and structural performance, Composite Structures, 200, pp. 886-909, (2018); Li, Ying, The Dynamic response of shallow sandwich arch with auxetic metallic honeycomb core under localized impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 137, (2020); Usta, Fatih, Low-velocity impact resistance of composite sandwich panels with various types of auxetic and non-auxetic core structures, Thin-Walled Structures, 163, (2021)",""

Although these structures have been extensively studied under axial impacts, a key question remains largely unaddressed: How may their axial and shear responses be independently tailored for oblique impacts? Here we test whether incorporating curvature in the form of axisymmetric shape changes in the cell walls of viscoelastic circular cell honeycombs enables independent control over their shear and compressive responses during oblique impacts. We developed detailed finite element models of the circular cell honeycombs made of the 3D printable viscoelastic material Agilus. Using a new rig, we validated the predictions of the finite element models under oblique impacts. We performed a full-factorial computational design-of-experiments, varying the cell shape from concave to convex with different amplitudes and impact velocities from 2.5 to 7.5 m/s in order to determine their effects on the shear and compressive responses of the honeycombs under oblique impacts. The finite element models demonstrate remarkable agreement with experimental oblique impacts for both concave and convex cells. Our full-factorial computational search shows that both convex and concave cells have similar compressive stresses. However, the post-buckling shear stress of the concave cells are up to 300% larger than the convex cells. In addition, increasing the impact velocity increases both compressive and shear stresses by 211% due to the viscoelastic nature of the material. Our results show that these new recoverable honeycombs provide a compelling control over their shear response under oblique impacts, which is nearly independent from their compressive response. These new honeycombs can be used to manage oblique impacts in a wide range of products, such as helmets, shoes and seats, where enabling an independent control over shear and compressive responses will open new design avenues. In addition, the proposed simple control mechanism, i.e. the curvature change, can be exploited in future to actively morph the honeycomb cells during use for real-time performance adjustment. © 2022 The Author(s)","Cellular structures; Energy absorption; Honeycomb; Oblique impact; Viscoelastic","3D printers; Cells; Cellular automata; Cytology; Design of experiments; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Product design; Shear flow; Structural design; Viscoelasticity; Cellular structure; Circular cell honeycomb; Compressive response; Finite element modelling (FEM); Honeycomb; Impact loads; Independent control; Oblique impact; Shear response; Viscoelastics; Shear stress","Khosroshahi, Siamak Farajzadeh, The effects of topology and relative density of lattice liners on traumatic brain injury mitigation, Journal of Biomechanics, 97, (2019); Abram, Daniel E., A modular impact diverting mechanism for football helmets, Journal of Biomechanics, 99, (2020); Fulcher, Ben A., Analytical and experimental investigation of buckled beams as negative stiffness elements for passive vibration and shock isolation systems, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 136, 3, (2014); Shariatmadari, Mohammad Reza, Effects of temperature on the material characteristics of midsole and insole footwear foams subject to quasi-static compressive and shear force loading, Materials and Design, 37, pp. 543-559, (2012); Shimazaki, Y., Shock-absorption properties of functionally graded EVA laminates for footwear design, Polymer Testing, 54, pp. 98-103, (2016); Nazzi, Francesco, The hexagonal shape of the honeycomb cells depends on the construction behavior of bees, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Yu, Zhilong, Bioinspired polymeric woods, Science Advances, 4, 8, (2018); undefined, (2014); Shepherd, Todd, Validation of a Finite Element Modeling Process for Auxetic Structures under Impact, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 257, 10, (2020); Tan, Xiaojun, A novel cylindrical negative stiffness structure for shock isolation, Composite Structures, 214, pp. 397-405, (2019)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Dynamic deformation process, deformation/failure modes, and permanent deflections of polyurea-coated sandwich panels are testified at various projectile momentum and compared with those of non-coated sandwich panels. A high-fidelity finite element (FE) model considering both rate-dependent compressive and tensile behaviors of polyurea elastomer is established and employed to simulate the dynamic response of polyurea-coated sandwich panels, interrogate the underlying enhancement mechanisms, and estimate the effects of projectile momentum and coating thickness/area/position upon permanent mid-span deflection and energy absorption. Reasonable agreement is realized between FE predictions and measurements. The presence of polyurea coating helps curtail permanent deflection in the central region and avoid shear failure around the clamping area. The benefit of polyurea coating on mitigating impact deformation remains stable as the projectile momentum is varied over a broad range, and the use of thicker, larger, and impact-side coating is preferred. The observed performance improvement is attributed mainly to enhanced plastic bending moment and membrane force in the polyurea-coated sandwich panel.

In this study, the impact resistance of corrugated sandwich panels prepared from thermoplastic composites (TPC) under low-velocity impact loading was investigated. Through a series of drop-weight experiments and finite element simulations, the impact response process and damage morphology of the thermoplastic composite sandwich panels were obtained, and the effects of different impact energy and different core arrangements on the energy absorption performance of the structure were explored. Finally, a parametric analysis of the perpendicularly-arranged double-layered corrugated sandwich panel was carried out. The results show that thermoplastic composite sandwich panels exhibit an overall collapse response rather than localised damage, and the structure maintains good integrity and stability. The perpendicularly-arranged sandwich panels rely on the orthogonal configuration characteristics to provide optimum impact load carrying capacity, their impact resistance can be further improved by increasing the thickness of top face-sheet and reducing the thickness of the middle face-sheet at the same time. This provides a basis for promoting the application of TPC in engineering and the design of sandwich structures. © The Author(s) 2022.","corrugated sandwich panel; dynamic response; low-velocity impact; structural integrity; Thermoplastic composite","Load limits; Loads (forces); Reinforced plastics; Sandwich structures; Velocity; Aerospace field; Composite sandwich panels; Corrugated sandwich panel; Corrugated sandwich structures; Experimental and numerical studies; Face sheets; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Sandwich panel; Thermoplastic composite; Honeycomb structures","Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Tian, Y.

The artificial satellite is simplified as a honeycomb sandwich panel and multi-layer plates. We carried out a ground damage test and finite element dynamic simulation, and we determined the lateral effect and penetration performance of the projectile. Then, we studied the dynamic behavior of the projectile penetrating the honeycomb sandwich panel using a theoretical model. We found that its ballistic limit velocity was 150 m/s, and the deformation of the opening had little relationship with the projectile velocity. Finally, we studied the dynamic response of the kinetic projectile impacting the multi-layer plates under various launch parameters. We found that the launch velocity required to meet the damage requirements was within 325 ± 25 m/s. Projectiles with a higher initial velocity had a stronger ability to penetrate the plates, but initial velocities higher than 325 m/s led to a reduced damage area. The kinetic projectile could adapt to incident angles less than 5◦ when damaging the plates. With the increasing incident angle, the penetration ability was reduced, and the damage area increased. © 2022 by the authors.

In the present study, the segmented graded hierarchical honeycomb structures with triangle substructures (GHT) are constructed to numerically investigate the in-plane crushing performance by the nonlinear finite element analysis code ABAQUS/Explicit. GHT exhibits the best energy absorption capacity compared to graded regular hexagonal honeycomb structures (GRH), graded hierarchical structures with Kagome substructures (GHK) and graded hierarchical structures with hexagonal substructures (GHH). The comprehensive effect of inertia and yield strength at each layer is illustrated by investigating the deformation modes under different loading speeds. The plateau stress is discussed in two ways: the overall average plateau stress corresponding to the whole structure and the segmental plateau stress corresponding to the specific layer. The relationship between overall average plateau stress, relative density and loading speed for the graded structure is established based on one-dimensional shock wave theory and compared with the uniform structure. The segmental properties of plateau stress at both impact and fixed ends are investigated in detail by combining theoretical analysis and deformation characteristics, and the results show good consistency with the simulation results at low, medium, and high loading speed conditions. Finally, the concept of cyclic graded structure is introduced, which can further optimize the energy absorption capacity and provide guidance for the design of new multifunctional structures. © The Author(s) 2022.","energy absorption; Hierarchical graded honeycombs; in-plane loading; plateau stress","ABAQUS; Deformation; Energy absorption; Shock waves; Stress analysis; Compression energy; Compression properties; Energy absorption capacity; Graded structure; Hierarchical graded honeycomb; Hierarchical structures; In-plane compression; Inplane loading; Loading speed; Plateau stress; Honeycomb structures","Ajdari, Amin, Mechanical properties and energy absorption of heterogeneous and functionally graded cellular structures, Procedia Engineering, 10, pp. 219-223, (2011); Ajdari, Amin, Mechanical properties of functionally graded 2-D cellular structures: A finite element simulation, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 499, 1-2, pp. 434-439, (2009); Ajdari, Amin, Hierarchical honeycombs with tailorable properties, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 49, 11-12, pp. 1413-1419, (2012); Ali, Muhammad, Theoretical and finite element study of a compact energy absorber, Advances in Engineering Software, 39, 2, pp. 95-106, (2008); An, Liqiang, In-plane dynamic crushing and energy absorption capacity of self, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 9, 6, (2017); Ashikhmina, Ekaterina R., Numerical simulation and experimental validation of effective thermal conductivity coefficient of hexagonal aramid honeycomb used in wing skin of tourist class reusable spaceplane, Materials Today: Proceedings, 38, pp. 2025-2030, (2021); Bhattacharya, Anandaroop, Thermophysical properties of high porosity metal foams, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 45, 5, pp. 1017-1031, (2002); Chang, Patrick S., The size matching and scaling method: A synthesis method for the design of mesoscale cellular structures, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 26, 10, pp. 907-927, (2013); Deshpande, Vikram S., Energy absorption of an egg-box material, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 51, 1, pp. 187-208, (2003); Edwards, Nathan J., Dynamic shear testing of 2024 T351 aluminium at elevated temperature, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 754, pp. 99-111, (2019)",""

A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of AHSP under ice impact is established based on a concrete constitutive ice model in the commercial package ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The impact force-displacement curves and energy absorption properties as well as the crushing process of ice wedge are numerically achieved. In addition, the ice wedge impact tests of AHSPs were conducted by using a horizontal impact experimental apparatus. Furthermore, the effects of impact parameters and structural parameters on the dynamic responses and energy absorption are performed. Results show that the numerical results of ice wedge-AHSP impact dynamic responses are consistent well with the experimental results. The permanent deformation profiles of face sheets are approximately axisymmetric about the vertical and horizontal centerline. The ice impact energy is mainly converted into the plastic deformation energy of AHSP and rebound kinetic energy of ice wedge as well as the fracture energy of ice wedge.

Numerical and experimental compression tests results under axial and lateral loads are analyzed. The proposed cell geometry was designed to overcome the limitations posed by standard hexagonal honeycombs, which show relatively low stiffness and energy absorption under loads that have a significant lateral component. To achieve this, the new cell geometry was designed with internal diagonal walls to support the external walls, increasing its stiffness and impact energy absorption in comparison with the hexagonal cell. 3D-printed unit-cell specimens made from ABS thermoplastic material were subjected to experimental quasi-static compression tests, in both lateral and axial directions. Energy absorption was compared to that of the standard hexagonal cell, with the same mass and height. Finite element models were developed and validated using experimental data. Results show that the innovative geometry absorbs approximately 15% more energy under lateral compression, while maintaining the same level of energy absorption of the standard hexagonal cell in the axial direction.

At present, the specific materials have been widely used in aerospace, transportation, mechanical construction, energy, and chemical industry. The mechanical properties of honeycomb steel with special coating under quasi-static and dynamic compression were studied by using the universal strength testing machine (TAWD-2000) and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) devices. The results showed that the stress–strain curves obtained from the quasi-static compression experiment showed the characteristics of three typical deformation stages of porous materials: the elastic deformation stage, stress platform stage, and densification stage. Due to the fact that the loading time of the dynamic compression experiment is very short and because of the effect of the sample’s height, there was no densification stage in the stress–strain curves under dynamic loading. The dynamic compression deformation process of the samples was captured by the high-speed photography equipment, and its different deformations and failure modes were analyzed in combination with the characteristics of stress–strain curves. The increasing relationship between the peak stress and strain rate showed the strain rate sensitivity of the honeycomb structure. The dynamic energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb materials were described and analyzed by using the dynamic energy absorption capacity and dynamic energy absorption efficiency. By using finite element simulation software, the same structure of the honeycomb steel was modeled and analyzed to explore the causes of dynamic compression failure. Because of its special mechanical properties and failure modes, this honeycomb structure material will have a broader research and application prospect in the future. © © 2022 Luo, Yuan, Fan, Suo and Mou.","energy absorption; failure modes; honeycomb steel; numerical simulation; SHPB","Computer software; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; High speed cameras; High speed photography; Honeycomb structures; Materials handling; Mechanical testing; Porous materials; Steel testing; Strain rate; Stress analysis; Densifications; Dynamic behaviors; Dynamic compression; Dynamic energy absorption; Honeycomb materials; Honeycomb steel; Impact dynamics; Numerical simulation; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Stress/strain curves; Energy absorption","Deshpande, Vikram S., High strain rate compressive behaviour of aluminum alloy foams, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 24, 3, pp. 277-298, (2000); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Dynamic compression of metallic sandwich structures during planar impulsive loading in water, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 29, 1, pp. 56-67, (2010); Fíla, Tomáš, Strain Dependency of Poisson's Ratio of SLS Printed Auxetic Lattices Subjected to Quasi-Static and Dynamic Compressive Loading, Advanced Engineering Materials, 21, 8, (2019); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Akil, Hazizan Md., The low velocity impact response of an aluminium honeycomb sandwich structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 34, 8, pp. 679-687, (2003); Hohe, Jörg, Effective elastic properties of triangular grid structures, Composite Structures, 45, 2, pp. 131-145, (1999); Hohe, Jörg, Effective elastic properties of hexagonal and quadrilateral grid structures, Composite Structures, 46, 1, pp. 73-89, (1999); Hong, Huan, Dynamic mechanical behavior of hierarchical resin honeycomb by 3D printing, Polymers, 23, 1, pp. 1-14, (2021); Materials for Mechanical Engineering, (2007); Li, Zhen, Design-oriented crushing analysis of hexagonal honeycomb core under in-plane compression, Composite Structures, 187, pp. 429-438, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

This challenge often needs to be combined with the need to deliver engineering solutions that are able to lower the environmental impact of transportation, by reducing fuel consumption. Consequentially, these topics have attracted considerable research efforts. The present work aims to address the previously cited challenges by maximizing the energy absorption capabilities of hybrid aluminum/composite shock absorbers with minimal thickness and mass. This engineering solution makes it possible to lighten vehicles and reduce fuel consumption, without compromising safety, in terms of crashworthiness capabilities. A numerical sensitivity study is presented, where the absorbed energy/mass (AE/m) and the absorbed energy/total panel thickness (AE/Htot) ratios, as a consequence of low-velocity impact simulations performed on six different shock absorbers, are compared. These hybrid shock absorbers have been numerically designed by modifying the core thickness of two basic absorbers’ configurations, characterized, respectively, by a metallic lattice core, intended to be produced through additive manufacturing, and a standard metallic honeycomb core. This work provides interesting information for the development of shock absorbers, which should be further developed with an experimental approach. Indeed, it demonstrates that, by inte-grating composite skins with a very light core producible, by means of additive manufacturing ca-pabilities, it is possible to design shock absorbers with excellent performance, even for very thin configurations with 6 mm thickness, and to provide a significant increase in AE/m ratios when compared to the respective equal volume standard honeycomb core configurations. This difference between the AE/m ratios of configurations with different core designs increases with the growth in volume. In detail, for configurations with a total thickness of 6 mm, the AE/m increases in additive manufacturing configurations by approximately 93%; for those with a total thickness of 10 mm, the increase is 175%, and, finally, for those with a total thickness of 14 mm, the increase is 220%. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, the dynamic response of U-type corrugated sandwich panels under low-velocity impact using a drop-weight apparatus at the impact velocity of 4.43 m/s was measured and compared with finite element predictions. Moreover, the effect of impact velocity and location were evaluated. Both the experimental and simulation results indicated that the deformation modes of the front face were localized indentation, membrane stretching and wrinkle formation around the contact area between the front face and indenter, however the deformation modes of the corrugated cores were indentation and global bending. The dynamic responses of the sandwich panel determined through experiment and numerical simulation were consistent, revealing that the numerical simulation demonstrated reasonable accuracy. When the impact velocity increased from 2.8 to 4.85 m/s, the loading process and deformation modes of the sandwich panel were mainly influenced by the properties of the structure. The transverse impact resistance performance of the U-type corrugated sandwich panel was better than the longitudinal performance, owing to the higher number of core cells involved in deformation and energy absorption. © 2021","Drop-weight impact test; Dynamic response; Low-velocity impact; Numerical simulation; U-type corrugated sandwich panel","Deformation; Dynamic response; Numerical models; Ocean engineering; Sandwich structures; Ships; Velocity; Deformation modes; Drop-weight impact test; Drop-weight impacts; Front face; Impact velocities; Low velocity impact; Ocean engineering structures; Sandwich panel; Ship structure; U-type corrugated sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures; computer simulation; dynamic response; experimental study; mechanical property; numerical model; ship design; ship technology","Calladine, Christopher R., Strain-rate and inertia effects in the collapse of two types of energy-absorbing structure, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 26, 11-12, pp. 689-701, (1984); Chen, Changqing, Plastic collapse of sandwich beams with a metallic foam core, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 43, 6, pp. 1483-1506, (2001); Côté, François, Structural response of pyramidal core sandwich columns, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 44, 10, pp. 3533-3556, (2007); Crupi, Vincenzo, Collapse modes in aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 6-15, (2012); ASM Handbook, (2000); Mechanical Metallurgy, (1986); Duffey, Thomas A., Experimental verification of scaling laws for punch-impact-loaded structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 2, 1, pp. 103-117, (1984); Fleck, Norman A., The resistance of clamped sandwich beams to shock loading, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 71, 3, pp. 386-401, (2004); Formisano, Antonio, Mechanical behavior and collapse mechanisms of innovative aluminum foam-based sandwich panels under three-point bending, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 112, 5-6, pp. 1631-1639, (2021); He, Wentao, Experimental and numerical research on the low velocity impact behavior of hybrid corrugated core sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 158, pp. 30-43, (2016)",""

Experimental tests were performed by employing the high pressurised pneumatic gun at the subordinance velocity range (60–145 m/s). The experimental results obtained in terms of residual velocity, ballistic limit and failure pattern were validated with 3D finite element analysis performed in Abaqus/explicit solver. Furthermore, The Johnson Cook constitutive strength and fracture model, and ductile damage model was used to capture the damage and fracture evolution. Furthermore, a user-defined code was used to calculate the energy dissipation in plastic transverse deflection in different stretching directions. In addition, the influence of core geometries, i.e. cell wall thickness and side length, and face skin thickness on impact response of the structure, were calculated. From the result, it was found that irrespective of the geometrical parameters, localised dishing with petals formation, core crushing with hole formation was typical failure mode. Also, the geometrical parameters had a substantial effect on the transverse deflection, ballistic limit and energy absorption. The EA increased by 22.76% and 270.3% when the cell wall and skin thickness increased from 0.03 to 0.05 mm and 0.7 mm to 2.0 mm, respectively. However, EA decreased by 26.32% when the side length increased from 3.2 to 9.2 mm. Moreover, Increasing the face skin thickness and reducing the side length are two weight-efficient ways to enhance the perforation resistance for structure. Also, the energy dissipation cylindrical sandwich structure was highest in the circumferential direction followed by the tangential, radial and axial direction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ballistic performance; Curve sandwich panel; Energy dissipation characteristic; High velocity impact","ABAQUS; Energy dissipation; Geometry; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Velocity; Ballistic performance; Curve sandwich panel; Cylindrical sandwich shells; Dissipation behaviour; Energy dissipation characteristics; High-velocity impact; Honeycomb core; Sandwich panel; Side length; Skin thickness; Honeycomb structures","Arslan, Kemal, Experimental tests and numerical modeling of ballistic impact on honeycomb sandwich structures reinforced by functionally graded plates, Journal of Composite Materials, 51, 29, pp. 4009-4028, (2017); Buitrago, Brenda L., Modelling of composite sandwich structures with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2090-2096, (2010); Kolopp, Amélie, Experimental study of sandwich structures as armour against medium-velocity impacts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 61, pp. 24-35, (2013); Sun, Guangyong, High-velocity impact behaviour of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels with different structural configurations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 122, pp. 119-136, (2018); Zhang, Qingnan, Ballistic impact behaviors of aluminum alloy sandwich panels with honeycomb cores: An experimental study, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 20, 7, pp. 861-884, (2018); Yahaya, Mohd Azman, Response of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to foam projectile impact - An experimental study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 100-109, (2015); Liaghat, Gholamhossein, Ballistic limit evaluation for impact of cylindrical projectiles on honeycomb panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 48, 1, pp. 55-61, (2010); Feli, Saeed, An analytical model for composite sandwich panels with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 43, 5, pp. 2439-2447, (2012); Alavi, Ali, Ballistic limit determination of aluminum honeycombs-Experimental study, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 488, 1-2, pp. 273-280, (2008); Zhao, Na, Experimental and numerical investigation on the anti-penetration performance of metallic sandwich plates for marine applications, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 22, 2, pp. 494-522, (2020)",""

Both the physical testing and the finite element results show that the core damage depth is dependent on the adhesive fillet height and can be linearly correlated with the dent depth. The focus of the finite element simulation is on representing the adhesive fillet height and the constraint that it provides for the cell walls at the interface with the face-sheet. A hybrid method combining the numerical study and the Bayesian method was proposed to predict the range of core damage depths from the numerical simulations based on the variability of the adhesive fillets. The variation of the adhesive fillet height between different cell walls significantly influences the core damage depth and cannot be ignored when predicting the range of the core damage depth. The non-uniform distribution of the adhesive fillets causes the core damage depth to vary within a range of up to 20% of the core thickness for the panel configurations considered in this study. © 2021","A.

A compressed air gun was used for experiments and the incidence velocities of both the impactor were kept within the range of 50 -146 m/s.

However, aerospace composite structures are prone to damage due to high-velocity impact events such as bird strike, hail impact, etc. These impact events can result in extensive damage including structure perforation, which will eventually degrade its post-impact residual strength. Therefore, the early detection of damage in composite structure is imperative to avoid catastrophic failure. This paper develops the computational models which predict the dynamic behavior of a helicopter composite sandwich structure undergoing a bird strike. The models are aimed to be used as virtual tools for a future digital-twin-assisted fault detection technique. Firstly, a high-fidelity (HF) FE/SPH model was developed in LS-DYNA, and it was validated against the soft body impact experiments. Afterwards, a computationally efficient low-fidelity (LF) model was developed and correlated with the high-fidelity model. It was concluded that the high-fidelity model can sufficiently accurately predict the strain history experimentally recorded by the FBG sensors, and that size of the predicted delamination area at the front face of the sandwich structure agrees very well with the experimentally observed delamination area. It was also shown that the LF model can rapidly predict the global dynamic response of sandwich panel under the impact loading, through the good agreement between the numerical strain histories with the FBG measurements. Consequently, the LF model can be used as a quick numerical guide for the identification of the loading condition, whereas the HF model can be used as virtual damage detector and estimator of damage extension before the scheduled inspection. © 2021","Bird strike; Composites; Digital twin; FBG sensors; FEM-SPH; LS-DYNA; Sandwich panel; Soft body impact","Aerospace industry; Birds; Damage detection; Forecasting; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural dynamics; Structural panels; Structure (composition); Bird strike; FBG sensor; FEM-SPH; High-fidelity modeling; Impact events; Low-fidelity models; LS-DYNA; Sandwich panel; Soft body impact; Soft-bodies; Finite element method","undefined, (2018); Loss of Thrust in both Engines After Encountering A Flock of Birds and Subsequent Ditching on the Hudson River, (2010); Eur Aviation Saf Agency, (2016); Eur Aviation Saf Agency, (2016); International Conference on Computational Experimental Engineering and Sciences, (2007); Smojver, Ivica, Bird strike damage analysis in aircraft structures using Abaqus/Explicit and coupled Eulerian Lagrangian approach, Composites Science and Technology, 71, 4, pp. 489-498, (2011); Jang, Jun-hwan, Bird-Strike Damage Analysis and Preliminary Design of Composite Radome Structure Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, Applied Composite Materials, 26, 3, pp. 763-782, (2019); Guida, Michele, Certification by birdstrike analysis on C27J fullscale ribless composite leading edge, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 54, pp. 105-113, (2013); Hedayati, Reza, A new bird model and the effect of bird geometry in impacts from various orientations, Aerospace Science and Technology, 28, 1, pp. 9-20, (2013); Hedayati, Reza, Effect of bird geometry and orientation on bird-target impact analysis using SPH method, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 17, 4, pp. 445-459, (2012)","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

A finite element-based optimisation was performed using a search algorithm based on a radial basis function. This approach identified optimisation configurations of a pre-buckled honeycomb structure, based on structural bounds subject to impact loading conditions. Furthermore, the influence of objective function, peak acceleration and head injury criterion was analysed with respect to the resultant mechanical behaviour of the structure. Numerical results demonstrate that this class of structure can exceed the performance threshold of a common helmet design standard and minimise the resultant injury index. Experimental testing, facilitated through laser sintering of thermoplastic polyurethane powder, validated the output of the numerical optimisation. When subject to initial impact loading, the fabricated samples satisfied their objective functions. Successive impact loading was performed to assess the performance and degradation. Samples optimised for peak acceleration demonstrated superior performance after stabilisation, relative to their initial response. The culmination of this study establishes a numerical design pathway for future optimisation of candidate structures for head impact protection. Furthermore, the optimised pre-buckled honeycomb structure represents a new class of energy absorbing structure, which can exceed the thresholds prescribed by the design standard. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis; Helmet; Honeycomb; Impact; Optimisation","3D printers; Accident prevention; Fabrication; Honeycomb structures; Laser heating; Radial basis function networks; Safety devices; Shape optimization; Sintering; Design standard; Element-based; Finite element analyse; Helmet liners; Impact; Impact loadings; Objective functions; Optimisations; Peak acceleration; Performance; Finite element method","McNally, Donal S., A computational simulation study of the influence of helmet wearing on head injury risk in adult cyclists, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 60, pp. 15-23, (2013); Dodds, Nicholas I., Evaluating the impact of cycle helmet use on severe traumatic brain injury and death in a national cohort of over 11000 pedal cyclists: A retrospective study from the NHS England Trauma Audit and Research Network dataset, BMJ Open, 9, 9, (2019); Forbes, Anna E., Head injury patterns in helmeted and non-helmeted cyclists admitted to a London Major Trauma Centre with serious head injury, PLOS ONE, 12, 9, (2017); Bottlang, Michael, Impact Performance Comparison of Advanced Bicycle Helmets with Dedicated Rotation-Damping Systems, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 48, 1, pp. 68-78, (2020); Abayazid, Fady F., A New Assessment of Bicycle Helmets: The Brain Injury Mitigation Effects of New Technologies in Oblique Impacts, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 49, 10, pp. 2716-2733, (2021); undefined, (2006); Thompson, Diane C., Helmets for preventing head and facial injuries in bicyclists., Nursing Times, 97, 43, (2001); Melo, Nicolas, Injuries sustained by bicyclists, Trauma (United Kingdom), 16, 3, pp. 183-188, (2014); McIntosh, Andrew Stuart, Sports helmets now and in the future, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 45, 16, pp. 1258-1265, (2011); Soe, Shwe Pyi, Feasibility of optimising bicycle helmet design safety through the use of additive manufactured TPE cellular structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 79, 9-12, pp. 1975-1982, (2015)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Additive manufacturing technologies are part of a growing field that represents high interest for industries such as aerospace, automotive and naval. This paper aims to determine the mechanical properties of a 3D printed polymer - Polylactic Acid (PLA) manufactured by FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) technology. In this regard, first the material is characterized by low velocity impact dynamic experimental tests. A finite Element Analysis (FEA) is performed in LS-Dyna software in order to validate the results. The samples were manufactured by varying the infill percent to investigate the influence of different parameters on a batch of samples for every configuration. The 3D CAD modelling for impact tests samples were performed in Catia V5. Among wide range of cellular structures, honeycomb non-auxetic hexagonal cell pattern was selected in this study, assuring high strength/weight ratio. The amount of energy absorbed during the impact, the failure and degradation of the impacted specimens were monitored, following the analysis of experimental and numerical data. A fair agreement was obtained between experimental and numerical results, showing that honeycomb developed lightweight structures exhibits a proper energy absorption capacity, with a mechanism of release similar to metal or composite materials honeycombs. © 2022 Syscom 18 SRL.

Four honeycombs, namely regular honeycombs, linear graded honeycombs, and two nonlinear graded honeycombs, were modeled. An indicator of deformation uniformity was proposed to characterize the dynamic deformation status of various honeycomb structures. The dynamic responses, including crushing mode, stress-strain relation, and energy absorption, were compared by changing the type of cell distribution and impact velocity. It is found that the honeycomb with the nonlinear graded cellular structure possesses a smoother crushing process due to the existence of a high-density frame. Nonlinear graded honeycombs present better dynamic performances at lower impacting velocity, like plateau stress and energy absorption. When the loading velocity is higher, the nonlinear graded honeycombs have more stable dynamic responses than the regular honeycomb, like plateau stress, dynamic increment factor, and specific energy absorption. © 2022,Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures.

The finite element method (FEM) is used to model the dynamic structural response to explosions. Explicit finite element modeling and analysis are performed using ABAQUS CAE software. An air explosion simulation code is used to determine the blast load on the lower skin plate of a test panel on a typical armored personnel vehicle. Structural analysis is carried out with respect to displacement, von-Mises stress, and internal kinetic energy. Three variations of explosive loads are considered in the simulation in order to better compare the responses of the structures.

A systematic investigation of the in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors of the honeycombs was conducted via the finite element method, and the crashworthiness characteristics of the three honeycombs were examined. Using one-dimensional shock wave theory and least squares fitting, a fitting formula of the plateau stress was obtained, and the deformation mechanism of the HKH was determined based on the elastic buckling of the cell wall. The results showed that the HKH exhibited a higher plateau stress than the RHH for any velocity impact, while the negative Poisson's ratio effect was more significant than that of the KH for low-velocity impacts (the peak Poisson's ratios of the HKH and KH were -0.312 and -0.286, respectively).

Different face sheets materials ranging from aluminium alloys to composites such as carbon/epoxy and kevlar/epoxy fixed on different types of core were analyzed. Sandwiched structure with aluminium alloy face sheet showed minimum deformation of the impacting point, large impactor recoil and least strain energy absorption. Whereas carbon/epoxy face sheet showed large deformation of the impacting point for all the core designs. Employing the carbon/epoxy face sheet, the impactor recoiled only with square and hexagonal core design while the strain energy absorption was minimum for square and maximum for circular core designs. Kevlar/epoxy face sheet also showed large deformation of the impacting point for all the types of honeycomb core designs. The impactor recoiled very minimally for square core design and there was no recoil for the hexagonal and circular core. Kevlar/epoxy face sheet showed maximum displacement of the impacting point and strain energy absorption for the circular core.

The experiments were conducted on two different structures of aluminum-tube honeycomb core, square structure and star structure. The specimens were tested in order to find energy absorption, specific energy absorption, and crashworthiness behaviors. The results revealed that circular honeycomb cores with star structure could resist higher impact load than circular honeycomb cores with square structure. In addition, the larger tubes showed a lower impact load the smaller tubes. It was also revealed that the greater the collapse distance of the aluminum-tube honeycomb core, the lower the load. Moreover, FEA simulation results, through ABAQUS.CAE, were compared to the experimental results. The results revealed that good agreement was achieved between the experimental results and the FEA results. The comparison results showed that the difference in maximum load between experimental and FEA model was 0.47-11.84%, which is a reliable analysis result.

The quasi-static collapse response of the DHH is analyzed by a two-scale research method, and combined with momentum conservation law, the study is extended to dynamic collapse response.

The dynamic behaviors and energy-Absorbing characteristics of the MGHs under in-plane impact loadings were investigated by using explicit dynamic finite element (FE) simulation. This paper mainly focused on the effects of multi-layered gradient arrangements and impact velocities on the dynamic Poisson's ratios, dynamic plateau stresses, crushing load uniformities and specific energy absorption of the MGHs. A semi-empirical formula for the plateau stresses of the MGHs was presented. It was shown that through the proper choice of multi-layered arrangements, the MGHs can effectively improve the dynamic crushing behaviors and control energy absorption capacities.

A crash box filled with negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb based on horn structure was designed by extracting its excellent structural characteristics of impact resistance. The axial deformation modes and energy absorption characteristics of bionic crash box are investigated by means of finite element method, and compared with square crash box, diagonal crash box and side-to-side crash box. Under axial impact, the horn-bionic crash box shows significantly better load-carrying and energy-absorbing capacity than the square crash box and the diagonal crash box. On this basis, the thickness parameters, multi-objective optimization design and structure improvement design of horn-bionic crash box are studied successively in this work. The results show that the improved bionic crash box based on horn structure has a typical progressive shrinkage deformation mode. Its SEA reaches 29.9 kJ/kg, which is 2.5 times that of the square crash box, and its PCF is also greatly reduced from 542.4 kN to 391.1 kN. Therefore, the methods of structural improvement such as pre-deformed treatment, constraint beam adjustment and shortening the NPR core can effectively reduce the PCF of the crash box, and improve its energy absorption capacity, so as to obtain better comprehensive crashworthiness. Introducing the key characteristics of the horn structure into the design of the car crash box can effectively improve structural crashworthiness and provide new design guidance for the other energy-absorption components of vehicle. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cattle horn; crash box; crashworthiness; negative Poisson's ratio (NPR); Structural bionics","Accidents; Crashworthiness; Deformation; Energy absorption; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Structural optimization; Axial deformations; Cattle horn; Crash box; Crashworthiness designs; Deformation modes; Horn structures; Negative Poisson ratio; Structural bionic; Structural characteristics; Bionics","Lee, Se-jung, Design flow for the crash box in a vehicle to maximize energy absorption, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 227, 2, pp. 179-200, (2013); Abdullah, N.

First, a finite element model of the sandwich panel was established, and an impact load was applied. The numerical results were compared with theoretical and experimental results to verify the model's effectiveness. Second, the energy absorption efficiency and overall deformation of sandwich panels, sandwich cylindrical shells, and sandwich shallow shells under the same impact load were studied. The research shows that the energy absorption performance of the sandwich shells is better than that of the sandwich panels, and the overall deformation is less than that of the sandwich panels. The effect of increasing panel thickness on the two types of sandwich shell studies is based on this basis. The conclusions describe that increasing the panel thickness will significantly reduce the structure's energy absorption efficiency and deformation. Finally, the effect of single-and double-layer structure on the impact resistance of sandwich shells was studied when the total thickness of the sandwich structure was unchanged.

In this research a design of sandwich panel construction with a lattice structure core is evaluated as the battery protection system. Additive manufacturing technology advancements have paved the way for lattice structure development. The sandwich protective structure designs are evaluated computationally using a non-linear dynamic finite element analysis for various geometry and material parameters. The lattice structure’s optimum shape was obtained based on the highest Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) parameter developed using the ANOVA and Taguchi robust design method. It is found that the octet-cross lattice structure with 40% relative density provided the best performance in terms of absorbing impact energy. Furthermore, the sandwich panel construction with two layers of lattice structure core performed very well in protecting the lithium-ion NCA battery in the ground impact loading conditions, which the impactor velocity is 42 m/s, representing vehicle velocity in highway, and weigh 0.77 kg.

The drop-weight impact tests on the SESCS sandwich panels were conducted to obtain their failure modes, impact force and displacement responses. The effects of concrete core thickness, steel plate thickness, presence of stiffeners, and drop height on the dynamic responses of SESCS sandwich panels were experimentally revealed. All the tested panels exhibited the combined failure mode of global flexure and local indentation, and the SESCS sandwich panel demonstrated improved impact resistance. As compared to the SCS sandwich panel without stiffeners, the peak impact force and post-peak mean force of the SESCS sandwich panel were enhanced by 41.56% and 31.7%, respectively, while the maximum displacement was reduced by 30.21%. In addition, the impact resistance of the SESCS sandwich panel was found to be improved by increasing the thickness of steel plate and concrete core. The Finite Element (FE) models of the SESCS sandwich panels under impact loading were developed and validated with the experimental results. The FE analyses were subsequently conducted to reveal the damage evolution of concrete core during impact, and the concrete core exhibited punching shear failure at the impact zone and flexural failure at the free side of the panel, respectively.

Polymer-based AM processes, such as fused filament fabrication (FFF), permit rapid, low-cost fabrication of periodic structures from a wide range of materials. However, the mechanical properties of polymers are strongly affected by temperature, especially near the glass transition temperature (T<inf>g</inf>), which has a significant impact on the design and application of the structures. Herein, we utilize a coupled experimental and computational approach to evaluate the mechanical behavior of polymeric periodic structures (PPS) with uniform and spatially varying temperatures that span T<inf>g</inf>. Individual unit cells (square, auxetic, and honeycomb) are additively manufactured from polylactic acid (PLA) (T<inf>g</inf> = 54 °C) and experimentally evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) using a tension test fixture and thermal chamber. The unit cells are subjected to sequential tension and compression tests, up to a maximum of +/−20% strain, which are repeated from 40 °C to 65 °C in 5 °C increments. Maximum forces vary by two orders of magnitude when temperature varies across T<inf>g</inf>, and a hysteresis loop is observed for temperatures 14 °C below T<inf>g</inf>. This indicates that viscoelasticity has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of the structure below T<inf>g</inf> and that the structures are capable of dissipating energy. Experimental force-displacement and energy dissipation results agree favorably with results from a multiphysics finite element framework, which utilizes bulk material properties as inputs. The computational framework is then applied to structures comprising tessellated unit cells to evaluate the effects of uniform temperatures and temperature gradients on mechanical properties. The results demonstrate that non-uniform temperature fields can produce spatial variation of mechanical properties, such as Poisson's ratio, throughout the structure. Insight obtained in this investigation provides guidelines for the design, fabrication, and implementation of PPS operating across a range of temperatures that passively modifies their mechanical properties and energy dissipation characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Metamaterial; Multiphysics finite element modeling; Periodic structure; Polymer","3D printers; Additives; Biomechanics; Compression testing; Energy dissipation; Fabrication; Glass transition; Metamaterials; Structural properties; Temperature; Tensile testing; Additive manufacturing process; Glass transition temperature Tg; Low cost fabrication; Mechanical properties of polymers; Multi-physics; Multiphysic finite element modeling; Polymer based; Repeat units; Thermo-mechanical behaviors; Unit cells; Finite element method","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Yu, Xianglong, Mechanical metamaterials associated with stiffness, rigidity and compressibility: A brief review, Progress in Materials Science, 94, pp. 114-173, (2018); Hou, Xiuhui, Dynamic Crushing Strength Analysis of Auxetic Honeycombs, Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, 29, 5, pp. 490-501, (2016); Ling, Chen, Mechanical behaviour of additively-manufactured polymeric octet-truss lattice structures under quasi-static and dynamic compressive loading, Materials and Design, 162, pp. 106-118, (2019); Yazdani Sarvestani, Hamidreza, 3D printed meta-sandwich structures: Failure mechanism, energy absorption and multi-hit capability, Materials and Design, 160, pp. 179-193, (2018); Wang, Qiming, Lightweight Mechanical Metamaterials with Tunable Negative Thermal Expansion, Physical Review Letters, 117, 17, (2016); Lin, Kaijie, Metallic integrated thermal protection structures inspired by the Norway spruce stem: Design, numerical simulation and selective laser melting fabrication, Optics and Laser Technology, 115, pp. 9-19, (2019); Toropova, Marina M., Adaptive bimaterial lattices to mitigate thermal expansion mismatch stresses in satellite structures, Acta Astronautica, 113, pp. 132-141, (2015); Harkati, El Haddi, In-plane elasticity of a multi re-entrant auxetic honeycomb, Composite Structures, 180, pp. 130-139, (2017); Sun, Yongtao, Elastic and transport properties of the tailorable multifunctional hierarchical honeycombs, Composite Structures, 107, pp. 698-710, (2014)",""

The mechanical behaviour of these structures has been examined under both quasi-static and dynamic impact loading. Pre-buckled circular honeycombs with aspect ratios e = 0.8 and e = 0.6 were compared to a traditional, straight-walled honeycomb. It has been found that the mechanical behaviour of the honeycomb can be tailored to yield different mechanical responses. Principally, decreasing the aspect ratio reduced the stress at yield, as well as the total energy absorbed until densification, however, this alleviated the characteristic stress-softening response of traditional honeycombs under static and dynamic conditions. When subjected to multiple cycles of loading, a stabilised response was observed. The numerical response closely agreed with the experimental results. A simplified, periodic boundary condition model also closely agreed with the experimental results whilst alleviating computational run time by nominally 75%. The numerical full factorial parameter design sweep identified a broad range of mechanical behaviour.

Inspired by the micro wavy structure of the woodpecker beak, a novel bionic sinusoidal honeycomb is proposed and its crashworthiness performance is analyzed. Results show that the bionic sinusoidal honeycomb produces more folds than the conventional honeycomb under the same mass conditions, which greatly improves the energy absorption effect. Compared with the conventional honeycomb, although the initial peak crushing force of bionic sinusoidal honeycomb is generally higher (the change ranges from −1.64% to 11.84%), the specific energy absorption of all bionic sinusoidal honeycombs is much better (the increase ranges from 30.12% to 80.99%). Moreover, the bionic sinusoidal honeycomb has a better crush force efficiency when the amplitude is small. A comprehensive comparison of the impact resistance of the bionic sinusoidal honeycomb and conventional honeycomb shows that the proposed bionic sinusoidal honeycomb has better energy absorption and application scalability than the conventional honeycomb. Highlights A novel bionic sinusoidal honeycomb (BSH) is proposed based on woodpecker beaks The impact resistance of BSH is systematically studied using finite element analysis. Its specific energy absorption (SEA) can increase by 80.99% compared to conventional honeycomb. The SEA of BSH increases as the wall thickness increases, but it is weakly related to the amplitude and the wavenumber. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","bionic design; energy absorption; Out-of-plane crushing; parametric analysis; sinusoidal honeycomb","Bionics; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Honeycomb structures; Bionic design; Energy absorbing structure; Impact analysis; Out-of-plane; Out-of-plane crushing; Parametric analysis; Sinusoidal honeycomb; Special energy; Specific energy absorption; Wavy structures; Energy absorption","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Qin, Ruixian, Crashworthiness Design and Multiobjective Optimization for Hexagon Honeycomb Structure with Functionally Graded Thickness, Advances in Materials Science and Engineering, 2019, (2019); Xiao, Dengbao, Insight into the negative Poisson's ratio effect of metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb under dynamic compression, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 763, (2019); Wang, Huan, A novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced in-plane impact resistance, Composite Structures, 208, pp. 758-770, (2019); Wang, Huan, In-plane dynamic crushing behaviors of a novel auxetic honeycomb with two plateau stress regions, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 151, pp. 746-759, (2019); Zhang, Dahai, In–plane dynamic crushing behavior and energy absorption of honeycombs with a novel type of multi-cells, Thin-Walled Structures, 117, pp. 199-210, (2017); Gao, Dianwei, Theoretical and numerical investigation on in-plane impact performance of chiral honeycomb core structure, Journal of Structural Integrity and Maintenance, 3, 2, pp. 95-105, (2018); Zheng, Binbin, An auxetic honeycomb structure with series-connected parallograms, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 161-162, (2019); Tao, Yong, Mechanical properties and energy absorption of 3D printed square hierarchical honeycombs under in-plane axial compression, Composites Part B: Engineering, 176, (2019); Sun, Deqiang, The in-plane crashworthiness of multi-layer regularly arranged circular honeycombs, Science Progress, 103, 1, (2020)",""

Agglomerated cork was selected as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional synthetic polymeric foams. A nonlinear/explicit finite element model was implemented to study the problem. Continuous damage models were used to predict the intra-laminar and inter-laminar damage evolution in the face-sheets. The core behaviour was modelled through a hyperelastic elastomeric foam model with multiaxial failure criteria. The numerical model was validated in two phases. First, the numerical models of face-sheet and core were validated with experimental data from the open literature. Second, the precision of the model of the complete sandwich is assessed with experimental tests carried out in this work. Two cases were studied one when the projectile does not perforate the front face-sheet and another when the projectile does not perforate the back face-sheet. Results show that the numerical model accurately predicts transverse displacements when compared to DIC measurements. Additionally, the model can predict the panel's penetration when comparing with real specimens. Finally, the model provides the damage evolution and the evolution of the different energy absorption mechanisms during the perforation process, something that is not possible to obtain experimentally and provides a valuable tool to understand the phenomenon. © 2021","Carbon fibre; Continuum damage model; Finite element analysis (FEA); Impact behaviour; Numerical analysis; Sandwich panel","Agglomeration; Carbon fibers; Coremaking; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Numerical models; Projectiles; Carbon-epoxy; Continuum damage model; Damage evolution; Face sheets; Finite element analyse; Impact behavior; Impact loads; Sandwich panel; Work study; Sandwich structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); US Dep Transp Fed Aviaition Adm, (1999); McGowan, David M., Damage characteristics and residual strength of composite sandwich panels impacted with and without a compression loading, Collection of Technical Papers - AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, 1, pp. 713-723, (1998); Impact Engineering of Composite Structures, (2011); Sun, Guangyong, High-velocity impact behaviour of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels with different structural configurations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 122, pp. 119-136, (2018); Kolopp, Amélie, Experimental study of sandwich structures as armour against medium-velocity impacts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 61, pp. 24-35, (2013); Supian, A.

In this paper, the finite element models of four typical cellular structures (hexagon honeycomb, re-entrant hexagon honeycomb, star-shape honeycomb, double arrow honeycomb) are established and experimentally validated. The dynamic responses of four structures under different impact angles (from 0 to 30°) and impact velocities (from 5 to 50 m/s) are investigated. On this basis, the influences of impact angle and impact velocity on the specific energy absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) of four structures are discussed. The results reveal that the negative Poisson’s ratio structure has the advantage of energy absorption under axial impact due to the characteristics of compression and contraction at the low impact velocity. The hexagonal honeycomb structure has great advantages in terms of comprehensive energy absorption capacity and better stability at varying inclination angles. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with the ideal point method (IPM) is utilised to explore the optimal design of hexagon honeycomb structure, which is then verified by a detailed crashworthiness comparison with the original design.

All the tested FS-C-CS sandwich panels exhibited combination of local indention and global flexural deformation mode. Three stages of impact process were identified based on the characteristics of impact force and displacement response histories. In addition, the Finite Element (FE) model of the FS-C-CS panel under impact load was established, and the failure modes and impact energy dissipation performances of the FS-C-CS panels were obtained. The results showed that the concrete core dissipated the majority of impact energy, followed by corrugated plate and flat plate. Furthermore, the impact resistant performance of the FS-C-CS panel was found to be improved as compared to the traditional SCS sandwich panel with two flat faceplates in terms of smaller deformation as well as larger impact force and post-peak mean force. Moreover, the effects of corrugated steel plate height and steel plate thickness on impact responses of the FS-C-CS panels were analyzed. The results indicated that increasing corrugated plate height could reduce the maximum deformation of the FS-C-CS panel. Increasing corrugated plate thickness resulted in the reduction of maximum deformation, but increase of maximum impact force and post-peak mean force. The FE parametric studies also showed that decreasing the spacings of shear connectors as well as increasing the compressive strength of concrete and employing end plates led to improved impact resistance of the FS-C-CS panel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Composite panel; Drop-weight impact test; Finite element simulation; Impact response; Steel-concrete-steel panel","Compressive strength; Concretes; Deformation; Drops; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Sandwich structures; Composite panels; Corrugated plate; Corrugated steel; Drop-weight impact test; Finite elements simulation; Impact force; Impact response; Sandwich panel; Steel plates; Steel-concrete-steel panel; Finite element method","Zhu, Hua, Dynamic response of a novel laminated glass panel using a transparent glass fiber-reinforced composite interlayer under blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 89, pp. 14-24, (2016); Mehreganian, Navid, Plastic dynamic response of simply supported thick square plates subject to localised blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 126, pp. 85-100, (2019); Micallef, Karl, The dynamic performance of simply-supported rigid-plastic circular steel plates subjected to localised blast loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 65, 1, pp. 177-191, (2012); Li, Zhan, Experimental and numerical study on CFRP strip strengthened clay brick masonry walls subjected to vented gas explosions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 129, pp. 66-79, (2019); Sohel, Kazi Md Abu, Behavior and design of reinforced concrete building columns subjected to low-velocity car impact, Structures, 26, pp. 601-616, (2020); Do, Tinvan, Impact force profile and failure classification of reinforced concrete bridge columns against vehicle impact, Engineering Structures, 183, pp. 443-458, (2019); Ning, Jianguo, Failure analysis of reinforced concrete slab under impact loading using a novel numerical method, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 144, (2020); Xu, Xiangzhao, Failure analytical model of reinforced concrete slab under impact loading, Construction and Building Materials, 223, pp. 679-691, (2019); Oucif, Chahmi H., Damage modeling of ballistic penetration and impact behavior of concrete panel under low and high velocities, Defence Technology, 17, 1, pp. 202-211, (2021); undefined",""

This study focuses on the mechanical behaviour of through-thickness polymer, pin-reinforced foam core sandwich panels subjected to indentation and low impact loading. Experimental and computational approaches are used to study the global and internal behaviour of the sandwich panel. The samples for experimental testing were made from glass/polyester laminates as the face sheets and polyurethane foam as the foam core. To further reinforce the samples against bending, different sizes of polymeric pins were implemented on the sandwich panels. The sandwich panel was fabricated using the vacuum infusion process. Using the experimental data, a finite element model of the sample was generated in LS-DYNA software, and the effect of pin size and loading rate were examined. Results of the simulation were validated through a proper prediction compared to the test data. The results of the study show that using polymeric pins, the flexural strength of the panel significantly increased under impact loading. In addition, the impact resistance of the pin-reinforced foam core panel increased up to 20%. Moreover, the size of pins has a significant influence on the flexural behaviour while the sample was under a moderate strain rate. To design an optimum pin-reinforced sandwich panel a “design of experiment model” was generated to predict energy absorption and the maximum peak load of proposed sandwich panels. The best design of the panel is recommended with 1.8 mm face sheet thickness and 5 mm pins diameter. © 2021 by the authors.

An analytical model is built to investigate the in-plane crushing responses of the newly proposed honeycomb, which is in good agreement with the simulation and experimental results. The in-plane quasi-static compression characteristics and energy absorption capabilities of CVH are investigated systematically by finite element method and are compared with that of HH and other hierarchical honeycombs. Two plateau stress regions in the stress–strain curves of CVH are found under the quasi-static compression, and the second plateau stress is over three times higher than the first one. In order to understand the strengthening mechanism clearly, stable unicellular deformation and global modes are revealed. Two typical plateau stress are deduced theoretically based on the collapse modes to achieve performance prediction, which are respectively decided by the hexagonal structures located on both sides and the six vertexes of the representative unit cell. The results show that CVH can absorb much more energy than HH and the vertex-based hierarchical structure with the same masses under quasi-static compression. Furthermore, a parametric study is performed to explore the influence of the impact velocity, the order number, and the wall thickness on the plateau stress, specific energy absorption, and collapse deformation modes of CVH. It can be concluded that CVH is a better choice for energy absorption. The present study provides significant suggestions and guidance for the design-oriented multi-stage energy absorbing reinforced honeycomb structure with special functions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compression characteristics; Crashworthiness; Energy-absorption; In-plane crushing; Self-similar hierarchical honeycomb","Crashworthiness; Crushing; Deformation; Energy absorption; Structural design; Compression characteristics; Compressive behavior; Energy; Energy absorption capacity; Hexagonal honeycomb; In-plane crushing; Plateau stress; Quasi-static compression; Self-similar; Self-similar hierarchical honeycomb; Honeycomb structures","Qi, Chang, Quasi-static crushing behavior of novel re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 197, (2020); Sun, Yongle, Dynamic compressive behaviour of cellular materials: A review of phenomenon, mechanism and modelling, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 112, pp. 74-115, (2018); Wang, Huan, In-plane dynamic crushing behaviors of a novel auxetic honeycomb with two plateau stress regions, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 151, pp. 746-759, (2019); Peng, Xianglong, A novel hybrid-honeycomb structure: Enhanced stiffness, tunable auxeticity and negative thermal expansion, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 190, (2021); Zhang, Yanqin, Dynamic impact response of aluminum honeycombs filled with Expanded Polypropylene foam, Composites Part B: Engineering, 156, pp. 17-27, (2019); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing strength of hexagonal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 467-474, (2010); Sun, Guangyong, A two-stage multi-fidelity optimization procedure for honeycomb-type cellular materials, Computational Materials Science, 49, 3, pp. 500-511, (2010); Ma, Fangwu, Crashworthiness Optimization Design of Thin-Walled Tube Filled with Re-entrant Triangles Honeycombs, Automotive Innovation, 2, 1, pp. 1-13, (2019); Ma, Fangwu, Effects of Cell Microtopology on the In-plane Dynamic Crushing Analysis of Re-entrant Square Cellular Material, Automotive Innovation, 1, 1, pp. 24-34, (2018); Li, Zhen, Design-oriented crushing analysis of hexagonal honeycomb core under in-plane compression, Composite Structures, 187, pp. 429-438, (2018)",""

In this paper, the dynamic crushing properties and energy absorption capacities of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs with different topologies were explored by means of explicit dynamic finite element (FE) analysis using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Four types of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs with uniform cell-wall thickness were firstly constructed by substituting each vertex of regular honeycombs with a smaller self-similar cell (hexagon or square). The respective influences of hierarchical parameters and impact velocities on in-plane dynamic deformation modes, mechanical characteristic and energy absorption of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs were discussed. Research results showed that the hierarchy had a far greater influence on the in-plane deformation modes of honeycombs. Compared with regular honeycombs, the dynamic plateau stress and specific energy absorption of joint-based hierarchical honeycombs can be improved if the proper hierarchical parameters were chosen. Adding the joint-based hierarchy into regular honeycombs can enhance the crushing stress efficiency (CSE) of the specimens. In addition, by introducing a non-dimensional dynamic sensitivity index, the dynamic shock enhancement of hierarchical honeycombs was also investigated. These researches are useful for the multi-objective dynamic optimization design and controllable properties of cellular materials. © The Author(s) 2021.","energy absorption; Hierarchical honeycombs; in-plane crushing; joint-based; plateau stress","Crushing; Deformation; Energy absorption; Topology; Dynamic deformation mode; Dynamic optimization design; Dynamic plateau stress; Energy absorption capacity; Explicit dynamic finite element; In-plane dynamic crushing; Mechanical characteristics; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Sun, Yongle, Dynamic compressive behaviour of cellular materials: A review of phenomenon, mechanism and modelling, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 112, pp. 74-115, (2018); Zhu, Feng, Analytical investigation and optimal design of sandwich panels subjected to shock loading, Materials and Design, 30, 1, pp. 91-100, (2009); Chen, Liming, Numerical study on the projectile impact resistance of multi-layer sandwich panels with cellular cores, Latin American Journal of Solids and Structures, 13, 15, pp. 2576-2595, (2016); Pattofatto, Stéphane, Shock enhancement of cellular structures under impact loading: Part II analysis, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2672-2686, (2007); Qiu, Xinming, Collapse of periodic planar lattices under uniaxial compression, part II: Dynamic crushing based on finite element simulation, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 10-11, pp. 1231-1241, (2009); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing strength of hexagonal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 5, pp. 467-474, (2010); Mukhopadhyay, T., Effective in-plane elastic moduli of quasi-random spatially irregular hexagonal lattices, International Journal of Engineering Science, 119, pp. 142-179, (2017); Mukhopadhyay, T., Equivalent in-plane elastic properties of irregular honeycombs: An analytical approach, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 91, pp. 169-184, (2016); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003)",""

However, it is challenging due to diverse cell features, hybrid component materials, as well as varied types of impact load. In this study, two dimensionless indexes (i.e., horizontal dent offset displacement per unit depth ϕ and the ratio of horizontal to vertical energy absorption η) are proposed for sandwich structures based on the mechanical response characteristics (deformation and energy absorption) of sandwich structures under low-speed oblique impact. Unlike conventional crashworthiness indexes such as dent depth, specific energy absorption, damage area, etc., the proposed indexes take into account the influence of impact angle (θ) on the mechanical behavior of sandwich structures. Multiple sets of simulation of honeycomb sandwich structures, including conventional hexagonal honeycombs, honeycomb-filled structures and negative Poisson's ratio structures, obliquely impacted (θ varies from 15° ~ 75°) by a rigid body are performed by using the finite element method, whereby the crashworthiness index values of all the sandwich structures are obtained. The index values (ϕ and η) become smaller as the crashworthiness is enhanced (where the wall thickness of the sandwich structure is thickened from 0.02 ~ 0.1 mm). It manifests that the proposed indexes can capture the crashworthiness of sandwich structures under low-speed oblique impact reasonably well. In addition, the proposed indexes can more clearly distinguish the crashworthiness of sandwich structures of different configurations than conventional indexes. The index values (ϕ and η) show that the oblique crashworthiness of the negative Poisson's ratio structure, hexagonal honeycomb, and honeycomb-filled structure becomes stronger in order. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness; Dimensionless index; Oblique impact; Sandwich structure","Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid materials; Poisson ratio; Cell features; Dimensionless index; Energy; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Index values; Low speed; Negative Poisson ratio; Oblique impact; Ratio structures; Sandwich structures","Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Shifa, Madni, Mechanical and electrical properties of hybrid honeycomb sandwich structure for spacecraft structural applications, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 1, pp. 222-240, (2021); Crupi, Vincenzo, Comparison of aluminium sandwiches for lightweight ship structures: Honeycomb vs. foam, Marine Structures, 30, pp. 74-96, (2013); Kim, Jung-seok, Manufacturing and structural safety evaluation of a composite train carbody, Composite Structures, 78, 4, pp. 468-476, (2007); Zinno, Alberto, Multiscale approach for the design of composite sandwich structures for train application, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2208-2219, (2010); Amraei, Mohsen, Application of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panel as an energy absorber of high-speed train nose, Journal of Composite Materials, 48, 9, pp. 1027-1037, (2014); Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids: Structure and properties, second edition, pp. 1-510, (2014); Wang, Zhonggang, Recent advances in novel metallic honeycomb structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 166, pp. 731-741, (2019); Chai, Gin Boay, A review of low-velocity impact on sandwich structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 225, 4, pp. 207-230, (2011); Zhang, Dahai, Drop-weight impact behavior of honeycomb sandwich panels under a spherical impactor, Composite Structures, 168, pp. 633-645, (2017)",""

However, there is a lack of scientific information regarding how the material arrangement within the mouthguard can modify its mechanical response during an impact. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of material arrangement within custom-made mouthguards on stress transmitted to anterior teeth, bone, and soft tissue after impact. Four 3D finite element models of a human maxilla were reconstructed based on the CBCT of a young patient and analyzed according to the presence or absence of a mouthguard and the type of material arrangement within those with a mouthguard: model NMG with no mouthguard; model CMG representing the conventional arrangement with a single 4 mm-thick ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) foil; model FMG presenting layer arrangement with two 1 mm-thick foils of EVA in the outer shell and one 2 mm-thick foil of EVA foam in the core; model HMG presenting a 1 mm-thick compact inner and outer shell of EVA and a 2 mm wide air-filled zone in the core. Linear quasi-static analysis and frontal load were used to simulate an impact with an energy of 4.4 J. Isotropic linear elastic properties were assumed for the bone and teeth but not for the mouthguard protection and oral soft tissues. The results were evaluated and compared in terms of displacement, stretches, and stresses. All the mouthguards analyzed reduced the risk of injury to teeth and bone, reducing the displacement and stress of these structures. However, the implementation of a honeycomb struc-tured layer allowed more significant displacement and deformation of the mouthguard's external layer, thus promoting higher protection of the anatomic structures, namely the root dentin and the bone tissue. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that improving the mouthguard flexibility might increase the soft tissue injuries. © 2021 by the authors.

Because of these advantages of inner fibrous structure of elytron, the bionic investigation of beetle elytron has gradually become one of the research focuses in civil engineering and automobile anti-collision fields. In the present work, the honeycomb and tubes composed of fiber in the beetle elytra was analyzed, and a variety of bionic thin-walled honeycomb structures with curved hollow tubes were designed and modeled. The energy absorption ability of the bionic honeycomb structures with different types of tubes under impact loading were calculated by finite element software. The internal energy values and collapse processes of bionic structures were compared and analyzed at different crushing displacements. The parameter study, including wall thickness and impact angle, was carried out in the collapse time range from 0 ms to 8 ms. These results could be applied in developing crush-resistant materials in the field of automotive passive safety. © IMechE 2021.","elytra; energy-absorbing device; Honeycomb structure; numerical simulation; thin-walled tube","Biomechanics; Collision avoidance; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Thin walled structures; Absorption characteristics; Biological structures; Energy absorption ability; Engineered structures; Finite element software; High-strength fibers; Lightweight protective structures; Protection function; Bionics","Ge, Chengqiang, Theoretical prediction and numerical analysis for axial crushing behaviour of elliptical aluminium foam-filled tube, Thin-Walled Structures, 149, (2020); Dȩbski, Hubert, Stability and load-carrying capacity of thin-walled FRP composite Z-profiles under eccentric compression, Materials, 13, 13, (2020); Rezvani, Mohammad Javad, Effects of triggering and polyurethane foam on energy absorption of thin-walled circular tubes under the inversion process, Journal of Energy Storage, 27, (2020); Song, Jiafeng, Design and numerical study on bionic columns with grooves under lateral impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); Reddy, T.

Conventional homogeneous MS designed based on unit cells is not a globally optimal structure due to the incompatible with the variable stress field under the applied load. In contrast, naturally evolved heterogeneous MS such as bones and bamboos are perfectly adaptive to their applied loads and exhibit excellent structural efficiency. Therefore, a heterogeneous MS design method of 2D geometry based on force-flow for high mechanical properties is proposed. The generation methods of two characterization forms of force-flow, principal stress lines and load paths, force-flow guided heterogeneous MS generation method, and MS volume fraction control method are detailed. Force-flow is generated using interpolation method based on the stress information extracted from finite element analysis (FEA) results. Then, force-flow is used as a guide to generate heterogeneous MS highly coordinated with the stress field. Customization of heterogeneous MS volume fraction is achieved by regulating the sparsity of force-flow lines based on the number of seed points in the design domain. Finite element simulations and mechanical tests of different specimens demonstrate that force-flow based heterogeneous MS has higher strength and stiffness compared to homogeneous honeycomb MS and grid MS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Force-flow; Heterogeneous; Load paths; Mesoscale structure; Principal stress lines","Design; Finite element method; Structural optimization; Volume fraction; Applied loads; Forces flow; Generation method; Heterogeneous; High mechanical properties; Load paths; Mesoscale structure; Principal stress line; Stress field; Structure design; Stresses","Yang, Sheng, A new part consolidation method to embrace the design freedom of additive manufacturing, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 20, pp. 444-449, (2015); Levy, Asaf, Additive manufacturing of complex-shaped graded TiC/steel composites, Materials and Design, 118, pp. 198-203, (2017); Zhang, Haoqi, Performance-driven 3D printing of continuous curved carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites: A preliminary numerical study, Composites Part B: Engineering, 151, pp. 256-264, (2018); Fazelpour, Mohammad, A Unit Cell Design Guideline Development Method for Meso-Scaled Periodic Cellular Material Structures, Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology, 141, 4, (2019); Tang, Yunlong, Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) based design method for lattice structure to be fabricated by additive manufacturing, CAD Computer Aided Design, 69, pp. 91-101, (2015); Wang, Xue, Natural frequency optimization of 3D printed variable-density honeycomb structure via a homogenization-based approach, Additive Manufacturing, 20, pp. 189-198, (2018); Seharing, Asliah, A review on integration of lightweight gradient lattice structures in additive manufacturing parts, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 12, 6, (2020); Schaedler, Tobias A., Architected Cellular Materials, Annual Review of Materials Research, 46, pp. 187-210, (2016); Zhang, Pu, Efficient design-optimization of variable-density hexagonal cellular structure by additive manufacturing: Theory and validation, Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, 137, 2, (2015); Garcia, David, Mesoscale design of heterogeneous material systems in multi-material additive manufacturing, Journal of Materials Research, 33, 1, pp. 58-67, (2018)",""

The low-velocity impact response of the origami-inspired honeycomb sandwich was investigated experimentally and numerically. And the numerical prediction closely matched the experimental results in terms of contact-force histories and permanent deformations of sandwich plates.

However, there is limited published research concerning the development of general-purpose dynamic models mimicking the impact behavior of lattice configurations made from polymeric materials. As such, the main focus of this research is to develop efficient computational finite element models simulating the dynamic impact behavior of various lattice configurations embedded in sandwich panels that are made from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) material. In this case, the sandwich panel consists of a 3D-printed polymer lattice core covered with the skin of a Kevlar sheet. Four designs with different configurations of lattice structures were investigated experimentally in previous studies. The first configuration was the basic body centered cubic (BCC) with unit cell dimensions of 5 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm, and a strut diameter of 1 mm. The second configuration was produced by adding the vertical struts at alternative nodes layer by layer, referred to as BCCA. The third configuration was created by adding the struts with uniform gradient distributions, termed as BCCG. The last configuration was designed by adding vertical struts at all nodes on the BCC configuration, denoted as BCCV. In this research, the FEA software ABAQUS Explicit was used to model all four configurations under low-velocity impact loads. Then, the results from the FEA modeling of the four different sandwich structures were compared with the experimental observations. Significantly, the good agreement in the results between the FEA and the experimental work reveals the capability of the developed models to capture the dynamic impact behavior of various lattice configurations and is considered the main contribution of the current research. In addition, in situ deformation along with failure mechanisms, detailed information, visualization, and sufficient data of the lattice impact test has been obtained through the developed models. This in turn leads to saving human time and effort, providing better realization and deep analysis of impact deformation behavior reducing the size of the experimental work and the expenses associated with it. © 2021, ASM International.","3D printing; failure mechanisms; finite element modeling; in situ depth; lattice structures; low-velocity impact","ABAQUS; Data visualization; Deformation; Dynamics; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Polymers; Sandwich structures; Struts; Styrene; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Body-centered cubic; Computational approach; Lattice configuration; Low velocity impact; Low velocity impact behaviors; Mechanical characteristics; Unit-cell dimensions; 3D printers","Al Rifaie, Mohammed, Drop-Weight Impact Behavior of Three-Dimensional Printed Polymer Lattice Structures with Spatially Distributed Vertical Struts, Journal of Dynamic Behavior of Materials, 5, 4, pp. 387-395, (2019); Jefferson Andrew, Jefferson, Energy absorption characteristics of additively manufactured plate-lattices under low- velocity impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 149, (2021); Guessasma, Sofiane, On the mechanical behaviour of biosourced cellular polymer manufactured using fused deposition modelling, Polymers, 12, 11, pp. 1-15, (2020); Harris, J.

First, five materials with different cell thickness/cell size ratios (t<inf>0</inf>/a) were designed, and compression tests were performed under quasi-static conditions. The results show that the initial peak stress and the plateau stress both increase with the increase of the t<inf>0</inf>/a ratio. The plateau zone determines the energy absorption performance; therefore, this study focuses on the analysis of the mechanical properties of the plateau stage. Furthermore, through the compression theory, the energy dissipation process of the unit cell was evaluated, and the mean stress equation was obtained; the theoretically obtained plateau stress was similar to the test plateau stress. Moreover, the ideal constitutive relationship of the material based on the t<inf>0</inf>/a ratio under static load was derived. Finite element analysis was used for simulation. The stress-strain results of the test and the simulation were close. Furthermore, the structural parameters were optimized via multiobjective optimization.

By establishing the in-plane impact finite element model, the deformation modes and in-plane dynamic responses of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb structures under different impact velocities are detailed studied. And the geometric parameters (e.g., the amplitude and period) of the sinusoidal curve that affect the energy absorption performance of the structure are analyzed. Combining the optimal latin hypercube design method with the double-points infilling criterion, the high-precision adaptive Kriging models of the peak crush force (PCF) and the specific energy absorption (SEA) with respect to the amplitude and period are constructed. And then, a multi-objective crashworthiness optimization is carried out by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The Pareto optimal solution set is gained and the final compromise solution is then obtained based on the fitness function. The optimized results show the PCF of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb structure decreases by 30.53%, while the SEA increases by 38.55%. It indicates that the optimized sinusoidal honeycomb structure has better energy absorption performance than the conventional concave hexagonal honeycomb.

In this study, the volume, in-plane elastic modulus and unit cell area of the double V-wing honeycomb were analytically derived, which became parts of the theoretical basis of the novel equivalent method. Based on mass, plateau load, in-plane elastic modulus, compression strain and energy absorption of the double V-wing honeycomb, a novel equivalent method mapping relationship between the thickness–width ratio and the basic parameters was established. The various size factor of the equivalent honeycomb model was denoted as n and constructed by the explicit finite element analysis method. The mechanical properties and energy absorption performance for equivalent honeycombs were investigated and compared with hexagonal honeycombs under dynamic impact. Numerical results showed a well coincidence for each honeycomb under dynamic impact before 0.009 s. Honeycombs with the same thickness–width ratio had similar mechanical properties and energy absorption characteristics. The equivalent method was verified by theoretical analysis, finite element analysis and experimental testing. Equivalent honeycombs exceeded the initial honeycomb in performance efficiency. Improvement of performance and weight loss reached 173.9% and 13.3% to the initial honeycomb. The double V-wing honeycomb possessed stronger impact resistance and better load-bearing capacity than the hexagonal honeycomb under impact in this study. The equivalent method could be applied to select the optimum honeycomb based on requirements and improve the efficiency of the double V-wing honeycomb. © The Author(s) 2021.","Double V-wing honeycomb; dynamic impact; equivalent method; finite element analysis; negative Poisson’s ratio","Dynamics; Elastic moduli; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Absorption characteristics; Absorption performance; Experimental testing; Explicit finite element analysis; Hexagonal honeycomb; Load-bearing capacity; Mapping relationships; Performance efficiency; Honeycomb structures","Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Mohsenizadeh, Saeid, Crashworthiness assessment of auxetic foam-filled tube under quasi-static axial loading, Materials and Design, 88, pp. 258-268, (2015); Lakes, Roderic S., Advances in negative poisson's ratio materials, Advanced Materials, 5, 4, pp. 293-296, (1993); Howell, Barbara F., Examination of acoustic behavior of negative poisson's ratio materials, Applied Acoustics, 43, 2, pp. 141-148, (1994); Salit, Victor, On the feasibility of introducing auxetic behavior into thin-walled structures, Acta Materialia, 57, 1, pp. 125-135, (2009); Alderson, Kim Lesley, The strain dependent indentation resilience of auxetic microporous polyethylene, Journal of Materials Science, 35, 16, pp. 4039-4047, (2000); Prawoto, Yunan, Seeing auxetic materials from the mechanics point of view: A structural review on the negative Poisson's ratio, Computational Materials Science, 58, pp. 140-153, (2012); Budarapu, Pattabhi Ramaiah, Design concepts of an aircraft wing: composite and morphing airfoil with auxetic structures, Frontiers of Structural and Civil Engineering, 10, 4, pp. 394-408, (2016); Martin, Jamie, The hexachiral prismatic wingbox concept, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 245, 3, pp. 570-577, (2008); Wang, Chunyan, Multi-objective explosion-proof performance optimization of a novel vehicle door with negative Poisson’s ratio structure, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 58, 4, pp. 1805-1822, (2018)",""

A statistical design is carried out to evaluate the effect of the bamboo diameter (Ø20 and Ø30 mm) and the adhesive type (epoxy and biopolymer) on the maximum load, energy to maximum load, total deflection and total energy of the panels, which are assessed through graphical and failure analysis. A non-linear finite element (FE) analysis is developed to simulate the low-velocity impact test and to predict the failure mechanisms of the skins, bamboo core and adhesive. The experimental results show that, unlike the adhesive type, the bamboo diameter variation does not significantly affect the impact properties. Sandwich panels made of epoxy adhesive exhibit greater rigidity and lower maximum load than those with biopolymer, resulting in premature core-face debonding. On the other hand, sandwich panels made with biopolymer have a greater capacity for absorbing energy and maintaining structural integrity. The numerical simulation indicates a good correlation with the experimental data for load–displacement impact curves, kinematic energy-time curves, perforation process and failure modes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bamboo core; Biopolymer; Energy absorption; Low-velocity impact; Sandwich panel","Adhesives; Bamboo; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Sandwich structures; Velocity; Aluminum skin; Bamboo core; Biopolymer; Energy; Epoxy; Low velocity impact; Low velocity impact test; Maximum load; Sandwich panel; Statistical design; Honeycomb structures","Huo, Xintao, On low-velocity impact response of foam-core sandwich panels, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 181, (2020); Chai, Gin Boay, A review of low-velocity impact on sandwich structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 225, 4, pp. 207-230, (2011); Klaus, M., Experimental and numerical investigations of residual strength after impact of sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 44, pp. 50-58, (2012); Mocian, Oana Alexandra, Low velocity failure and integrity assessment of foam core sandwich panels, Fracture and Structural Integrity, 13, 48, pp. 230-241, (2019); Feng, Dianshi, Damage prediction in composite sandwich panels subjected to low-velocity impact, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 52, pp. 12-22, (2013); Yellur, Manoja Rao, A low velocity impact study on press formed thermoplastic honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 225, (2019); Ivañez, Inés, High-velocity impact behaviour of damaged sandwich plates with agglomerated cork core, Composite Structures, 248, (2020); Siivola, Juho T., Evaluation of damage detectability in practical sandwich structure application conditions using distributed fiber optic sensor, Structural Health Monitoring, 15, 1, pp. 3-20, (2016); Jefferson Andrew, Jefferson, Parameters influencing the impact response of fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composite materials: A critical review, Composite Structures, 224, (2019); Aryal, Binod, Effects of impact energy, velocity, and impactor mass on the damage induced in composite laminates and sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 226, (2019)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Impact damage remains a major concern for all structural components; creating internal damage and reducing the structural strength of a structure. Very few multiple-mass impact studies have been done on the composite sandwich panel. In the present work, the formulation is based on the rst-order shear deformation theory which is used to develop the model. Impacts were done over the top of the face sheet with different velocities and impact masses. The numerical model is verified by that of the experimental literature. Good agreements in terms of contact-force histories and deformation of the sandwich panel are found. Once results are validated for a single impact, furthermore, the study has been extended to multi-mass impact analysis with varying velocities of the impactor. Comparisons of various parameters such as contact force, deformation, and von Mises stress results are reported. Also, comparisons of impact responses shown for a cylindrical sandwich panel with a flexible core were studied and reported. © 2021 Sharif University of Technology.

This work proposes a cellular structure, as called Bamboo Biomorphic Structure (BBS), which is a functionally graded honeycomb cellular structure inspired by the microstructure of bamboo and manufactured using fused filament fabrication (FFF). It is hypothesized that, by introducing bamboo biomorphic micro-unit cells, including a range of thickness step differences within an individual honeycomb unit cell, the successive stages of deformation of the honeycomb structure can be controlled, making the system absorb impact energy more efficiently. Characterization of the designed structures was conducted under in-plane quasi-static loading conditions, and then evaluated using a nonlinear finite element commercial code LS-DYNA. The proposed gradient BBS showed higher absorbed impact energies by four times compared with the conventional Honeycomb structure. The proposed parametric design would aid engineering design principles for the development of a novel biomorphic cellular structure, which has the potential for large-scale manufacturing of efficient energy-absorbing engineering structures. Such an energy-absorbing structure can help improve the lightweight structure design for various applications, including automobiles and aircrafts, while ensuring safety under impact load. © 2021","Additive manufacturing; Bamboo biomorphic structure; Biomimetics; Energy absorption; Functionally graded cellular structure; Honeycomb","Automobile manufacture; Bamboo; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Cells; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Cytology; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Bamboo biomorphic structure; Biomorphic; Cell walls; Cellular structure; Design and modeling; Distributed cell; Energy; Functionally graded cellular structure; Impact energy; Unit cells; 3D printers","Du Plessis, Anton, Beautiful and Functional: A Review of Biomimetic Design in Additive Manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, 27, pp. 408-427, (2019); Bhushan, Bharat, Biomimetics: Lessons from Nature - an overview, Philosophical transactions.

Impact tests were conducted at four different energies using a drop-weight impact facility, and the deformation and damage characteristics of the tested sandwich panels were analyzed by microscopic X-ray computed tomography. The experimental results revealed two distinct failure modes of sandwich panels: namely mode A, with localized damage in both facesheets and core, which is dominated by indentation; and mode B, which is characterized by global bending deflection of the facesheets and overall core crushing. It was found that a sandwich panel with thin facesheets and a high-density honeycomb core (e.g. with a small cell size and/or a thick cell wall) tended to fail in mode A, but core height did not influence the failure mechanism notably. Furthermore, finite element modeling was carried out to gain further understanding of the effects of these structural parameters. The perforation resistance and energy absorption capacity were significantly enhanced with increasing facesheet thickness. Whereas reducing the cell size and/or thickening the cell wall resulted in lower perforation resistance. When the total thickness of facesheets remained a constant, the impact behavior of the sandwich structure could be optimized by controlling the thickness ratio of the front to back facesheets. Finally, cost efficiency analysis was performed to achieve a rational design of the sandwich structure considering both the impact performance and cost. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cost efficiency analysis; Energy absorption; Finite element analysis; Honeycomb core; Impact behavior; Sandwich structure","Cells; Computerized tomography; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cytology; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Cell walls; Cell-size; Cost efficiency analysis; Energy; Facesheets; Finite elements analysis; Honeycomb core; Impact behavior; Sandwich panel; Structural parameter; Honeycomb structures","Zhang, Chao, Low-velocity impact response and compression after impact behavior of tubular composite sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 193, (2020); Li, Xiaolong, Flexural creep behavior of web reinforced GFRP-balsa sandwich beams: Experimental investigation and modeling, Composites Part B: Engineering, 196, (2020); Castanié, B., Discrete modeling of the crushing of nomex honeycomb core and application to impact and post-impact behavior of sandwich structures, Solid Mechanics and its Applications, 192, pp. 427-489, (2013); Wang, Hongxu, Experimental study of the medium velocity impact response of sandwich panels with different cores, Materials and Design, 99, pp. 68-82, (2016); Abrate, Serge, Localized impact on sandwich structures with laminated facings, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 50, 2, pp. 69-82, (1997); Akil, Hazizan Md., The low velocity impact response of an aluminium honeycomb sandwich structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 34, 8, pp. 679-687, (2003); Sun, Yongle, Dynamic compressive behaviour of cellular materials: A review of phenomenon, mechanism and modelling, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 112, pp. 74-115, (2018); Ha, Ngoc-san, Energy absorption of a bio-inspired honeycomb sandwich panel, Journal of Materials Science, 54, 8, pp. 6286-6300, (2019); Vaidya, Uday K., Impact response of laminated and sandwich composites, CISM International Centre for Mechanical Sciences, Courses and Lectures, 526, pp. 97-191, (2011); Nemat-Nasser, Siavouche C., Experimental investigation of energy-absorption characteristics of components of sandwich structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 34, 6, pp. 1119-1146, (2007)",""

Because it is known that mechanical forces can have long reaching effects on neural growth, we investigate here how contractions of the circular smooth muscle of the gut impact morphogenesis of the developing fetal ENS, in chicken and mouse embryos. We find that the number of enteric ganglia is fixed early in development and that subsequent ENS morphogenesis consists in the anisotropic expansion of a hexagonal honeycomb (chicken) or a square (mouse) lattice, without de-novo ganglion formation. We image the deformations of the ENS during spontaneous myogenic motility and show that circular smooth muscle contractile waves induce longitudinal strain on the ENS network; we rationalize this behavior by mechanical finite element modeling of the incompressible gut wall. We find that the longitudinal anisotropy of the ENS vanishes when contractile waves are suppressed in organ culture, showing that these contractile forces play a key role in sculpting the developing ENS. We conclude by summarizing different key events in the fetal development of the ENS and the role played by mechanics in the morphogenesis of this unique nerve network. © Copyright © 2021 Chevalier, Agbesi, Ammouche and Dufour.","biomechanics; chicken; embryo; intestine; motility; mouse; neurons; peristalsis","animal experiment; anisotropy; article; biomechanics; chicken; embryo; fetus; fetus development; finite element analysis; gastrointestinal tract; intestine innervation; male; morphogenesis; mouse; mouse embryo; nerve cell; nerve cell network; nonhuman; peristalsis; smooth muscle contraction","Anava, Sarit, The regulative role of neurite mechanical tension in network development, Biophysical Journal, 96, 4, pp. 1661-1670, (2009); Bray, Dennis, Mechanical tension produced by nerve cells in tissue culture, Journal of Cell Science, VOL.37, pp. 391-410, (1979); Breau, Marie Anne, Extrinsic mechanical forces mediate retrograde axon extension in a developing neuronal circuit, Nature Communications, 8, 1, (2017); Breau, Marie Anne, β1 integrins are required for the invasion of the caecum and proximal hindgut by enteric neural crest cells, Development (Cambridge), 136, 16, pp. 2791-2801, (2009); Butler Tjaden, Naomi E., The developmental etiology and pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease, Translational Research, 162, 1, pp. 1-15, (2013); Chevalier, Nicolas R., A neural crest cell isotropic-to-nematic phase transition in the developing mammalian gut, Communications Biology, 4, 1, (2021); Chevalier, Nicolas R., Embryogenesis of the peristaltic reflex, Journal of Physiology, 597, 10, pp. 2785-2801, (2019); Chevalier, Nicolas R., Emergence and development of gut motility in the chicken embryo, PLOS ONE, 12, 2, (2017); Cornelissen, Wim, Electrophysiology of porcine myenteric neurons revealed after vital staining of their cell bodies.

Sandwich panels have been manufactured with carbon/fiber epoxy composite face sheets, polyurethane rigid foam core or 3D printed PLA plastic cellular honeycombs head (hexagonal, re-entrant, hexachiral and arrowhead). The material properties of the constituents have been determined via tensile and compression tests. The cellular core topologies have the same wall thickness and number of cells (39x4, except for the hexachiral topology). A rigid striker with a hemispherical head tip is dropped on the specimens with a speed of 2.6 m/s. Explicit finite element (FE) models are validated by the experimental results. Parametric numerical analyses using the validated FE have been carried out with different impact energies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 76 J to identify the best core designs. The results show that non-auxetic cores could have advantages over the auxetic ones at small deformation (impact energy is equal to 10 J) thanks to the larger contact surface and higher thickness of the cellular structure. The auxetic core, however, provides greater impact resistance and energy absorption capability as the impact energy increases due to the larger densification and lower indentation during collapse. The arrowhead-based panels in particular possess 25%, 13% and 11% larger crash efficiency than the other samples for impacts with 50, 60 and 76 J. The hexachiral lattice provides the best performance at 10, 20 and 30 J, and also possesses advantages over the other cellular configurations (except for the arrowhead core) in the case of 40, 50, 60 and 76 J impact loading. As a result, the arrowhead and hexachiral configurations are those mostly recommended for applications involving impacts under large deformations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Double arrowhead; Hexachiral honeycombs; Impact resistance; Mechanical metamaterial; Polyurethane foam; Re-entrant; Sandwich panel","3D printers; Compression testing; Deformation; Impact resistance; Polyurethanes; Sandwich structures; Topology; Auxetics; Composite sandwich panels; Core structure; Double arrowhead; Hexachiral honeycomb; Impact energy; Mechanical metamaterial; Polyurethane Foam; Re-entrant; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Gustin, Jeremy, Low velocity impact of combination Kevlar/carbon fiber sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 69, 4, pp. 396-406, (2005); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Dynamic models for low-velocity impact damage of composites sandwich panels - Part A: Deformation, Composite Structures, 52, 3-4, pp. 335-351, (2001); Hosur, Mahesh V., Impact performance of nanophased foam core sandwich composites, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 498, 1-2, pp. 100-109, (2008); Caprino, Giancarlo, Impact and post-impact behavior of foam core sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 29, 1, pp. 47-55, (1994); Sharma, S.

This study aims to develop a methodology for the analysis of a novel motorcycle helmet based on coupled head-helmet modelling and the kinematic and biomechanical head injure criteria. A representative full-face motorcycle helmet finite element (FE) model was established and validated by the standard drop tests. The validated helmet model was coupled with two types of human head models to obtain the acceleration histories transmitted to the head (e.g. peak acceleration (A<inf>max</inf>) and Head Injury Criterion (HIC)) and the biomechanical responses of the head (e.g. intracranial pressure (ICP) and von Mises stress (σ<inf>v</inf>)) under external impact load. Analyses were further conducted to investigate the use of honeycomb filler in helmets to improve their protective performance. An optimization study was implemented to find the feasibly optimised geometries of honeycomb filler and densities of liner foam for the helmet, which can significantly enhance helmet's protection performance and reduce head injury from impact scenarios. In comparison with the head responses (A<inf>max</inf> = 215.1 g, HIC = 1985, ICP = 228.8 kPa and σ<inf>v</inf> = 33.6 kPa) in conventional helmet design, the protective performance of the optimum helmet is considerably improved with a large reduction of the head responses (A<inf>max</inf> = 137 g, HIC = 918, ICP = 146.9 kPa and σ<inf>v</inf> = 18.1 kPa), representing their respective reductions of 36.3%, 53.8%, 35.8%, and 46.1%.

Multi-stability is achieved through a morphological change of shape upon loading, and in doing so multi-stable structures undergo transitions from one equilibrium state to another. This paper investigates the structural performance of the negative stiffness honeycomb (NSH) metamaterials made of double curved beams which are emerging in various applications such as sensors, actuators, and lightweight impact protective structures with structural tunability and recoverability. An analytical treatment is pursued using the Euler-Lagrange theorem and the stability of the honeycomb has been studied. Based on a static analysis of the nonlinear elastic system, the developed tangent stiffness matrix and ensuing deformation curve were assessed through multiple phases of deformation. The closed-form solution was in good agreement with the numerical finite element (FE) model at different bistability ratios. It was shown that the bistability ratio had a pronounced effect on the overall response of the honeycomb and the desired negativity in the stiffness matrix could be achieved with high bistability ratios. © 2021 by ASME","Computational mechanics; Curved beam; Elasticity; Honeycomb structure; Mechanical metamaterial; Mechanical properties of materials; Negative stiffness; Snap-through buckling; Stress analysis; Structures","Deformation; Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Stiffness; Analytical treatment; Closed form solutions; Morphological changes; Multi stable structures; Negative poisson's ratios; Protective structures; Structural performance; Tangent stiffness matrix; Stiffness matrix","Daynes, Stephen, Bistable prestressed buckled laminates, Composites Science and Technology, 68, 15-16, pp. 3431-3437, (2008); Jeong, Hoonyeub, Multistable Thermal Actuators Via Multimaterial 4D Printing, Advanced Materials Technologies, 4, 3, (2019); Seffen, Keith A., Morphing' bistable orthotropic elliptical shallow shells, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 463, 2077, pp. 67-83, (2007); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Tancogne-Dejean, Thomas, Additively-manufactured metallic micro-lattice materials for high specific energy absorption under static and dynamic loading, Acta Materialia, 116, pp. 14-28, (2016); Cellular Solids, (1997); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing response of auxetic honeycombs under large deformation: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, Thin-Walled Structures, 131, pp. 373-384, (2018); Okumura, Dai, Post-buckling analysis of elastic honeycombs subject to in-plane biaxial compression, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, 13-14, pp. 3487-3503, (2002); Zheng, Zhijun, Dynamic crushing of 2D cellular structures: A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 650-664, (2005); Hu, Lingling, Effect of cell-wall angle on the in-plane crushing behaviour of hexagonal honeycombs, Materials and Design, 46, pp. 511-523, (2013)",""

Different methods have been proposed to improve the impact damage resistance of sandwich composites including the addition of nanoparticles to the matrix. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of adding nanostrength, a block copolymer that self-assembles in the nanoscale, to the epoxy matrix on the low-velocity impact behaviour of sandwich panels with Kevlar facesheets and Rohacell foam core. Most previous studies on low-velocity impact damage used experimental testing but a combination of improved constitutive modelling of constituents and decreased computational costs make it possible to utilise continuum modelling to numerically simulate impact response of sandwich composites for a much wider range of conditions. A numerical model was developed in explicit FE software LS-Dyna and a constitutive law based on continuum damage mechanics was used for the simulation of the composite facesheets with and without the nano-reinforcements. A crushable foam model was used for the Rohacell foam core. The LS-Dyna model was validated by comparing the force, displacement measurements and damage assessment from the simulation with experimental impact tests conducted using a drop tower. The FE model shows good comparison with the experiment and a macroscopic phenomenological model is capable of capturing the impact damage behaviour of the sandwich plates with nano-reinforcements. © The Author(s) 2019.","block copolymer; continuum damage mechanics; finite element analysis; low-velocity impact; nanoparticles; Sandwich","Block copolymers; Computer software; Continuum damage mechanics; Damage detection; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Nanoparticles; Numerical models; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Velocity; Foam core sandwich panels; Impact damage resistance; Lightweight structural materials; Low velocity impact; Low-velocity impact damage; Nano-reinforced composites; Phenomenological modeling; Sandwich; Foams","Ávila, Antônio Ferreira, Nano-structured sandwich composites response to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 92, 3, pp. 745-751, (2010); Garg, Amar C., Failure mechanisms in toughened epoxy resins-A review, Composites Science and Technology, 31, 3, pp. 179-223, (1988); Taraghi, Iman, Low-velocity impact response of woven Kevlar/epoxy laminated composites reinforced with multi-walled carbon nanotubes at ambient and low temperatures, Materials and Design, 53, pp. 152-158, (2014); Mahdi, Tanjheel Hassan, Low-velocity impact performance of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics modified with carbon nanotube, nanoclay and hybrid nanoparticles, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 36, 9, pp. 696-713, (2017); J Sandwich Struct Mater, (2017); Reis, Paulo Nobre Balbis, Impact response of Kevlar composites with nanoclay enhanced epoxy matrix, Composites Part B: Engineering, 46, pp. 7-14, (2013); Domun, Nadiim, Improving the fracture toughness and the strength of epoxy using nanomaterials-a review of the current status, Nanoscale, 7, 23, pp. 10294-10329, (2015); Barsotti, Robert J., Nanostrength® block copolymers for epoxy toughening, Annual Technical Conference - ANTEC, Conference Proceedings, 3, pp. 1337-1341, (2009); Denneulin, Sébastien, The influence of acrylate triblock copolymer embedded in matrix on composite structures' responses to low-velocity impacts, Composite Structures, 94, 4, pp. 1471-1481, (2012); Matadi Boumbimba, Rodrigue, Preparation and mechanical characterisation of laminate composites made of glass fibre/epoxy resin filled with tri bloc copolymers, Composite Structures, 116, 1, pp. 414-422, (2014)",""

The vibration characteristics (i.e., natural frequency and damping ratio) of the sandwich structure with a simply supported boundary condition were obtained. Finite element models for the sandwich panel with the honeycomb core were developed and analysed via Ansys software package. The experimental tests were conducted on sandwich specimens for the validity goal of the previous models created via the finite element analysis. Free vibration test was implemented by a specific equipment manufactured to this purpose like data acquisition, accelerometer sensor and impact hammer which are interfaced with LabVIEW software and PC computer. The obtained results showed a good agreement between the finite element model and the experimental one, where the error ratio did not exceed 12%. Numerical analysis included simulating of 20 cases that were carried out depending upon the design matrix established by Design of Experiment (DOE) software (Design Expert version 10) with the technique of Response Surface Methodology (RSM). This software was employed to study the effect of honeycomb parameters on the vibration characteristics for the sandwich panel. The honeycomb parameters were core high, cell size and cell wall thickness. RSM technique was used to model and optimize the natural frequency and damping ratio in terms of the honeycomb parameters.

However, they have not been exploited as a structural core because of damage tolerance and durability concerns. The major drawbacks of sandwich panels having PU foam core are their poor mechanical properties and vulnerability to marine environmental conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to contribute to enhancing both the mechanical properties and environmental durability of the traditional PU foam cored-sandwich panels through introducing a potentially suitable alternative. For this purpose, an innovative panel with a multilayered hybrid core consisting of agglomerate cork and PU foam was proposed which was orthogonally stiffened by a thin-walled lattice structure and sandwiched between two composite skins. To characterize the environmental durability and mechanical properties of this novel panel, a wide range of experimental tests including water immersion conditioning, three-point bending, edgewise and flatwise compression, quasi-static indentation, and high-velocity impact perforation were conducted. The sandwich specimens made of composite skins and PU foam core were also manufactured and tested for comparative purposes. Additionally, a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis was also carried out and the numerical results were compared with the experimental data. The principal findings were that the proposed structural modifications caused a significant enhancement in all the studied mechanical and durability properties of PU foam-cored sandwich panels. It was also found that the FE model could predict load-displacement behavior of the studied sandwich panels under a variety of experimental conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental durability; Finite element analysis; Mechanical properties; Multilayered hybrid cored-sandwich panel; Thin-walled lattice structure","Bending dies; Bending tests; Composite structures; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Marine applications; Sandwich structures; Structural design; Structural properties; Thin walled structures; Environmental conditions; Environmental durability; Experimental conditions; Load-displacement behavior; Mechanical and durability properties; Non-linear finite-element analysis; Quasi-static indentation; Structural modifications; Durability","Borsellino, Chiara, Effect of bonder at skin/core interface on the mechanical performances of sandwich structures used in Marine industry, Applied Composite Materials, 14, 5-6, pp. 307-323, (2007); Palomba, Giulia, Collapse modes of aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures under fatigue bending loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 145, (2019); Handbook of Sandwich Construction, (1997); Crupi, Vincenzo, Prediction model for the impact response of glass fibre reinforced aluminium foam sandwiches, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 77, pp. 97-107, (2015); Lanssens, Tine, Mechanical behavior of a glass fiber-reinforced polymer sandwich panel with through-thickness fiber insertions, Construction and Building Materials, 64, pp. 473-479, (2014); Wang, Lu, Mechanical performance of foam-filled lattice composite panels in four-point bending: Experimental investigation and analytical modeling, Composites Part B: Engineering, 67, pp. 270-279, (2014); Tao, Jie, Manufacturing and mechanical performances of a novel foam core sandwich-walled hollow column reinforced by stiffeners, Thin-Walled Structures, 139, pp. 1-8, (2019); Sayahlatifi, Saman, Experimental and numerical investigation of sandwich structures with balsa core and hybrid corrugated composite/balsa core under three-point bending using digital image correlation, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 1, pp. 94-131, (2021); Capacity and Lifetime of Foam Core Sandwich Structures, (1995); Ataş, Cesim, On the impact response of sandwich composites with cores of balsa wood and PVC foam, Composite Structures, 93, 1, pp. 40-48, (2010)",""

In this paper, four types of new gradient honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio are obtained, including angle gradient, thickness gradient and functional gradient, which are obtained by changing the geometric or physical parameters of cells. Methods: The dynamic responses of gradient auxetic honeycombs under different impact speeds are studied by ABAQUS display dynamic finite element method, and the deformation profiles of gradient honeycomb models are obtained. The nominal stress–strain curves and energy absorptions of the gradient auxetic honeycombs are studied, and the dynamic bearing capacity of the four kinds of gradient auxetic honeycombs is further analyzed. Results and Conclusion: The results obtained in this paper show that the thickness of cell walls has a great influence on the impact resistance and vibration energy absorption of honeycomb structures. As for gradient honeycombs, the angle gradient honeycomb is better than the other three types in energy absorption, and the functional gradient honeycomb containing ceramic is less deformed.

Regarding the effects of adjacent unit cells, a mechanics-based homogenization approach is put forward and employed to derive static mechanical properties including elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ROHs under axial loading. Based on above, the predominant compression failure mode is explored. Then, the static mechanical properties and finite element model of ROH are validated by experiment and demonstrate high accuracy. Subsequently, to obtain dynamic responses of the ROH under dynamic impact loading, the relations among dynamic plateau stress and quasi-static plateau stress, initial density, dense strain and impact velocities are established under the conditions of mass conservation and momentum theorem based on one-dimensional shock wave theory and ideal rigid-perfectly plastic material model. Besides, dynamic energy absorption models of the ROH under dynamic loading are acquired in consideration of the effects of impact velocities on dense strain, the results show that theoretical models agree quite well with simulation results. On this basis, the application of ROH on automotive energy absorber is studied with the purpose of acquiring superior energy absorption and satisfying lightweight requirements simultaneously. Based on the decoupling thought of stiffness and pedestrian protection, a new design method of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) hood with ROH is put forward in consideration of energy absorption and lightweight requirements. Of this, ROH is regarded as sandwich structure to meet the demands of energy absorption, CFRP plates are treated as outer and inner skins to satisfy the needs of stiffness. Firstly, multi-objective optimization models are set up under the constraints of reasonable structural parameters and negative Poisson's ratio. Then, the NSGA-Ⅱalgorithm is adopted to achieve the optimal Pareto fronts with the targets for maximum unit mass energy absorption and minimum density. Afterwards, the optimization on thicknesses of CFRP layers is carried out to achieve minimum mass under the constraint conditions that the static stiffness of CFRP hood is larger than that of steel hood. In addition, the layering sequence of inner and lower skins are also optimized. Finally, improved overall stiffness, optimized HIC values and similar lightweight space of CFRP hood with ROH are achieved in comparisons with CFRP hood without ROH. Compared with steel hood, the pedestrian protection performance of CFRP hood with ROH is greatly enhanced, 1st free mode increases by 33.9%, and torsional stiffness and bending stiffness increase by 23.1% and 30.8%, respectively. While the weight decreases by 40.1%. The results indicate that the CFRP hood with ROH presents outstanding advantages of pedestrian protection and lightweight design in terms of HIC and stiffness performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular structure; Homogenization theory; Lightweight design; Mechanical models; Negative Poisson's ratio; Pedestrian protection","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Energy absorption; Graphite fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid integrated circuits; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Shock waves; Stiffness; Stress analysis; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP); Dynamic energy absorption; Homogenization approach; Multi-objective optimization models; Negative poisson's ratios; One-dimensional shock wave theories; Quasi-static plateau stress; Static mechanical properties; Failure (mechanical)","Lira, C., A gradient cellular core for aeroengine fan blades based on auxetic configurations, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 22, 9, pp. 907-917, (2011); undefined, (2007); Scarpa, Fabrizio L., Dynamic properties of high structural integrity auxetic open cell foam, Smart Materials and Structures, 13, 1, pp. 49-56, (2004); Karnessis, Nicholas, Uniaxial and buckling mechanical response of auxetic cellular tubes, Smart Materials and Structures, 22, 8, (2013); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Alderson, Andrew, The in-plane linear elastic constants and out-of-plane bending of 3-coordinated ligament and cylinder-ligament honeycombs, Composites Science and Technology, 70, 7, pp. 1034-1041, (2010); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Miller, Wayne, Flatwise buckling optimization of hexachiral and tetrachiral honeycombs, Composites Science and Technology, 70, 7, pp. 1049-1056, (2010); Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Chen, Daiheng, Bending deformation of honeycomb consisting of regular hexagonal cells, Composite Structures, 93, 2, pp. 736-746, (2011)",""

Disposed bottle caps can be used to generate eco-friendly honeycomb cores, especially when combined with other eco-friendly components.

This study evaluates the use of flax fibre laminates as sustainable skins for sandwich panels made from upcycled bottle caps core. Metallic skin cases are also tested as a reference. The influence of the amount of adhesive used to produce the panels is also investigated in a 22 full factorial design, together with an independent test carried out on samples made from natural fibres. The characterisation against flexural and low-velocity dynamic loads indicates that the flax fibre skin leads to specific core shear and flexural moduli up to 19% higher than in aluminium-based panels. Unidirectional flax fibres, however, reduce the energy absorption during impact. Flexural properties show that the most efficient design involves the least adhesive amount.

By using the double-inclined walls replacing the horizontal walls of the star-shaped honeycomb (SSH), and introducing a thin-walled circle contacting with the four concave corners of the SSH, the star-circle honeycomb (SCH) is designed. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors was explored based on finite element method (FEM). There are three types of deformation modes observed with different impact velocity, including low-, medium- and high-velocity loading modes and the stress-strain curve exhibits two plateau stress stages. Based on the deformation characteristics of the representative unit, theoretical calculation models were established to estimate the plateau stress of the SCH under low- and high-velocity loading according the conservation of energy and the theoretical calculation was in keep well with the numerical simulation. A deformation modes map was summarized to investigate the effects of the impact velocity and the relative density on the deformation modes and the energy absorption capability and the dynamic Poisson's ratio were studied. The result shows that the SCH presents better energy absorption compared with SSH as well as retaining the negative Poisson's ratio property.

Generally, metal or FRP sheets are used as skin/face sheet and honeycomb, foam and balsa wood, etc. are used as core materials. The elastic properties of the honeycomb are the function of foil thickness and cell size. In the present study, the effect of parameters (Foil thickness and Cell size) of the honeycomb on the energy absorption capacity of the sandwich composite was investigated through experimental and numerical studies. Experiments were carried out on four sandwich composites having a variable combination of foil thickness, and cell size by using the Charpy ASTM E-23 machine. Further, numerical analyses were carried out using finite element (FE) software Abaqus. The experimental and numerical results were found to be in good agreement. The results show that energy absorption to mass ratio increases with the increase in foil thickness and with the decrease in cell size. For the improvement of energy absorption to mass ratio, the effect of change in the foil thickness is significant compared to that of change in cell size. Failure mechanism was discussed through numerical study. The impact force resisted by the sandwich composites was presented by using the impulse-momentum equation. © 2021, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources.

In this paper, three lattice structures including Kelvin, Rhombic dodecahedron, and truncated cuboctahedron with identical geometric dimensions in quasi-static and dynamic loadings were investigated to identify the proper lattice structure for impact resistance applications. This study consisted of two experimental and numerical sections. In the experimental section, the lattice structures were fabricated using the selective laser melting (SLM) method from the AISI 316L material. The dynamic tests of the lattice structures were performed by the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with a strain rate of 765 s−1. In the numerical section, the modeling was carried out by the finite element method (FEM) to predict the properties of the lattice structures. The results of the experimental tests showed that the selected lattice structures had a high strength to weight ratio and considerable impact resistance; so, they could be suitable for use in lightweight and impact-resistant structures. In addition, the modeling results revealed a good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, the specific absorbed energy of the Rhombic dodecahedron lattice structure in the quasi-static compression test and with the 50% strain was 7% and 15% higher than that of Kelvin and truncated cuboctahedron lattice structures, respectively. While, with evaluation of the dynamic results, the truncated cuboctahedron lattice structure had higher area under the specific stress-strain curve in comparison to the other two structures.

A composite honeycomb structure model was built by dividing a honeycomb model into sub-domains in-plane and filling these sub-domains with circular and square honeycombs. This paper mainly focuses on the effects of impact velocity, honeycomb microtopology types, and honeycomb microtopology-type distribution in sub-domains on the deformation mode, plateau stress, load uniformity, and energy absorption capacity of composite honeycomb structures. A semiempirical formula for the plateau stress of composite honeycomb structures is presented. The results show that the honeycomb microtopology-type distribution in sub-domains is an important factor affecting the mechanical properties of composite honeycomb structures. Compared to regular honeycombs, crosswise arranging sub-domains of honeycombs with different microstructure types is more favorable for the load uniformity of composite honeycomb structures, and more fully couple type I structure and type II structure, which provides complementary advantages. © 2021, ASM International.","composite honeycomb structures; distribution; dynamic crushing; finite element analysis; microstructure types","Honeycomb structures; Microstructure; Deformation modes; Energy absorption capacity; Impact velocities; In-plane dynamic crushing; In-plane impact behavior; Properties of composites; Semi-empirical formulas; Type II structures; Composite structures","Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids: Structure and properties, second edition, pp. 1-510, (2014); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Sun, Yongle, Dynamic compressive behaviour of cellular materials: A review of phenomenon, mechanism and modelling, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 112, pp. 74-115, (2018); Hanssen, Arve Grønsund, Static and dynamic crushing of circular aluminum extrusions with aluminum foam filler, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 24, 5, pp. 475-507, (2000); Zhang, Xiong, Numerical investigations on a new type of energy-absorbing structure based on free inversion of tubes, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 51, 1, pp. 64-76, (2009); Wu, Hexiang, In-plane crushing behavior and energy absorption design of composite honeycombs, Acta Mechanica Sinica/Lixue Xuebao, 34, 6, pp. 1108-1123, (2018); Cooper, Graham J., The role of stress waves in thoracic visceral injury from blast loading: Modification of stress transmission by foams and high-density materials, Journal of Biomechanics, 24, 5, pp. 273-285, (1991); Lopatnikov, Sergey L., Dynamics of metal foam deformation during Taylor cylinder-Hopkinson bar impact experiment, Composite Structures, 61, 1-2, pp. 61-71, (2003); Lopatnikov, Sergey L., High-velocity plate impact of metal foams, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 30, 4, pp. 421-445, (2004); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003)",""

Panels with different layouts of stainless steels between layers of upper skin were subjected to low-velocity impact tests with hemispherical steel impactor. The histories of energy absorption of reinforced and non-reinforced panels at the peak load of upper skin, and contact force and penetration of projectile during the impact test are obtained by experiment. Moreover, A Finite Element Analysis is performed using Abaqus/Explicit package. There is a good agreement between numerical and experimental results. The polyurethane foam core was modeled using VUMAT Subroutine and Ductile Criteria used for the evaluation of stainless steel wires. Besides, the impact behavior of these reinforced specimens compared by non-reinforced specimen, and “Star layout” specimen is observed to be more effective in enhancing the low-velocity impact behavior of sandwich panels compared with others. This layout can enhance the energy absorption of sandwich panels more than twice the non-reinforced samples by only adding 10% of the weight of pure specimens.

The equivalent elastic parameters of the functionally graded honeycomb core are given. Based on Reddy's higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) and Hamilton's principle, the governing partial differential equation of motion is derived under four simply supported boundary conditions.

Drivers must be assured that they can avoid these problematic conditions. According to the statistics, about 10,000 are dead, and more than a million people are wounded each year in India. Hence, improvement in the safety of vehicles is of utmost importance to shoot down the number of accidents. The automotive bumper beam is one of the essential components in passenger cars. Bumper beams reduce or minimize the extent of impact caused at the front and rear ends during a collision in passenger vehicles. It absorbs the impact energy. The important physical parameters in the bumper beams such as material, size, and design to improve the extent of crashworthiness are studied and discussed in this current work. Comparative analysis between 2 mm thickness and 4 mm thickness bumper with honeycomb structure is studied. An ideal design composition is considered.

The mechanical behavior of sandwich panels (glass fiber-reinforced polymer [GFRP] skin reinforced with lattice webs and syntactic foams core) is studied under crushing load. The crushing behavior, failure modes, and energy absorption are correlated with the number of GFRP layers in facesheets and webs, fiber volume fractions of facesheets in both longitudinal and transverse directions, and density and thickness of syntactic foam. The test results revealed that increasing the number of FRP layers of lattice webs was an effective way to enhance the energy absorption of sandwich panels without remarkable increase in the peak load. Moreover, a three-dimensional finite-element (FE) model was developed to simulate the mechanical behavior of the syntactic foam sandwich panels, and the numerical results were compared with the experimental results. Then, the verified FE model was applied to conduct extensive parametric studies. Finally, based on experimental and numerical results, the optimal design of syntactic foam sandwich structures as energy absorption members was obtained.

Inspired by the concept of variable cross-section design, a new auxetic re-entrant honeycomb structure is designed in this study. The detailed design method of re-entrant honeycomb with variable cross-section (VCRH) is provided, and five VCRH structures with the same relative density and different cross-section change rates are proposed. The in-plane impact resistance and energy absorption abilities of VCRH under constant velocity are investigated by ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. The results show that the introduction of variable cross-section design can effectively improve the impact resistance and energy absorption abilities of auxetic re-entrant honeycombs. The VCRH structure has better Young’s modulus, plateau stress, and specific energy absorption (SEA) than traditional re-entrant honeycomb (RH). The influence of microstructure parameters (such as cross-section change rate α) on the dynamic impact performance of VCRH is also studied. Results show that, with the increase in impact velocity and α, the plateau stress and SEA of VCRH increase. A positive correlation is also found between the energy absorption efficiency, impact load uniformity and α under both medium and high impact speeds.

In this paper, the dynamic mechanical behaviour and energy absorption characteristics of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels (AHSPs) under repeated impact loadings are investigated. A three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of AHSP under repeated impact loadings is established by using the commercial software ABAQUS Explicit. The accumulation processes of plastic deformation, the impact force-displacement curves as well as the energy absorption performances are numerically calculated. Besides, the repeated impact experiments of AHSPs were conducted by using the drop-weight impact testing machine INSTRON CEAST 9350. Furthermore, the influences of geometrical parameters on the dynamic behaviours of AHSPs under repeated impact loadings are further performed. Results show that the numerical calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. With the increase of the repeated impact numbers, the bending deflections of both top and bottom face sheets of AHPSs accumulate gradually, the compressive deformations of the honeycomb cores enlarge gradually and finally the densification phenomenon appears. The deformation mode of bottom face sheet experiences the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations. © 2020","Aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels; Dynamic mechanical behaviour; Energy absorption; Experimental validation; Repeated impacts","ABAQUS; Aluminum; Bending (forming); Dynamics; Energy absorption; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Offshore structures; Sandwich structures; Absorption characteristics; Absorption performance; Aluminium honeycomb; Commercial software; Compressive deformations; Drop-weight impact testing; Elastoplastic finite elements; Repeated impact load; Bending (deformation); bending; dynamic property; experimental study; loading; mechanical property; plastic deformation","Balcı, Onur, Experimental investigation of single and repeated impacts for repaired honeycomb sandwich structures, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 682, pp. 23-30, (2017); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Cai, Wei, Numerical simulations for plates under ice impact based on a concrete constitutive ice model, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 143, (2020); Chen, Ganchao, Experimental and numerical analyses on the dynamic response of aluminum foam core sandwich panels subjected to localized air blast loading, Marine Structures, 65, pp. 343-361, (2019); Cho, Sangrai, Repeated lateral impacts on steel beams at room and sub-zero temperatures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 72, pp. 75-84, (2014); Crupi, Vincenzo, Collapse modes in aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 6-15, (2012); Crupi, Vincenzo, Comparison of aluminium sandwiches for lightweight ship structures: Honeycomb vs. foam, Marine Structures, 30, pp. 74-96, (2013); Duan, Fangjuan, Dynamic behaviour of aluminium alloy plates with surface cracks subjected to repeated impacts, Ships and Offshore Structures, 14, 5, pp. 478-491, (2019); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Guo, Kailing, Experimental investigation on the dynamic behaviour of aluminum foam sandwich plate under repeated impacts, Composite Structures, 200, pp. 298-305, (2018)",""

The addition of tube filler made the Mises stress and deformation distribution of the front and back face-sheets more uniform.

Influences of geometric parameters of the novel sandwich core, such as thickness, height, and short span length were studied. Four different configurations of composite corrugated core sandwich structures were prepared and tested. The impact events were monitored using a high-speed camera and measured by an impact force transducer and accelerometer attached to the impactor. The results revealed that the increase of core thickness improved impact capacity while the increase of core height decreased sandwich strength by increasing elastic deformation. The damage status of the novel composite core sandwich was simulated and insight into the damage mechanism was gained with finite element analysis. This study proposes an improved numerical model by incorporating the effect of the impactor head which was able to predict the impact capacity to within 10% variation of the experimental results. The results also identified that the multi-cell composite corrugated core increased the impact capacity due to the continuity of the fibres between adjacent cells. Moreover, the trapezoidal composite corrugated sandwich core showed higher specific strength compared to traditional honeycomb, truss and foam cores. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Empirical prediction; Finite element modelling; Impact behaviour; Impact damage; Novel composite core","High speed cameras; Sandwich structures; Composite core; Composite corrugated cores; Continuous fibres; Damage mechanism; Impact behaviour; Impact capacity; Low velocity impact; Specific strength; Foams","Zangana, Sartip, A novel hybridised composite sandwich core with Glass, Kevlar and Zylon fibres – Investigation under low-velocity impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 137, (2020); McCracken, Aidan, Partial-composite behavior of sandwich beams composed of fiberglass facesheets and woven fabric core, Thin-Walled Structures, 131, pp. 805-815, (2018); Resende Oliveira, Pablo Resende, Sustainable sandwich composite structures made from aluminium sheets and disposed bottle caps, Thin-Walled Structures, 120, pp. 38-45, (2017); Liu, Chengjun, High velocity impact responses of sandwich panels with metal fibre laminate skins and aluminium foam core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 100, pp. 139-153, (2017); Boonkong, T., The low velocity impact response of curvilinear-core sandwich structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 93, pp. 28-38, (2016); Kılıçaslan, Cenk, Experimental and numerical studies on the quasi-static and dynamic crushing responses of multi-layer trapezoidal aluminum corrugated sandwiches, Thin-Walled Structures, 78, pp. 70-78, (2014); Kılıçaslan, Cenk, The impact responses and the finite element modeling of layered trapezoidal corrugated aluminum core and aluminum sheet interlayer sandwich structures, Materials and Design, 46, pp. 121-133, (2013); Zhang, Linhui, Dynamic response of corrugated sandwich steel plates with graded cores, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 65, pp. 185-194, (2014); undefined; Dharmasena, Kumar P., Dynamic response of a multilayer prismatic structure to impulsive loads incident from water, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 4, pp. 632-643, (2009)",""

A topology optimization technique based on the evolutionary structural optimization method and nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis with deflection and periodic constraints is used to generate optimal designs of sandwich panels under impact loads. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, design optimization of various sandwich panels is evaluated. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of unit cells, core height, stiffener configuration and impact load intensity on the optimal designs.

Efficient and reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems are required to provide a probabilistic interpretation of diagnostics. In this study, crack damage identification of a thick composite sandwich structure based on Gaussian Processes (GP) classification is reported by numerical simulations. The goal of the study is to obtain a data-driven probabilistic interpretation of damage detection. The investigation is carried out based on healthy and damaged status of a sandwich panel with a honeycomb core modelled in ANSYS. Instantaneous signals with different frequencies are applied to the structure and finite element analysis is performed to obtain vibration responses in both statuses. Features extracted by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used to train and test the GP model to assess the health status of the structure. Impacts of mother wavelet in DWT, likelihood function and inference method, as well as iteration numbers are investigated on the classification accuracy.

Different honeycomb core configurations and impact parameters were considered experimentally using a pendulum apparatus and numerically using dynamic finite element simulations. One retired aircraft panel that contained damage from in-service impacts was also considered. Destructive sectioning showed that the core damage depth was constant within each panel for different depths of surface dents, impact velocity, impactor radius and mass. The depth of the core damage was proven to be dependent only on the height of the adhesive fillet that joins the facesheet to the core. The width of the core damage was contained to a region directly below the surface dent in the facesheet.

To localize the low-frequency bandgaps, an analytical model based on Hamilton's principle and the energy averaging technique is developed and is confirmed by a three-dimensional numerical simulation. Moreover, the effective mass density is determined analytically to give a physical insight into the wave control mechanism. Then, the dynamic behavior of the finite structure is investigated analytically. A finite element (FE) simulation and experimental measurements are performed to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of this dynamic model. Results show that the proposed metastructure exhibits an excellent vibration suppression performance, as well as a significant tunability. Furthermore, to claim multifunctionality, the out-of-plane compression behavior is analyzed experimentally. Experimental results indicate that mechanical properties of the proposed metastructure are significantly improved in comparison with a traditional square honeycomb sandwich structure. The proposed strategy is a novel multi-functional combination, which can help realize vibration control and high mechanical efficiency. This will significantly impact multiple research areas in vibration analysis and provide engineering applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Lightweight high-strength structure; Local resonant metastructure; Multifunctional structure; Square honeycomb; Vibration suppression","Flight control systems; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Effective mass density; Engineering applications; Finite element simulations; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Mechanical efficiency; Out-of-plane compression; Three-dimensional numerical simulations; Vibration suppression; Vibration analysis","Wadley, Hayden N.G., Multifunctional periodic cellular metals, Philosophical transactions.

To limit the vast complexity of the problem, a purely vertical impact is considered as a reference scenario for an assembly made of a crashworthy helicopter seat and a subfloor section, including an anthropomorphic dummy. A preliminary lumped mass model is used to drive the design of the experimental drop test. Some additional static and dynamic tests are carried out at the coupon and sub-component levels to characterize the seat cushion, the seat pan and the honeycomb elements that were introduced in the structure as energy absorbers. The subfloor section is designed and manufactured with a simplified technique, yet representative of this structural component. Eventually, a finite element model representing the full drop test was created and, together with the original lumped mass model, finally validated against the experimental test, outlining the advantage of using both the numerical techniques for design assistance. © 2020 by the authors.

A theoretical model is proposed to estimate the dynamic crushing strength of non-auxetic honeycombs while including the effect of the entrapped gas on the crushing process. The theoretical predictions are shown to agree well with the finite element (FE) simulations. From the numerical simulations, Hugoniot relations between the shock velocity and the impact velocity are obtained for various honeycomb geometries. It has been observed that shock velocity varies almost linearly with impact velocity. Using this fundamental relation, we derive the stress-impact velocity Hugoniot from the conservation law of momentum. The dynamic stress-strain states of a regular hexagonal honeycomb obtained from the FE simulations show a good agreement with the Hugoniot predictions. It is shown that the dynamic stress-strain states for various impact velocities lie on a unique curve, which is different from the quasi-static stress-strain response. The local strains behind the shock front are significantly lowered in the presence of an entrapped gas, and the stresses behind the shock front are higher as compared to the case where there is no entrapped gas. The variation of the plateau stresses with the cell morphology has been explained, and correlated to the energy absorption capacity of the honeycombs. A new method to characterize the energy absorption capacity of honeycombs is proposed, and the performance of various honeycombs has been compared through the dissipation performance parameter. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic crushing strength; Dynamic stress-strain states; Entrapped gas; Honeycombs; Shock front","Crushing; Elasticity; Energy absorption; Gases; Honeycomb structures; Laws and legislation; Plastic deformation; Shock waves; Strain; Velocity; Dynamic stress strains; Energy absorption capacity; Finite element simulations; Hexagonal honeycomb; Performance parameters; Quasi-static stress; Theoretical modeling; Uniaxial dynamic compression; Stress-strain curves","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Tan, P.

Compared to the conventional honeycomb, a hierarchical honeycomb displays a higher mean post-yield crushing stress, although its specific energy absorption is slightly lower. Their initial phase of energy dissipation is linked to the rotation and shortening/compression of the inclined hierarchical walls. Due to less catastrophic collapse of the smaller first-order cells, the plateau stress phase is more stable and gradual overall hardening is evident in the stress-strain curve.

Because the absolute stiffness of the lightweight mirror is much lower than that of the solid one, the design of lateral support becomes more difficult. Based on parallel push-pull support, we have proposed a multi-class variable F−θ optimization approach (MVFOA), where F denotes the magnitude of the support force and θ denotes the support position. Compared with conventional optimization approaches, which only have one class of design variables, F or θ, MVFOA considers the impact of F and θ simultaneously. In addition, we also study push-pull-shear lateral support and propose an unequal-angle push-pull-shear support optimization approach (UPSOA). To verify the advancement of above approaches, by means of finite element calculation, the lateral support optimization of a 2.5 m ultra-low expansion honeycomb sandwich mirror is performed in this paper. For parallel push-pull support with 24 forces, three optimization approaches with different variables, including single-class variable F, single-class variable θ, and multi-class variable F−θ, are compared, and the RMSs of surface deformations are 17.60 nm, 15.93 nm, and 14.81 nm, respectively. For push-pull-shear support with 24 forces, the optimal result by UPSOA occurs when β equals to 0.84 and the RMS of surface deformations is 10.83 nm. UPSOA also solves the problem that the forces in the region x ≈ ±R are much larger than the ones in the region x ≈ 0 in the equal-angle push-pull-shear support optimization approach (EPSOA). Through the analysis of results, we find that optimal β of the honeycomb sandwich mirror is greater than that of the meniscus mirror in push-pull-shear support. In addition, both in parallel push-pull support and push-pull-shear support, it also can be concluded that the position and the magnitude of optimal lateral support forces depend on the stiffness distribution of the mirror along the altitude axis rather than the mass distribution. © 2020 Optical Society of America.","","Deformation; Honeycomb structures; Stiffness; Conventional optimization; Lightweight mirrors; Optimization approach; Optimization design; Space-based telescopes; Stiffness distributions; Support optimizations; Surface deformation; Mirrors; altitude; article; finite element analysis; knee meniscus; rigidity","Principles of Astronomical Telescope Design, (2025); Stepp, Larry M., Gemini primary mirror support system, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2199, pp. 223-238, (1994); Astronomical Optics and Elasticity Theory, (2009); West, Steven C., Progress at the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2871, pp. 74-85, (1997); Noethe, Lothar, Latest developments of active optics of the ESO NTT and the implications for the ESO VLT, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 1542, pp. 293-296, (1991); Mack, Brian, Deflection and stress analysis of a 4.2-m diam primary mirror of an altazimuth-mounted telescope, Applied Optics, 19, 6, pp. 1000-1011, (1980); Flébus, Carlo, Opto-mechanical design of the 3,6 m Optical Telescope for ARIES, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7012, (2008); Cho, Myung-kyu, Optimization of the ATST primary mirror support system, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6273 I, (2006); Cho, Myung-kyu, Effect of Gemini primary mirror position, relative to the lateral support, on mirror figure, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4003, pp. 165-175, (2000); Gong, Xuefei, Research on mirror lateral support of large astronomical telescope, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6148, (2006)",""

Structural differences between collagen regions underlying the hexagonal scutes were observed with confocal microscopy and microcomputed tomography (μ-CT). μ-CT revealed a tapering of the mineral plate from the center of the scute to the interface between scutes, suggesting the structure allows for more flexibility at the interface. High-resolution μ-CT revealed, for the first time, a 3D image of the dermal armor's complex collagen structure. Helical interfibrillar gaps in the collagen base were found that are similar to the Bouligand-type structure of the lobster, Homarus americanus, thereby suggesting that the collagen in the boxfish is also of a Bouligand-type structure. In situ scanning electron microscopy tests were performed in shear and tension between two connected scutes and suggest that the interfacial collagen is structurally designed to preferentially absorb energy during deformation to protect the internal collagen. Similarly, in situ small-angle x-ray scattering was performed in shear and tension and further corroborated the complex collagen structure. Lastly, these experimental results are coupled with finite element simulations that characterize the interfacial collagen and corroborate the non-linear deformation response seen during in situ testing. Overall, these findings further the understanding of the structure and mechanics of the dermal armor of the boxfish which may help provide a basis to synthesize bioinspired composites for impact-resistant materials, specifically with bioinspired Bouligand-type structures to create novel fiber-reinforced composites. © 2020 The Authors.","Bouligand structure; Boxfish; Finite element analysis in situ small-angle x-ray scattering; Honeycomb structure","Armor; Collagen; Computerized tomography; Deformation; Fiber reinforced plastics; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray scattering; Collagen structure; Fiber reinforced composites; Finite element simulations; High resolution; Microcomputed tomography; Nonlinear deformations; Situ scanning electron microscopy; Structural differences; Composite structures","Naleway, Steven E., Structural Design Elements in Biological Materials: Application to Bioinspiration, Advanced Materials, 27, 37, pp. 5455-5476, (2015); Ann Sci Nat Zool Paris, (1995); Besseau, Laurence, The twisted collagen network of the box-fish scutes, Tissue and Cell, 30, 2, pp. 251-260, (1998); Yang, Wen, The armored carapace of the boxfish, Acta Biomaterialia, 23, pp. 1-10, (2015); Naleway, Steven E., Structure and mechanical properties of selected protective systems in marine organisms, Materials Science and Engineering C, 59, pp. 1143-1167, (2016); Yang, Wen, Natural flexible dermal armor, Advanced Materials, 25, 1, pp. 31-48, (2013); Zhu, Deju, Structure and mechanical performance of a ""modern"" fish scale, Advanced Engineering Materials, 14, 4, pp. B185-B194, (2012); Zhu, Deju, Puncture resistance of the scaled skin from striped bass: Collective mechanisms and inspiration for new flexible armor designs, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 24, pp. 30-40, (2013); Bruet, Benjamin J.F., Materials design principles of ancient fisharmour, Nature Materials, 7, 9, pp. 748-756, (2008); Song, Juha, Threat-protection mechanics of an armored fish, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 4, 5, pp. 699-712, (2011)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Yet, since transmission loss phenomena are usually governed by mass, their low weight renders composite sandwich panels potentially inefficient in terms of acoustic performance, a subject that has received little attention in the past. This paper presents experimental, numerical and analytical investigations about the acoustic performance of composite sandwich panels used in building construction. Standard airborne and impact sound transmission tests are performed on a full-scale composite sandwich panel, designed for structural application in building floors, and their acoustic performance is compared with the applicable code requirements. In the numerical study, a finite element model is developed to simulate the airborne sound transmission. The analytical study assesses the applicability of the reciprocity theorem to such panels. The obtained results confirmed the overall low acoustic performance of lightweight composite sandwich panel floors and pointed out the need for additional sound insulation measures. The numerical simulations presented good agreement with the experimental data, following the overall development of the experimental transmission loss curve, and predicting the dip associated with the coincidence effect. The application of the reciprocity theorem to the sandwich panel floors was validated with the experimental results and allowed for an accurate prediction of the impact sound pressure level based on the numerical results of the airborne sound reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic performance; Analytical modelling; Building floors; Composite sandwich panels; Experimental tests; Finite element analysis","Acoustic noise measurement; Acoustic wave transmission; Acoustic waves; Architectural acoustics; Floors; Sandwich structures; Sound insulation; Transmissions; Airborne sound transmissions; Analytical investigations; Analytical simulations; Composite sandwich panels; Environmental resistance; Impact sound pressure levels; Impact sound transmissions; Structural applications; Honeycomb structures","Lightweight Sandwich Construction, (2001); Handbook of Sandwich Construction, (1997); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Proceedings 19th Annual International Bridge Conference, (2002); 2004 Orthotropic Bridge Conference, (2004); Harris, Devin K., Field investigation of a sandwich plate system bridge deck, Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, 22, 5, pp. 305-315, (2008); undefined, (2009); undefined, (2011); Teixeira de Freitas, Sofia, Sandwich system for renovation of orthotropic steel bridge decks, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 13, 3, pp. 279-301, (2011); Ramôa Correia, João Ramôa, GFRP sandwich panels with PU foam and PP honeycomb cores for civil engineering structural applications: Effects of introducing strengthening ribs, International Journal of Structural Integrity, 3, 2, pp. 127-147, (2012)",""

In this study, the authors have suggested a novel protective mechanism (Metallic Foam Shell – MFS) by using a lightweight sandwich panel. At the first step, a preliminary study is conducted, followed up by the numerical simulations to determine the applicable materials. At the next step, experimental tests were performed to assess the efficiency of the suggested device against flying ballast impacts. An extended non-destructive (NDT) evaluation has been performed in order to find the most suitable technique for damage detection of the proposed device when on-service. The studied cases were GFRP and Aluminium sandwich panels, having an aluminium foam core with different densities and thicknesses. The results showed that the MFS can absorb up to 90% of the initial impact energy and significantly decrease the chance of rebounding impact to the other components.

To this end, a suitable material model for the aluminum honeycomb core is used taking the strain-rate dependent properties into account. To validate the ballistic impact of the projectile on the honeycomb core, numerical results are compared with the experimental results available in literature and ballistic limit velocities are predicted with good accuracy. Moreover, to achieve composite skin material model, a VUMAT subroutine including damage initiation based on Hashin’s seven failure criteria and damage evolution based on MLT approach modulus degradation is used. To validate the composite material model VUMAT subroutine, the ballistic limit velocities of the projectile impact on the composite laminates are predicted similar to the numerical results presented by other researchers. Next, the numerical model of the sandwich panel ballistic impact at different velocities is compared with the available experimental results in literature, and energy absorption capacity of the sandwich panel is predicted accurately. In addition, the numerical model simulated the sandwich panel damage mechanisms in different stages similar to empirical observations. Also, the composite skin damages are investigated based on different criteria damage contours. © The Author(s) 2018.","ballistic limit velocity; composite progressive damage model; finite element modeling; High velocity impact; sandwich panels","Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Laminated composites; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Strain rate; Structural panels; Velocity; Aluminum honeycomb cores; Ballistic limit velocity; Composite material models; Energy absorption capacity; High-velocity impact; Progressive damage; Sandwich panel; Strain-rate-dependent; Numerical models","Impact Engineering of Composite Structures, (2011); Chang, Foukuo, A Progressive Damage Model for Laminated Composites Containing Stress Concentrations, Journal of Composite Materials, 21, 9, pp. 834-855, (1987); Xin, Shihong, A progressive damage model for fiber reinforced plastic composites subjected to impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 40-52, (2015); undefined, (2014); Hashin, Zvi, Failure criteria for unidirectional fiber composites, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 47, 2, pp. 329-334, (1980); Hashin, Zvi, A Fatigue Failure Criterion for Fiber Reinforced Materials, Journal of Composite Materials, 7, 4, pp. 448-464, (1973); Lapczyk, Ireneusz, Progressive damage modeling in fiber-reinforced materials, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 38, 11, pp. 2333-2341, (2007); undefined, (2007); Matzenmiller, Anton, A constitutive model for anisotropic damage in fiber-composites, Mechanics of Materials, 20, 2, pp. 125-152, (1995); Deka, Lakshya J., Damage evolution and energy absorption of E-glass/polypropylene laminates subjected to ballistic impact, Journal of Materials Science, 43, 13, pp. 4399-4410, (2008)",""

The ballistic performance of each armor type was also investigated using three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) simulations. Upon validating the FE simulation results with experimental measurements, the ballistic limit velocity and failure mechanisms for each type of armor, as well as the influence of ceramic tile size, impact position, border effect, and inter tile gap width were quantified. For the enhanced mosaic armor, the metallic honeycomb lattice performed as a cellular skeleton to confine the ceramic tiles and fragments, leading to enhanced ballistic resistance. Besides, the honeycomb enhanced mosaic armor was also found to have much improved multi-hit ballistic resistance in comparison with monolithic and mosaic alumina. The honeycomb preserved the structural integrity of the mosaic armor so that a high level of residual ballistic resistance remained even after impact. With the extended reliability calculation method, single shot ballistic data were used to estimate the performance of the honeycomb enhanced mosaic armor under multiple projectile impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Ballistic limit; Honeycomb lattice; Mosaic armor; Multi-hit resistance; Penetration","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Projectiles; Aluminum honeycomb; Ballistic limit velocity; Ballistic performance; Ballistic resistance; Finite element simulations; Monolithic alumina; Reliability calculation; Threedimensional (3-d); Armor","Wilkins, Mark L., Mechanics of penetration and perforation, International Journal of Engineering Science, 16, 11, pp. 793-807, (1978); Sherman, Dov, Quasi-static impact damage in confined ceramic tiles, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 4, pp. 245-265, (1998); Hazell, Paul J., A note on the behind armour effects from perforated alumina/aluminium targets, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 7, pp. 589-595, (1998); Ni, Changye, Ballistic resistance of hybrid-cored sandwich plates: Numerical and experimental assessment, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 46, 1, pp. 69-79, (2013); Chi, Runqiang, Ballistic impact on bi-layer alumina/aluminium armor: A semi-analytical approach, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 52, pp. 37-46, (2013); Bouville, Florian, Strong, tough and stiff bioinspired ceramics from brittle constituents, Nature Materials, 13, 5, pp. 508-514, (2014); Liu, Z.

When compared with composite materials, hybrid materials consisting of separate metal and thermoplastic parts can be recycled more easily. In addition to their applications in civil engineering, the aluminum-low density polyethylene-aluminum (Al-LDPE-Al) sandwich panels yield a potential use as light ballistic protection material. In this study, a standard hybrid panel of 3.2 mm polyethylene filling and 0.4 mm of two aluminum metal sheets was experimentally tested under ballistic impact. A finite element model was constructed via commercial software and validated through shooting experiments with a rifle under real conditions. The finite element model was used to simulate the oblique impact behavior of Al-LDPE-Al sandwich panels as a single layer, as 5 layers stacking and as a single layer equivalent of the stacked 5 layer. Results showed that the oblique impact does not have a significant effect on the single layer panel. Stacked layers, however, and the equivalent single layer of a stacked layer have the highest energy absorption under a 30° hitting angle. © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co.

Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and compression experiments are adopted to characterize the mechanical properties including equivalent Young's modulus, equivalent Poisson's ratio, and quasi-static collapse process of 2D DVHs and DUHs. Specimens of the 2D DUHs and DVHs made of Aluminum alloy (A6061) are fabricated through wire cut electrical discharge machining. Both numerical and experimental results illustrate that concave DUHs exhibit tunable negative Poisson's ratio and equivalent stiffness level compared to DVHs. Furthermore, DUHs have smooth geometry configurations that can reduce stress concentration at elastic region and exhibit stronger auxetic behavior during large deformation. Those mechanical properties of 2D DUHs satisfy the requirements for practical engineering applications such as energy absorption. The dynamic crushing responses of 2D DVHs and DUHs are also investigated, and it is found that the crushing collapse modes and plateau stress improvement of 2D DUHs are related to the crushing velocity. Finally, the local impact responses of 2D DVHs and DUHs are studied numerically, the influences of impact velocity and indenter size are considered.

It also improves ability of materials to absorb impact energy as well as the overall stiffness of structures. In this research, authors examine synclastic panels made from novel wood-based composites. The aim is to determine the force–displacement characteristics during uniaxial compression and obtain the stiffness of the panels. These data allow one to predict the behavior of a panel during two-axial bending with different support scenarios. Finite element method (FEM) analysis is performed, with the use of model material, to determine the impact of varied facings thickness as well as different types of materials and core structures, on the stiffness of synclastic panels. It is demonstrated that proposed multilayer composites allow forming (technologically difficult) spherical shapes, without additional heat and pressure treatment. The type of an outer layer material strictly determines the usability and ease of two-axial bending process.

Auxetics, therefore, have the potential to enhance sporting protective equipment. Herein, finite element modeling, additive manufacturing and impact testing of three auxetic lattices, and a conventional equivalent, with a view to advance auxetic implementation within sports equipment, are explored. The lattices are modeled and impacts are simulated between 1 and 5 J, for flat and hemispherical drop hammers. Simulation outputs including peak impact force, impact duration, maximum axial strain, and Poisson's ratio are compared with experimental results from equivalent impact energies on additively manufactured lattices, using an instrumented drop tower and a high-speed camera. The simulation and experimental results show broad agreement for all lattices and scenarios, demonstrated by comparative force versus time plots and maximum compression images. The benefits of developing and validating finite element models of three auxetic lattices (and the conventional honeycomb lattice) under various impact scenarios, as a process, are discussed, including material characterization of an exemplar thermoplastic polyurethane.

Optimum values of the crashbox length, honeycomb wall angle and honeycomb wall thickness are obtained to maximize composite objective function that provides a compromise between these two metrics.

Several drop-weight dynamic impact tests were first conducted on both sandwich structures and their individual components to explore the mechanism of energy absorption and interactive effect between the foam core and facesheets. Different shapes and sizes of impactors were used in the experiments. The full-field deflection distribution was acquired by a 3D optical scanner to assess the failure patterns. A full-scale finite element model was then created to simulate the low-velocity impacting response of the foam-core sandwich panels. After the finite element model was validated against the experimental results, it was used to further explore the crash behavior of multi-layered sandwiches. It was found that multi-layer sandwich structure had much better performance in the crush force efficiency than those with single-layer foam core. Based upon the energy principle, an energy-based analytical model was also derived to estimate the initial peak load. It was demonstrated that the analytical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental and numerical results. The presented experimental, numerical and analytical studies are anticipated to provide systematic understanding and new knowledge for design of multilayer sandwich configurations aiming at more desirable impact resistance and better lightweight characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Failure mechanism; Impact resistance, Crashworthiness; Low-velocity impact; Multilayer foam sandwich","Crashworthiness; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Laser recording; Sandwich structures; Scanning; Analytical predictions; Analytical studies; Crush force efficiency; Foam core sandwich panels; Individual components; Interactive effect; Low velocity impact; Sandwich configuration; Structural design","Sun, Guangyong, Experimental study on the dynamic responses of foam sandwich panels with different facesheets and core gradients subjected to blast impulse, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 135, (2020); Wang, Erdong, Computational analysis and optimization of sandwich panels with homogeneous and graded foam cores for blast resistance, Thin-Walled Structures, 147, (2020); Triantafillou, Thanasis C., Failure mode maps for foam core sandwich beams, Materials Science and Engineering, 95, C, pp. 37-53, (1987); Petras, A., Failure mode maps for honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 44, 4, pp. 237-252, (1999); Banghai, Jiang, Failure mechanism of sandwich beams subjected to three-point bending, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 739-745, (2015); Yan, Leilei, Three-point bending of sandwich beams with aluminum foam-filled corrugated cores, Materials and Design, 60, pp. 510-519, (2014); Zhang, Jianxun, Low-velocity impact of sandwich beams with fibre-metal laminate face-sheets, Composites Science and Technology, 168, pp. 152-159, (2018); Production Engineering Research and Development, (2004); Ning, Haibin, Thermoplastic sandwich structure design and manufacturing for the body panel of mass transit vehicle, Composite Structures, 80, 1, pp. 82-91, (2007); Hudson, Craig W., Multiple objective optimisation of composite sandwich structures for rail vehicle floor panels, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2077-2082, (2010)",""

Moreover, the parametric study was performed through numerical simulations to study the influence of face sheet thickness (0.7, 1, 1.5 and 2 mm), cell wall thickness (0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09 mm) and cell size (3.2, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 mm) of the honeycomb core on the ballistic response and energy absorption. Against ogive nosed projectile, face sheets failed in radial stretching with petal formation and the core failed in crushing.

The current research mainly focuses on the wall with regular rectangular cross-section, but there has been little research on the blast load distribution of the honeycomb rigid wall subjected to blast wave. In this paper, a theoretical analysis has been carried out attempting to predict clearing blast load and reflected pressure distribution on honeycomb-section wall subjected to ground blast. Then, combined with LS/DYNA FEA method, a numerical simulation of blast load and shockwave propagation on honeycomb-section wall was carried out, and the blast experiment was conducted to verify the finite element model. The results indicated that the distribution of blast load on honeycomb wall presents a non-monotonic change along the length of the wall, and the incidence angle at blast surface of honeycomb wall periodically changes with the longitudinal direction of the wall, resulting in a sawtooth wave form of reflected pressure, and gradually decreasing with the increase of the distance between the measuring points along the wall length; The blast load predicting model of honeycomb established in this paper can reasonably reveal the overpressure distribution characteristics on blast wall of honeycomb-section rigid wall which has been verified by numerical simulation and blast experiment results.

In this study, honeycomb structure panel is expanded to cylindrical shell by adopting the rolled-up algorithm and the crushing behaviors of the randomly honeycomb cylindrical shell (RHCS) structures are investigated under axial loading. The influence of geometrical and topological parameters, i.e. the thickness-to-diameter ratio, cell irregularity, relative density on the deformation evolution and energy absorption performance is systematically performed. It is found that the deformation modes of RHCS structures are significantly affected by thickness-to-diameter ratio and cell irregularity. Moreover, the rate-independent, rigid–plastic hardening (R–PH) idealisation with two parameters is adopted to characterize the crushing responses of RHCS structures and the parameters are quantified as power-law relations with respect to relative density. Further, the crushing behaviors of density-graded RHCS structures with continuously varying in density are carried out under different impact velocities. Results indicated that the introduction of density gradients can strongly affect the deformation mode, crushing force and energy absorption performance of density-graded RHCS structures. Combining with analysis of crushing front propagation, the theoretical determination of crushing responses of the density-graded RHCS under different loading rates is presented based on R–PH model. The results of predicted crushing force-time histories of density-graded RHCS structures show versatile agreement with that of finite element values at both impact and support ends. Additionally, the energy absorption capacity that is related to deformation mechanisms of density-graded RHCS structures is investigated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crushing front; Deformation mechanism; Density-graded distribution; Energy absorption; Honeycomb cylindrical shell","Crushing; Cylinders (shapes); Deformation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Shells (structures); Absorption performance; Crushing behaviors; Cylindrical shell; Deformation mechanism; Energy absorption capacity; Graded distributions; Power law relation; Topological parameters; Rigid structures","Ebrahimi, Hamid, Honeycomb sandwich panels subjected to combined shock and projectile impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 95, pp. 1-11, (2016); Liu, Jiefu, Blast resistance and parametric study of sandwich structure consisting of honeycomb core filled with circular metallic tubes, Composites Part B: Engineering, 145, pp. 261-269, (2018); Zhai, Jiayue, Energy absorption of pre-folded honeycomb under in-plane dynamic loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 145, (2019); Zhang, Dahai, In–plane dynamic crushing behavior and energy absorption of honeycombs with a novel type of multi-cells, Thin-Walled Structures, 117, pp. 199-210, (2017); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Tejavibulya, Nalin, Directed self-assembly of large scaffold-free multi-cellular honeycomb structures, Biofabrication, 3, 3, (2011); Mei, Hong, Simulation of catalytic combustion of methane in a monolith honeycomb reactor, Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering, 14, 1, pp. 56-64, (2006); Wang, Zhonggang, High-speed axial impact of aluminum honeycomb - Experiments and simulations, Composites Part B: Engineering, 56, pp. 1-8, (2014); Zarei Mahmoudabadi, M., Experimental investigation on the energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb sandwich panels under quasi-static punch loading, Aerospace Science and Technology, 88, pp. 273-286, (2019); Palomba, Giulia, Collapse modes of aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures under fatigue bending loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 145, (2019)",""

The in-plane impact resistances and absorbed-energy characteristics of bio-inspired auxetic RAHs subjected to a constant velocity crushing are numerically studied by using ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. It is shown that due to the introduction of re-entrant arc-shaped structures, the dynamic response curves of bio-inspired RAHs have better crushing load uniformity than conventional re-entrant honeycombs. Except for the relative density and impact velocity, the dynamic crushing behaviors of bio-inspired RAHs also depend upon the cell micro-structure parameters (e.g., the curvature). Based on the one-dimensional (1D) shock theory and absorbed-energy efficiency method, an empirical equation is deduced to evaluate the dynamic plateau stress of bio-inspired RAHs. The finite element (FE) results coincide well with those calculated by the empirical formulas. Moreover, the specific energy absorption (SEA) and energy dissipation rules of bio-inspired RAHs are discussed, which are also dependent on the curvature.

Afterward, the prototype was created and tested on force acceptance using the methods of quasi-static test and impact test. The research result illustrates that all the tests-computer simulation, quasi-static test and impact test-are in agreement demonstrating that aluminium honeycomb is capable of absorbing energy within a designated condition of receiving force in the specified direction.

Drop-weight tests were conducted on sandwich panels with carbon/epoxy facesheets and a 10 mm thick PVC foam core. Three foam core densities (65, 100 and 160 kg/m3) and two facesheet layups ([0/90<inf>3</inf>/0], [0<inf>3</inf>/±45]<inf>S</inf>) were examined in the study. The analyses show that the influence of core density on the damage resistance of the panels is strongly correlated to the layup of the skin. While the damage developing in [0/90<inf>3</inf>/0] panels is not affected by core density, the damage area in [0<inf>3</inf>/±45]<inf>S</inf> panels reduces with increasing core density. The different influence of core properties on the damage response of [0/90<inf>3</inf>/0] and [0<inf>3</inf>/±45]<inf>S</inf> sandwich panels may be attributed to the different bending stiffness of the facesheets, with a response to impact dominated by global bending in panels with thin [0/90<inf>3</inf>/0] skins as opposed to one mainly governed by local shear rigidity in panels with thicker [0<inf>3</inf>/±45]<inf>S</inf> skins.

The damage modes were obtained through non-destruction inspection (NDI) C-scan and microscopic observation. A refined three-dimensional finite element model combined with continuum damage mechanics (CDM) was developed with composite plies and detailed honeycomb core. Physically-based Puck's composite failure criteria and energy based progressive damage model were used to capture the intralaminar damage initiation and evolution, respectively. The interlaminar damage of facesheet and debonding of facesheet/core interface were predicted using cohesive element. The hexagonal honeycomb cells were characterized in FE model with an elasto-plastic constitutive model and damage criterion in detail during impact. The simulation results show good agreements with experiments and the model can be used to predict the low-velocity impact response and impact damage effectively.

Although quasi-static or impact mechanical behaviors have been extensively studied, modal response of Miura-ori core sandwich structures has not been investigated yet. In this paper, carbon-fiber-reinforced Miura-ori core sandwich panels (MSPs) were fabricated with an autoclave processing method. Modal tests were carried out to investigate the structural vibration performances. A finite element analysis of MSPs was developed and validated with the tests results. Fiber orientation influences of both face sheets and core on the natural frequencies were investigated. Furthermore, a parametric study on the modal response of various MSPs models subjected to virtual free vibration was performed, through which the relationships between the fundamental frequencies and the geometric parameters were established. Compared with corrugated core sandwich panel under identical dimension and weight, MSP always possesses higher fundamental frequency, with an increase of 11.7% in the optimum case. It indicates that MSP is much stiffer and could be designed even lighter in aerospace applications. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon fiber; Miura-ori core; modal response; parametric study; sandwich structure","Aerospace applications; Carbon fibers; Fibers; Honeycomb structures; Industrial research; Natural frequencies; Reinforcement; Structural dynamics; Carbon fiber reinforced; Continuous manufacturing process; Fundamental frequencies; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Miura-ori core; Modal response; Parametric study; Structural vibrations; Sandwich structures","Buitrago, Brenda L., Modelling of composite sandwich structures with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2090-2096, (2010); Miller, Wayne, Honeycomb cores with enhanced buckling strength, Composite Structures, 93, 3, pp. 1072-1077, (2011); Wang, Zhonggang, Mechanical behaviors of inclined cell honeycomb structure subjected to compression, Composites Part B: Engineering, 110, pp. 307-314, (2017); Shafizadeh, J.

The reentrant honeycomb cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The deformation processes of honeycomb core were captured by a high-speed camera. And deflection history of back face sheet was obtained using three-dimensional digital imaging correlation method (DIC) analysis system. Failure modes and deformation mechanisms of the sandwich arch were investigated. According to experiment results, the local negative Poisson's ratio deformation was found in honeycomb core. Then, a finite element (FE) model was established to study the dynamic deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant honeycomb core. The results showed that the honeycomb cells were not always undergoing shrinkage deformation and flowing into the loading center, while the local expand deformations of honeycomb core were also found. © 2019","Auxetic reentrant honeycomb; Dynamic response; Impulsive loading; Negative Poisson's ratio; Shallow sandwich arch","Aluminum; Arches; Deformation; Dynamic response; High speed cameras; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Selective laser melting; Auxetic reentrant honeycomb; Hexagonal aluminum honeycombs; Impulsive loading; Metallic cellular materials; Negative poisson's ratios; Sandwich arches; Selective laser melting (SLM); Three dimensional digital imaging; Loading","Sun, Guangyong, Experimental and numerical study on honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and in-panel compression, Materials and Design, 133, pp. 154-168, (2017); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, (2006); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Polish Maritime Research, (2006); Hou, Xiuhui, Dynamic Crushing Strength Analysis of Auxetic Honeycombs, Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, 29, 5, pp. 490-501, (2016); Xiao, Dengbao, Insight into the negative Poisson's ratio effect of metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb under dynamic compression, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 763, (2019); Xiao, Dengbao, Compression behavior of the graded metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb: Experiment and finite element analysis, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 758, pp. 163-171, (2019); Zhou, Zhongxin, Plastic analyses of thin-walled steel honeycombs with re-entrant deformation style, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 688, pp. 123-133, (2017); Photiou, Demetris, On the conical indentation response of elastic auxetic materials: Effects of Poisson's ratio, contact friction and cone angle, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 81, pp. 33-42, (2016)",""

To examine the out-of-plane crashworthiness of this new type of hierarchical honeycomb concept, a finite element model is established and validated by existing theoretical and experimental results. Then, a parametric study on structural variables γ<inf>1</inf> and γ<inf>2</inf> was carried out with three different densities. The mechanical properties of hierarchical honeycombs are also compared with that of regular honeycombs. The research results show that the deformation patterns of hierarchical honeycombs can be divided into three categories. The energy absorption capability can be controlled effectively by proper adjustment of the hierarchical structural parameters. The specific energy absorption per unit mass (SEA<inf>m</inf>) of first-order spider-web hierarchical honeycomb with γ<inf>1</inf>=0.8 and second-order spider-web hierarchical honeycomb with γ<inf>1</inf>=0.8 and γ<inf>1</inf>=0.65 increases by 62.1% and 82.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the spider-web hierarchical characteristics have less influence on the corresponding Peak Crushing Force (PCF). Further, the mean crushing force is derived by dividing the profile into basic angle elements based on the Simplified Super Folding Element (SSFE) method. The theoretical calculation is in good agreement with the simulation results as the spider-web hierarchical honeycombs deform in Mode I. These results can provide valuable suggestions in the study and design of the new type hierarchical honeycombs. © The Author(s) 2018.","deformation pattern; energy absorption capability; Hierarchical honeycomb; out-of-plane crashworthiness; theoretical predictions","Crashworthiness; Crushing; Deformation; Energy absorption; Deformation pattern; Different densities; Energy absorption capability; Hierarchical honeycomb; Out-of plane; Specific energy absorption; Structural parameter; Theoretical calculations; Honeycomb structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); Shen, Changjian, Double shock mode in graded cellular rod under impact, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 50, 1, pp. 217-233, (2013); Qiu, Xinming, Collapse of periodic planar lattices under uniaxial compression, part I: Quasi-static strength predicted by limit analysis, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 10-11, pp. 1223-1230, (2009); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Sun, Deqiang, In-plane crushing and energy absorption performance of multi-layer regularly arranged circular honeycombs, Composite Structures, 96, pp. 726-735, (2013); Hu, Lingling, Dynamic crushing of the circular-celled honeycombs under out-of-plane impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 75, pp. 150-161, (2015); Berggren, Stein A., On stiffness properties of square honeycombs and other unidirectional composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 32, 6, pp. 503-511, (2001); Liang, Sen, Investigation on the square cell honeycomb structures under axial loading, Composite Structures, 72, 4, pp. 446-454, (2006); Zhang, Xiong, Theoretical and numerical investigation on the crush resistance of rhombic and kagome honeycombs, Composite Structures, 96, pp. 143-152, (2013)",""

Three different arrangements of unidirectional (UD) carbon fiber composite and the triaxially woven (TW) fabric were considered for the skins. The presence of a 10 mm crack at mid-span of the top skin, mid-span of the bottom skin, and mid-way between load and support of the top skin, respectively, were considered. Failure load equations of the load initiating the skin crack extension were analytically derived and then numerically developed using the J-integral approach.

Reducing structural mass is critical in aircraft and spacecraft development due to its direct impact on payload capacity and operational costs. Typically, hexagonal honeycombs manufactured by cold expansion of periodically bonded strips of metal or foils of other materials are used for sandwich construction. With rapid development in additive manufacturing, other core shapes with higher specific stiffness can now be considered as an alternative. The authors of this paper had previously evaluated triangular cores to have higher or comparable specific moduli as compared with other two-dimensional core shapes. Further, the panels constructed using triangular cores had higher stiffness than traditional hexagonal core panels. To consider practical use of the triangular cores, elastic-plastic structural analysis is performed to evaluate the strength and failure of sandwich panel construction. Load bearing capacity of triangular core panels under three-point bending, in-plane compressive loading, and transverse shear loading is evaluated using finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. The comparison made between triangular core and hexagonal core sandwich panels having the same cell size and relative density showed that triangular cores outperform hexagonal cores for applications where in-plane loading is dominant, whereas, in terms of transverse shear and out-of-plane loading, triangular core panels tend to fail at lower loads and lower deflections. © 2020 by the authors.

Both the localized tearing and the entrapped air affect the deformation pattern and the global mechanical response of the honeycomb in crash scenarios. The present paper documents development of an equivalent finite element model (FEM) for the aluminum honeycomb focusing on these two effects as well as the relevant experimental study. Four tests of the honeycomb block with out-of-plane loading, i.e., uniform compression, compression-shear along two orthogonal cross-sections and indentation, are performed at quasi-static and dynamic loading speeds to quantitatively address the tearing effect and the air effect on the entire mechanical response. It is also found that the honeycomb exhibits different tearing mechanisms along the two orthogonal cross-sections. In developing the solid-element based equivalent model for the honeycomb, airbags are introduced to characterize the air effect, and beam elements with failure criteria are embedded to simulate the tearing effect. Parameters of the airbags and the beam elements in the equivalent FEM are determined based on different combinations of the honeycomb tests. Simulations of all the loading cases in the present study achieve good agreement with the test results in terms of the global mechanical response and overall deformation pattern, reflecting feasibility of the equivalent FEM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air effect; Aluminum honeycomb; Equivalent finite element model; Out-of-plane loading; Tearing","Accidents; Aluminum; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Finite element method; Shear flow; Stress analysis; Thin walled structures; Air Effect; Aluminum honeycomb; Deformation pattern; Mechanical response; Orthogonal cross-sections; Out-of-plane loading; Tearing; Testing and modeling; Honeycomb structures","Zhou, Qing, Characterization of aluminum honeycomb material failure in large deformation compression, shear, and tearing, Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology, 124, 4, pp. 412-420, (2002); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Asprone, Domenico, Statistical finite element analysis of the buckling behavior of honeycomb structures, Composite Structures, 105, pp. 240-255, (2013); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Wierzbicki, Tomasz, Crushing analysis of metal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 1, 2, pp. 157-174, (1983); Chen, Weigang, Relative merits of single-cell, multi-cell and foam-filled thin-walled structures in energy absorption, Thin-Walled Structures, 39, 4, pp. 287-306, (2001); Xu, Shanqing, Experimental study of the out-of-plane dynamic compression of hexagonal honeycombs, Composite Structures, 94, 8, pp. 2326-2336, (2012); Zhao, Han, Crushing behaviour of aluminium honeycombs under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 10, pp. 827-836, (1998); Ashab, Asm S.M., Experimental investigation of the mechanical behavior of aluminum honeycombs under quasi-static and dynamic indentation, Materials and Design, 74, pp. 138-149, (2015); Xu, Shanqing, Strength enhancement of aluminium honeycombs caused by entrapped air under dynamic out-of-plane compression, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 47, pp. 1-13, (2012)",""

The production of aluminium honeycomb composite structures was carried out using different adhesives of different widths and heights. The low-velocity impact experiments of the honeycomb structures produced were performed according to ASTM D7766 standard. As a result of the experiment, the force values which caused damage to the structure were measured according to the time, and the maximum force values were taken. Findings have shown that the decrease in cell width, the increase in cell height, and depletion of multiwall carbon nanotubes increase the maximum impact force values in honeycomb composite structures.

Such collisions have resulted in human casualties and partial or full collapse of bridge structures. In the U.S., 15% of bridge failures were due to a vehicle collision. Increasing traffic volume resulted in an increase of collision events, especially with over-height trucks on highways. Innovative impact protection systems have become a point of interest to protect both structures and human lives. Metamaterial systems that have the ability to exhibit unusual properties such as negative stiffness behavior can dissipate high levels of energy. Such systems became a point of interest in base isolation, impact protection, and shock absorption applications. Bi-stable elements such as pre-buckled beams can be designed to exhibit negative stiffness behavior under transverse loading. Recent studies have shown that such systems can dissipate up to 70% of the input energy by transferring from one mode of buckling to another. The snap-through behavior of such elements remains in the elastic region of the material, which allows the system to recover the initial configuration after unloading. Finite element modeling (FEM) of bi-stable elements was carried out to address the bi-stability behavior and predict the force threshold as well as the amount of energy dissipated through such elements. FEM results were validated with experimental results. Key parameters that affect the behavior of bi-stable elements were investigated to study the different force thresholds and energy dissipation levels. The developed FEM can be used to predict the behavior of bi-stable elements and hence, design them in accordance with force thresholds and energy dissipation requirements. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

The material that is currently being used for blast protection is armored steel. Although it has high strength and toughness its strength to weight ratio is low which limits the applications of armored steel. Hence to overcome this limitation a sandwich composite was considered as an alternative to steel for blast protection. The sandwich composite had the top layer as Ceramic matrix composite to withstand high temperatures, core as a honeycomb structure and bottom layer as polymer matrix composite to stop the core from deforming excessively. The composite was modeled in Abaqus/Explicit and with the help of literature, the blast load was simulated as a triangular pulse in the form of the number of Tri Nitro Toluene (TNT) exploded. The performance of the composite was investigated by analyzing the amount of energy absorbed by the material upon impact and was compared with the performance of armored steel. The results showed that the sandwich composite was able to perform better than or equal to steel up to the explosion of 3 kg of TNT. But beyond 3 kg TNT its performance degrades and becomes lower than steel. Beyond explosion of 3 kg TNT the top layer, Ceramic matrix composite fails which exposes the inner core to the blast environment. As the amount of explosive increases, the core starts to undergo excess deformation and after a certain load, the deformation exceeds the limit of the bottom layer leading to the failure of the polymer matrix composite. Therefore, the proposed sandwich composite performs better than steel within a given working condition but beyond its working condition, its performance degrades resulting in failure of sandwich composite. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Finite element method; Honeycomb core; Micro-mechanical model; Sandwich composite; Strength to weight ratio","Ceramic matrix composites; Deformation; Explosives; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Abaqus/explicit; Blast protection; Bottom layers; High strength and toughness; High temperature; Impact loadings; Sandwich composites; Strength to weight ratio; Polymer matrix composites","Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, (1990); Mechanical Metallurgy of Armour Steels, (2016); Jin, Xiaochao, Dynamic response of sandwich structures with graded auxetic honeycomb cores under blast loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 106, pp. 206-217, (2016); Zirconium Di Boride Zirconium Boride Powder Zr B2; Silicon Carbide Sic Properties and Applications Carbo System, (2018); undefined, (2018); Tech Research Reviews Inventi Journals P Ltd, (2010); Euro Fibers; Geers Mmulti Scale Modeling of Textile Composites Thiam Wai Chua Mt10 19; Draganić, Hrvoje, Blast Loading on Structures, Tehnicki Vjesnik, 19, 3, pp. 643-652, (2012)",""

The nature of welding induces a variation in the geometric properties of the joint that connects the core to the faces. The geometric properties of the joint are the weld width, weld misalignment, and plate gap between the core and the faces. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the variation of the production-dependent geometric properties of the joint on the fatigue-relevant stresses. A secondary aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of contact between the core and the faces on the weld region stresses. Within this paper, the production of four sandwich panels is documented and the manufacturing-dependent geometric properties of their joints are quantified. In order to investigate the impact of the natural variation of the parameters, a parametric study based on finite element analyses is executed. The result of the parametric study shows, among several other findings, that misalignment of the weld line in relation to the core direction can lead to considerable increases in stresses, determinant for the fatigue life of the panel. © 2019, The Author(s).","Corrugated core; Fatigue; Joint geometry; Laser weld; Steel sandwich panel","Alignment; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Manufacture; Sandwich structures; Welding; Welds; Corrugated core; Geometric properties; Joint geometry; Laser welds; Natural variation; Parametric study; Sandwich panel; Steel sandwich panels; Fatigue of materials","Hyblas Economical and Safe Laser Hybrid Welding of Structural Steel, (2009); Peters, Rigo, Laser-stake welded T-joints of all-steel sandwich panels - Fatigue strength of laser-stake welded T-joints, Stahlbau, 84, 9, pp. 643-649, (2015); Laser Hybrid Rapid ARC and Tandem Mag Welding A Comparative Study Project Vamp27, (2005); undefined, (2012); Frank, Darko, Fatigue assessment of laser stake-welded T-joints, International Journal of Fatigue, 33, 2, pp. 102-114, (2011); Innovative Road Bridges with Steel Sandwich Decks, (2014); Nilsson, Peter, Industrialized light-weight steel bridge concept using corrugated core steel sandwich plates, pp. 564-572, (2016); Laser Welded Steel Sandwich Panel Bridge Deck Development Finite Element Analysis and Stake Weld Strength Tests, (2009); Cheng, Qianhua, A numerical analysis approach for evaluating elastic constants of sandwich structures with various cores, Composite Structures, 74, 2, pp. 226-236, (2006); Zum Tragverhalten Von Lasergeschweis Sten Stahlhohlplatten Im Bruckenbau, (2012)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The light-weight materials with exceptional mechanical behaviors can be achieved by incorporating the reinforced mesostructure into the regular honeycomb structures. In the present work, a novel circular-celled honeycomb was proposed by incorporating the petal-shaped mesostructures into the regular circular cell honeycomb. The 3D finite element models of the petal-shaped honeycombs (PSH) are established to investigate the in-plane crushing behavior and energy absorption capacity under different impact velocities through the nonlinear finite element code LS-DYNA. A comparison between the regular circular-cell honeycomb, the single petal nested circular honeycomb and the PSH was carried out, and the simulation results indicated that the PSH exhibited the best mechanical behavior and energy absorption characteristics compared with the other two types of honeycombs. Three representative deformation modes, namely quasi-static, transition and dynamic mode, were observed from the numerical simulations of the PSH with different geometric configurations and impact loadings, and the failure mode map was also summarized to furtherly clarify the localized deformation characteristics. In addition, the influences of impact velocity and the relative density on the plateau stress and the energy absorption behavior of the PSH were also investigated in this paper. The results showed that the specific energy absorption of PSH can be improved by up to nearly twice than the regular circular honeycomb under the same impact speed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorption; Failure mode; Honeycomb; Petal-shaped mesostructure","Crushing; Deformation; Dynamics; Energy absorption; Failure modes; Finite element method; Absorbing characteristics; Absorption characteristics; Energy absorption capacity; Honeycomb; In-plane dynamic crushing; Mesostructures; Nonlinear Finite Element code LS-DYNA; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","Akil, Hazizan Md., The low velocity impact response of an aluminium honeycomb sandwich structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 34, 8, pp. 679-687, (2003); Dong, Liang, Mechanical response of Ti-6Al-4V octet-truss lattice structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 60, pp. 107-124, (2015); Liu, Hu, Effect of elastic target on Taylor-Hopkinson impact of low-density foam material, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 94, pp. 109-119, (2016); Yang, Xianfeng, A review of civil aircraft arresting system for runway overruns, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 102, pp. 99-121, (2018); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Arulanantham, M., Coupled radiative and conductive thermal transfers across transparent honeycomb insulation materials, Applied Thermal Engineering, 16, 3, pp. 209-217, (1996); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Yang, Xianfeng, Out-of-plane crashworthiness analysis of bio-inspired aluminum honeycomb patterned with horseshoe mesostructure, Thin-Walled Structures, 125, pp. 1-11, (2018); Mohamed Yusoff, Mohd Zuhri, The mechanical properties of natural fibre based honeycomb core materials, Composites Part B: Engineering, 58, pp. 1-9, (2014); Liang, Sen, Investigation on the square cell honeycomb structures under axial loading, Composite Structures, 72, 4, pp. 446-454, (2006)",""

Inspired by the chiral nature of double-helical structure of DNA molecule, in this paper, we present a design of helical structure with chirality and study its mechanical behaviors through experimental characterization, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. A compression-twisting coupling deformation mode is observed for different types of DNA-inspired helical structures due to the competition among compression, bending and twisting energy of the helical structures and tension energy of the interlinks. We find that interlinks between two intertwined helices are decisive to the compression-twisting coupling deformation mode and both chiral and non-chiral behaviors of the structures can be quantitively captured by our established theoretical and numerical models. The influences of various geometric parameters on the stiffness and deformation mode are discussed. Finally, we present two types of superposed structures that behave differently, showing a high designability of the DNA-inspired structures.

To meet this objective, facing sheets are manufactured using the polypropylene matrix and glass fibers. Polypropylene honeycombs are used in the study. Depending on the experimental boundary conditions, a cross-ply laminate set up is used for the facing sheets. An impact energy of 100 J is chosen in the study. This energy caused visible failure on the plywood sample. Hence a lighter sandwich construction which can resist 100 J impact is implemented in this study. Influence of top and bottom facing sheet thicknesses on the amount of damage inflicted on its surfaces are studied. Experimental histories of absorbed energy and contact force are recorded.

To help develop a high-performance protective system, this article outlines the performance evaluation of five different auxetic cell configurations based on a quantitative/qualitative review of an experimental load–deformation relationship of three-dimensional-printed auxetic panels from nylon plastics and the overall performance evaluation of metallic re-entrant honeycomb core sandwich panels as one type of lightweight protective system under static and dynamic loads via experimental testing and numerical simulations. The re-entrant honeycomb design displayed the most consistent auxetic behaviour. Quasi-static compression and drop hammer impact tests were performed using the proposed full-scale sandwich panel design with two different configurations as a protective system for concrete wall structures in combination with plastic face plates. The effect of the internal angle of the re-entrant honeycomb design and the effect of the core material under static and dynamic loads were evaluated using full-scale sandwich panels. Furthermore, two separate materials – acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and low-density polyethylene – were used as face plates, and the low-density polyethylene was effective for lightweight and smooth load transferring and distribution into the auxetic core. Auxetic panel deformation under static and dynamic load was examined using a normal speed camera and high-speed video recording data and all auxetic panels indicated excellent systematic crushing behaviour with drawing materials into the load path to effectively resist the impact load. Numerical simulations were performed using LS-DYNA and indicated good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, protective systems utilising sandwich panels with a re-entrant honeycomb core indicated strong potential for the development of high-performance lightweight impact-resistant protective systems. © The Author(s) 2019.","Auxetic; finite element analysis; impact loading; large-scale; negative Poisson’s ratio; sandwich panels; three-dimensional printing","3D printers; Accidents; Coremaking; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Finite element method; High speed cameras; Military vehicles; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Polyethylenes; Sandwich structures; Styrene; Video recording; Auxetic; Impact loadings; large-scale; S ratio; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Chen, Wensu, Numerical simulations of stiffened multi-arch double-layered panels subjected to blast loading, International Journal of Protective Structures, 4, 2, pp. 163-187, (2013); Codina, Ramón H., New sacrificial cladding system for the reduction of blast damage in reinforced concrete structures, International Journal of Protective Structures, 8, 2, pp. 221-236, (2017); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Mechanics and Materials in Design, (2017); Grima, Joseph N., On the potential of connected stars as auxetic systems, Molecular Simulation, 31, 13, pp. 925-935, (2005); Ha, Chan Soo, Chiral three-dimensional isotropic lattices with negative Poisson's ratio, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 253, 7, pp. 1243-1251, (2016); Habib, Fatah N., Cell geometry effect on in-plane energy absorption of periodic honeycomb structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 5-8, pp. 2369-2380, (2018); Habib, Fatah N., In-plane energy absorption evaluation of 3D printed polymeric honeycombs, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 12, 2, pp. 117-131, (2017); Hou, Yangqing, Graded conventional-auxetic Kirigami sandwich structures: Flatwise compression and edgewise loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 59, pp. 33-42, (2014); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018)",""

The results showed abnormal size effect in the peak stress for samples with height 2.10 mm. The high speed camera was used to capture the deformation process. Two deformation modes, i.e. the in-plane shear wrinkles (characterized as larger deformation and lower strength in the stress-strain curves) and the out-of-plane wall buckling (characterized as smaller deformation and higher strength in the stress-strain curves), were distinguished from the complicated deformation processes. The abnormal size effect was resulted from the dominance of in-plane shear failure for samples 2.10 mm, rather than the out-of-plane wall buckling for other samples. Further investigations were conducted in details on the effects of cell width, wall thickness, and ends constraint condition (i.e. ends bonded with face sheets) to the deformation process based on the experiments, theoretical analyses of buckling, and Finite Element method (FEM). The transition of two deformation modes was analyzed, and the abnormal size effect would disappear for samples with larger wall thickness.

In the same loading condition, these honeycombs exhibited distinct characteristics. After that, in-plane orthogonal biaxial crushing simulations were carried out. Deformation processes of honeycombs were analyzed and compared. Results illustrated that some deformation behaviors in the uniaxial crushing case still exist in the biaxial crushing analysis. Their deformation modes were drawn into deformation maps.

The aim of this study is to utilize this advantage to tailor and optimize cellular materials for impact energy-absorbing applications. The energy-absorbing performance of two types of lattice structure, namely, octagonal and Kelvin lattices, is investigated numerically and compared to the out-of-plane performance of the traditional honeycomb, under two different loading conditions. Firstly, the relative density of the three structures is kept constant and each structure is subjected to three different compression loading rates. Secondly, the three structures are designed to have the same stress threshold of 1 MPa at a loading rate of 3.5 m/s produced at the maximum energy-absorbing efficiency strain (εηmax), and they are subjected to an impact mass and an initial velocity of 1.75 kg and 3.5 m/s, respectively. For the second condition, an empirical relationship is established to relate the design parameters of each structure to the peak stress produced at the εηmax. Compression experiments are performed on the standard specimens of the thermoplastic base material at different strain rates to characterize its dynamic properties and rate sensitivity, for the numerical modeling. The finite element approach is validated against experimental results of published studies. The numerical results show that when the relative density is kept constant, the out-of-plane energy absorption of the traditional honeycomb, which is known for its high-energy absorption, significantly outperforms the two lattices for all loading rates. However, when the stress threshold is kept constant, the results show that both lattices can provide better energy-absorbing performance than the honeycomb. Finally, a methodology is developed to improve the energy absorption of the octagonal lattice and the traditional honeycomb; this enhances their energy-absorbing efficiency significantly, from 57 to 63% and from 44 to 61%, respectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; Cellular materials; Energy absorption; Finite element analysis; Graded structures; Johnson-Cook material model","Energy absorption; Energy efficiency; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Strain rate; Stress analysis; Structural design; 3-D printing; Cellular material; Compression experiments; Dynamic energy absorption; Empirical relationships; Energy absorbing efficiencies; Graded structure; Material modeling; 3D printers","Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Gibson, Lorna J., Cellular solids: Structure and properties, second edition, pp. 1-510, (2014); Maiti, Surjya K., Deformation and energy absorption diagrams for cellular solids, Acta Metallurgica, 32, 11, pp. 1963-1975, (1984); Harris, J.

The reentrant honeycomb cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). According to experiment results, the failure modes of the sandwich beam were investigated. It was found that sandwich beam with different honeycomb cell's thicknesses could fail in different modes. Meanwhile, the local negative Poisson's ratio deformation was observed in the thin honeycomb core. Based on this, a finite element (FE) model was constructed to analysis the dynamic deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant honeycomb core. The local auxetic and expand deformations of honeycomb core were both found.

Direct and indirect explosionswith different equivalent explosivemasses are applied to investigate the in-plane deformation characteristics and energy-absorbing distribution of aluminum honeycombs. Two finite element models of honeycombs, i.e., rigid plate-honeycomb-rigid plate (RP-H-RP) and honeycomb-rigid plate (H-RP) are created. The models indicate that there are three deformation modes in the X1 direction for the RP-H-RP, which are the overall response mode at low equivalent explosivemasses, transitional responsemode atmediumequivalent explosivemasses, and local responsemode at large equivalent explosivemasses, respectively. Meanwhile, the honeycombs exhibit two deformationmodes in the X2 direction, i.e., the expansionmode at low equivalent explosive masses and local inner concave mode at large equivalent explosive masses, respectively. Interestingly, a counter-intuitive phenomenon is observed on the loaded boundary of the H-RP. Besides, the energy distribution and buffering capacity of different parts on the honeycomb models are discussed. In a unit cell, most of the energy is absorbed by the edges with an edge thickness of 0.04 mm while little energy is absorbed by the other bilateral edges. For the buffering capacity, the honeycomb in the X1 direction behaves better than that in the X2 direction. © 2019 by the authors.","Aluminum honeycomb; Counter-intuitive behavior; Deformation modes; Energy distribution; Shock wave","Aluminum; Deformation; Explosives; Plates (structural components); Shock waves; Aluminum honeycomb; Buffering capacities; Counter-intuitive behavior; Counter-intuitive phenomenon; Deformation modes; Energy distributions; Honeycomb models; In-plane deformation; Honeycomb structures","Wierzbicki, Tomasz, On the crushing mechanics of thi-n-walled structures, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 50, 4, pp. 727-734, (1983); Baker, William E., Static and dynamic properties of high-density metal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 3, pp. 149-163, (1998); Qin, Haoxing, Design method of lightweight metamaterials with arbitrary Poisson's ratio, Materials, 11, 9, (2018); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Miller, Wayne, Honeycomb cores with enhanced buckling strength, Composite Structures, 93, 3, pp. 1072-1077, (2011); Zhang, Xiong, Experimental and numerical studies on the crush resistance of aluminum honeycombs with various cell configurations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 66, pp. 48-59, (2014); Li, Xiangcheng, Inserting Stress Analysis of Combined Hexagonal Aluminum Honeycombs, Shock and Vibration, 2016, (2016); Ayman Ashab, A.

The dynamic behaviour of sandwich panels is typically studied for impact loading at normal angle of incidence but the structures are more frequently loaded at some oblique angle or with a complex tri-dimensional trajectory in real engineering situations. The damage area and damage modes for these trajectories are significantly different and it is not sufficient to study only normal impacts. There are well established experimental protocols for normal or oblique impact tests using devices like the drop tower, but impacts with complex trajectory are difficult to characterise experimentally. In this paper, a Gough-Stewart platform with six degrees of freedom has been modified to develop an original tri-dimensional impact device called Hexapod. The trajectory is defined to an impactor attached to the seventh jack of the Hexapod to study the response of sandwich plates to impact loading with complex trajectories. The applicability of the newly developed device is demonstrated by studying parabolic impact with different trajectories on sandwich plates with Kevlar facesheets and Rohacell foam core. The time history of vertical and horizontal components of force is measured using tri-axial load cell and strain history is obtained from Digital Image Correlation of a high speed camera images. The results of the parabolic impact show the importance of shear behaviour of the foam in the progression of damage in the sandwich panels. Additionally, the response of the sandwich panels to parabolic impact was simulated numerically using explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. The results of the FE model are compared with experimental data in terms of the force history and strain contours. © 2019","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Foams; High speed cameras; Honeycomb structures; Marine applications; Offshore structures; Plates (structural components); Trajectories; Complex trajectories; Digital image correlations; Experimental protocols; Explicit finite element codes; Foam core sandwich panels; Gough-Stewart platform; High-speed camera image; Six degrees of freedom; Sandwich structures","Caliskan, Umut, Low velocity bending impact behavior of foam core sandwich beams: Experimental, Composites Part B: Engineering, 112, pp. 158-175, (2017); Chai, Gin Boay, A review of low-velocity impact on sandwich structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 225, 4, pp. 207-230, (2011); Hampson, Paul R., A review of composite structures subjected to dynamic loading, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 12, 4, pp. 411-428, (2007); Ramakrishnan, Karthik Ram, Effect of block copolymer nano-reinforcements on the low velocity impact response of sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 110, 1, pp. 174-182, (2014); Ivañez, Inés, The oblique impact response of composite sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 1127-1136, (2015); Sutherland, L.

The Reddy's high-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) is employed to evaluate the in-plane displacement variables. By combining the extended Hamilton's principle with the finite element method and adopting the Rayleigh's proportional damping, the global mass, damping and stiffness matrices are determined first. Then, the central displacement of the FG honeycomb reinforced laminate plate is obtained with the aid of the Newmark's method. Next, several key factors affecting the central displacement in the whole impact duration are analyzed and compared, such as the hygrothermal effects, the radius of the impactor and the functionally gradient factor.

The purpose of the study was to extend laser forming to bend sandwich panels consisting of metallic facesheets joined to a metal foam core. Metal foam sandwich panels combine the excellent shock-absorption properties and low weight of metal foam with the wear resistance and strength of metallic facesheets, making them desirable for many applications in fields such as aerospace, the automotive industry, and solar power plants. To better understand the bending behavior of metal foam sandwich panels, as well as the impact of laser forming on the material properties, the fundamental mechanisms that govern bending deformation during laser forming were analyzed. It was found that the well-established bending mechanisms that separately govern solid metal and metal foam laser forming still apply to sandwich panel laser forming. However, two mechanisms operate in tandem, and a separate mechanism is responsible for the deformation of the solid facesheet and the foam core. From the bending mechanism analysis, it was concluded on the maximum achievable bending angle and the overall efficiency of the laser forming process at different process conditions. Throughout the analysis, experimental results were complemented by numerical simulations that were obtained using two finite element models that followed different geometrical approaches. © 2019 Laser Institute of America.","","Automotive industry; Bending (deformation); Bending (forming); Honeycomb structures; Metals; Sandwich structures; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Wear resistance; Bending mechanism; Engineering applications; Fundamental mechanisms; Geometrical approaches; Laser forming process; Overall efficiency; Process condition; Shock-absorption properties; Metal foams","Metal Foams A Design Guide, (2000); Claar, T.

However, the estimation of contact force is challenging as it involves wide uncertainties arising from initial conditions, geometrical and material parameters. Due to complex dynamic failure modes, the analytical solution fails to accurately predict the contact force. Therefore, the current study aims to propose a probabilistic model that can predict peak dynamic contact force when honeycomb structures are subjected to low velocity impacts. In the initial phase of this study, material and geometric parameters that could influence the response are studied in detail. The probabilistic model is developed based on these parameters and provides an estimate of peak contact force for impact energies within the defined limits. To develop the probabilistic model, we resorted to numerical simulations. It is shown that the numerical results are converging with low velocity impact experiments. Extensive finite element simulations are conducted at selective design points to generate a representative data for calibrating the probabilistic model. Once calibrated the probabilistic model circumvents any further dependency on conducting expensive FE simulations or experiments and expresses the contact force using simple explicit equation. In this paper, the emphasis is laid on the developing a probabilistic framework which could account for uncertainties involved in the estimate of structural response. The proposed model helps in designing robust honeycomb composites for application in aerospace structures. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Contact force model; finite element analysis (FEA); honeycomb; linear regression; low-velocity impact","Composite structures; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Linear regression; Rolling resistance; Uncertainty analysis; Velocity; Contact force models; Dynamic contact forces; Estimation of contacts; Finite element simulations; honeycomb; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Low velocity impact; Probabilistic framework; Structural design","Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Anderson, Todd A., Experimental investigation of low-velocity impact characteristics of sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 50, 3, pp. 239-247, (2000); Bao, Yiwang, Investigation of the relationship between elastic modulus and hardness based on depth-sensing indentation measurements, Acta Materialia, 52, 18, pp. 5397-5404, (2004); Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Choe, Doeun, Probabilistic capacity models and seismic fragility estimates for RC columns subject to corrosion, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 93, 3, pp. 383-393, (2008); Choi, Ik-hyeon, Contact force history analysis of composite sandwich plates subjected to low-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 75, 1-4, pp. 582-586, (2006); Crupi, Vincenzo, Collapse modes in aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 6-15, (2012); Fang, Jianguang, On hierarchical honeycombs under out-of-plane crushing, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 135, pp. 1-13, (2018); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Dynamic models for low-velocity impact damage of composites sandwich panels - Part A: Deformation, Composite Structures, 52, 3-4, pp. 335-351, (2001); Feng, Dianshi, Damage prediction in composite sandwich panels subjected to low-velocity impact, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 52, pp. 12-22, (2013)",""

It is shown that the presence of ligament curvature permits to attain mechanical responses which are not achievable through conventional chiral honeycomb designs. In addition, the resulting responses exhibit, for all considered load cases, significant tunability through the investigated geometrical design parameters. Two chiral lattices with identical geometries, only differing in their ligament curvature, were manufactured and experimentally tested to validate the finite elements predictions.

Military accidents with improvised explosive devices (IED) perfectly reflect this type of pelvic fracture. The finite element (FE) model of lumbar-pelvic complex (LPC) was developed based on computed tomography (CT) scans with the seat including steel frame, padding and soft tissue. The correlation coefficients of both low (100 N) and high (500 N) loads were greater than that currently obtained in the literature due to the presence of muscle force, pubic symphysis and joint cartilage. The dynamic analysis was performed to determine the influence of varying kinds of foam materials i.e. polyurethane, aluminium honeycomb structured and polyurethane auxetic foam on the stress/strain distribution in LPC under vertical impact load with the velocity of 7 m/s. Performed analysis showed the first fracture occurred in the L5 vertebrae resulting in the sacroiliac ligaments disruption and stress concentration in the pelvic ring causing further fractures of the wing of ilium, pubis and ischium bones. This results clearly explain the inconclusive findings about the second fracture that occurs in the pelvic area under a vertical impact load. The applied seat padding foam significantly reduced the stresses transmitted to the anatomical structures, thereby avoiding the risk of pelvic fracture. The analysis has proven that the auxetic polyurethane foam can be used as a good energy absorber. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Finite element analysis; Malgaigne fracture; pelvis fracture; vertical load","Computerized tomography; Energy absorption; Explosives; Finite element method; Loads (forces); Polyurethanes; Aluminium honeycomb; Anatomical structures; Computed tomography scan; Correlation coefficient; Fracture mechanisms; Improvised explosive devices; Polyurethane Foam; Vertical load; Fracture; Article; computer assisted tomography; finite element analysis; human; iliac bone; ischium; Malgaigne fracture; pelvis fracture; priority journal; pubic bone; pubis symphysis; stress; validation process; biomechanics; fracture; ligament; lumbar vertebra; mechanical stress; pathology; pelvic girdle; reproducibility; weight bearing; Biomechanical Phenomena; Finite Element Analysis; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Ligaments; Lumbar Vertebrae; Pelvic Bones; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Mechanical; Weight-Bearing","undefined, (2011); Arkusz, Katarzyna, The influence of osteoporotic bone structures of the pelvic-hip complex on stress distribution under impact load, Acta of Bioengineering and Biomechanics, 20, 1, pp. 29-38, (2018); Ayman Ashab, A.

An analytical model is built to investigate the in-plane elastic properties of the newly proposed honeycomb and the results are in good agreement with the finite element simulations. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy absorption capabilities of SAH are studied systematically by finite element method and are compared with that of SSH and DAH. Two plateau stress regions in the stress–strain curves of SAH are observed under low-velocity impact loading, and the second plateau stress is over three times higher than the first one. The in-plane Poisson's ratio of SAH under static and high-velocity impact loading always shows negative value. However, the Poisson's ratio of SAH changes from negative to positive under low-velocity and medium-velocity impact loading. In addition, the Poisson's ratio of SSH and DAH are negative during the entire dynamic deformation processes. The results of finite element simulations show that SAH can absorb much more energy than SSH with the same relative densities under different impact velocities, especially under low-velocity impact loading. Furthermore, the effects of the cell wall thickness and the impact velocity on plateau stress of SAH are discussed, and therefore a deformation map is summarized. It can be concluded that SAH is a better choice for energy absorption. This study may provide a new design concept for the high performance honeycomb structure with multi plateau stress regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deformation mode; Elastic property; Energy absorption; Negative Poisson's ratio; Plateau stress","Crushing; Deformation; Elasticity; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Poisson ratio; Stars; Stress analysis; Velocity; Deformation modes; Elastic properties; Energy absorption capability; Energy absorption capacity; Finite element simulations; In-plane dynamic crushing; Negative poisson's ratios; Plateau stress; Loading","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Evans, Anthony G., Multifunctionality of cellular metal systems, Progress in Materials Science, 43, 3, pp. 171-221, (1998); Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); Hu, Lingling, Effect of cell-wall angle on the in-plane crushing behaviour of hexagonal honeycombs, Materials and Design, 46, pp. 511-523, (2013); Liu, Ying, The influence of cell micro-topology on the in-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 98-109, (2009); Qiu, Xinming, Collapse of periodic planar lattices under uniaxial compression, part I: Quasi-static strength predicted by limit analysis, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 10-11, pp. 1223-1230, (2009); Qiu, Xinming, Collapse of periodic planar lattices under uniaxial compression, part II: Dynamic crushing based on finite element simulation, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 10-11, pp. 1231-1241, (2009); Habib, Fatah N., Cell geometry effect on in-plane energy absorption of periodic honeycomb structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 5-8, pp. 2369-2380, (2018); Zhang, Dahai, In–plane dynamic crushing behavior and energy absorption of honeycombs with a novel type of multi-cells, Thin-Walled Structures, 117, pp. 199-210, (2017)",""

Theoretical analysis of regular hexagonal honeycomb with parallel gradient configuration (HPGC) demonstrates that it can achieve a maximum of more than 70% enhancement of static strength in the x direction compared with uniform honeycomb (UH) of the same relative density. Furthermore, static enhancement coefficient is irrelevant to the average relative density of HPGC, which means the degree of enhancement under certain density gradient is constant no matter what the relative density is employed. This is efficient for fast performance-oriented design. The mechanism of strength enhancement is discussed. Result shows that parallel design is applicable to many cellular solids who are eligible for the special relations (for example, the linear relation between graded variable t and relative density and the nonlinear relation between graded variable t and crushing strength). Dynamic analysis shows that the dynamic crushing strength is also enhanced by parallel design. In addition, parallel design is able to reduce the sensitivity of dynamic crushing strength to the impact velocity. Finite element analyses (FEA) are carried out to verify the theoretical results. This novel design provides huge potentials to cellular solids with high-level strength and lightweight applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Honeycombs; In-plane compression; Lateral piecewise linear gradient; Parallel design; Reduction of dynamic sensitivity; Strength enhancement","Crushing; Honeycomb structures; Piecewise linear techniques; Dynamic sensitivity; Honeycombs; In-plane compression; Parallel design; Piecewise linear; Strength enhancement; Compressive strength","Ruan, Dong, In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycombs - A finite element study, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 28, 2, pp. 161-182, (2003); Hu, Lingling, Effect of cell-wall angle on the in-plane crushing behaviour of hexagonal honeycombs, Materials and Design, 46, pp. 511-523, (2013); Zhang, Xinchun, Effects of defects on the in-plane dynamic crushing of metal honeycombs, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 52, 10, pp. 1290-1298, (2010); Hu, Lingling, Analyses on the dynamic strength of honeycombs under the y-directional crushing, Materials and Design, 53, pp. 293-301, (2014); Sun, Guangyong, Crashworthiness of vertex based hierarchical honeycombs in out-of-plane impact, Materials and Design, 110, pp. 705-719, (2016); Hu, Lingling, The inhomogeneous deformation of polycarbonate circular honeycombs under in-plane compression, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 50, 7, pp. 1224-1236, (2008); Li, Zhen, Design-oriented crushing analysis of hexagonal honeycomb core under in-plane compression, Composite Structures, 187, pp. 429-438, (2018); Li, Zhen, Comparative study of the in-plane uniaxial and biaxial crushing of hexagonal, re-entrant, and mixed honeycombs, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 21, 6, pp. 1991-2013, (2019); Wang, Yuanlong, Analysis and parametric optimization of a novel sandwich panel with double-V auxetic structure core under air blast loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 142-143, pp. 245-254, (2018); Chen, Liming, Dynamic crushing behavior and energy absorption of graded lattice cylindrical structure under axial impact load, Thin-Walled Structures, 127, pp. 333-343, (2018)",""

In this paper, a novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb is proposed and named as re-entrant star-shaped honeycomb (RSH), with the in-plane impact responses explored theoretically and numerically. Three types of microstructural deformation modes are observed under different impact velocities, including low-velocity mode, medium-velocity mode and high-velocity mode. Moreover, a deformation map is summarized to illustrate the effects of the impact velocity and the relative density on the deformation modes. Two typical plateau stress regions are detected under low-velocity impact loading, and the second plateau stress is almost twice higher than the first one. The transverse contraction of the RSH mainly occurs at the first plateau region, which is different for the classical re-entrant honeycomb (RH). In addition, the absorbed energy of the RSH decreases slightly and then increases with the impact velocity. The results of the finite element simulations suggest that the RSH shows more excellent impact resistance, compared with the RH and SSH with same cell wall thickness. Furthermore, the effects of the cell wall thickness and the impact velocity on the crushing strength of the RSH are discussed, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the finite element simulations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic honeycomb; Deformation mode; Energy absorption; Impact velocity; Plateau stress","Biomechanics; Deformation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Stress analysis; Auxetic honeycomb; Cell-wall thickness; Deformation modes; Finite element simulations; Impact velocities; Low velocity impact; Microstructural deformation; Plateau stress; Velocity","Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Williams, John Leicester, Properties and an anisotropic model of cancellous bone from the proximal tibial epiphysis, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 104, 1, pp. 50-56, (1982); Lees, Caroline M., Poisson’s ratio in skin, Bio-Medical Materials and Engineering, 1, 1, pp. 19-23, (1991); Frolich, Larry M., Poisson's ratio of a crossed fibre sheath: the skin of aquatic salamanders, Journal of Zoology, 232, 2, pp. 231-252, (1994); Yeganeh-Haeri, Amir, Elasticity of α-cristobalite: A silicon dioxide with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 257, 5070, pp. 650-652, (1992); Milstein, Frederick, Existence of a negative Poisson ratio in fcc crystals, Physical Review B-Condensed Matter, 19, 4, pp. 2030-2033, (1979); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Alderson, Andrew, A triumph of lateral thought, Chemistry and Industry (London), 10, (1999); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Alderson, Andrew, Auxetic materials, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 221, 4, pp. 565-575, (2007)",""

Indeed, especially for advanced applications, there is a growing pressure towards the reduction of the weight of protective structures without compromising their energy absorption capability. The complexity of the phenomena induced by high-energy contacts requires advanced and efficient computational models, which are also fundamental for achieving the optimum, overcoming the limits of experimental tests and physical prototyping in exploring the whole design space. At the same time, the modeling of bio-inspired toughening mechanisms requires additional capability of these methods to efficiently cover and merge different -and even disparate- size and time scales. In this chapter, we review computational methods for modeling the mechanical behavior of materials and structures under high-velocity (e.g., ballistic) impacts and crushing, with a particular focus on the nonlinear finite element method. Some recent developments in numerical simulation of impact are presented underlining merits, limits, and open problems in the modeling of bio-inspired and nanomaterial-based armors.

In order to investigate the effect of reaction force and energy absorption capacity, honeycomb cores with different densities were selected. Afterward, the behavior of honeycomb structures was numerically simulated in the ABAQUS software. The results of finite element analysis show that using foam filling in honeycomb structures increases energy absorption. The structures filled with graded foam, shows better performance with the rate of stiffness reduction from impact location compared to those filled with nongraded foam. Energy absorption for graded foam structure occurs at a longer time period comparing to nongraded one. The energy absorption capacity of the structure under out-of-plane loading is much higher than in-plane loading, but its reaction force is very high. The results of empirical tests are greatly similar to that of numerical studies.

Composite offers perspectives related to mass and stiffness ratio. However, the dispersion of their mechanical properties due to environmental conditions or impact behaviour hinders their development. Currently, honeycomb solutions and complex energy absorption mechanisms are used. The sizing of structures is controlled for conventional loads, but not for severe cases such avian impact. In the context of the development of an innovative reinforced aeronautical structure, the objective of this study is to identify and characterize a new concept of absorbent composite material at the coupon scale. In order to improve reliability and optimize its absorption characteristics during high-energy impact, works are realized to develop in parallel an experimental study methodology and a finite element model. The purpose of the latter is to have a predictive tool validated by correlation with experimental to ensure virtual testing. Lack of knowledge of the nonlinear behaviour of the composite material at high deformation, for different speeds, as well as the mechanisms of damage and fracture are locks to its development. Absence of a dedicated experiment matrix presents a difficulty for its characterization and sizing. The approach begins with the analysis and prioritization of the existing to determine the definition criteria of the new concept. After development of an experimental characterization study, the qualification and justification of the new concept is validated by correlation with a dedicated numerical simulation methodology.

The honeycomb sandwich structure consists of two identical functionally graded face sheets, having different material compositions through the thickness, and an aluminum honeycomb core. The functionally graded face sheets consist of ceramic (SiC) and aluminum (Al 6061) phases. The through-thickness mechanical properties of face sheets are assumed to vary according to a power-law. The locally effective material properties are evaluated using the Mori–Tanaka scheme. The effect of material composition of functionally graded face sheets on the ballistic performance of honeycomb sandwich structures was investigated using the finite element method and the penetration and perforation threshold energy values on ballistic performance and ballistic limit of the sandwich structures are determined.

Owing to their lightweight, high strength, damage tolerance and thermal resistance, they are extensively used as a solution to modern engineering problems in the vehicle structure’s design. Furthermore, lightweight polymeric foams can be exploited to improve mechanical properties of sandwich panels. Recently, foam filled honeycomb sandwich panels have been proposed in order to benefit from mechanical characteristics of both honeycomb cellular structure and polymeric foam in the core of the sandwich panel. Until now, most of the investigations were delved into the mechanical properties of the foam filled honeycomb sandwich panels; in plane crushing, out of plane impact and local indentation response of these panels were broadly discussed previously. On the other hand, since many vehicles’ failure are related to severe vibrations, clear understanding of foam filled honeycomb panels eigenvibration properties is vital. In this paper, vibration frequencies and mode shape of honeycomb sandwich panels with different cores are studied using numerical method. At the first step, elastic mechanical properties of polyurethane foams were determined by experimental tests, next a finite element model was developed by means of Abaqus software package. Parameters, such as first resonant frequency, mode shapes and influence of foams on local vibration of the honeycomb core were investigated. © 2017, © 2017 Engineers Australia.","finite element analysis; Honeycomb sandwich panel; modal analysis; polyurethane foam","ABAQUS; Finite element method; Indentation; Mechanical properties; Modal analysis; Natural frequencies; Numerical methods; Polyurethanes; Rigid foamed plastics; Sandwich structures; Software testing; Structural panels; Thermal Engineering; Vibration analysis; Elastic mechanical properties; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Mechanical characteristics; Modern engineering; Polyurethane Foam; Transportation industry; Vehicle structures; Vibration frequency; Honeycomb structures","Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Burlayenko, Vyacheslav N., Analysis of structural performance of sandwich plates with foam-filled aluminum hexagonal honeycomb core, Computational Materials Science, 45, 3, pp. 658-662, (2009); Chen, Yunghsiang, Dynamic characteristics of layered beam with flexible core, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 116, 3, pp. 350-356, (1994); Dawe, D.

It was found that the density gradient of graded foam cores had a marked influence on the deformation and failure behaviour of front facesheets. Moreover, different facesheet materials were experimented with a homogeneous foam core, and the results showed that the impact response of a sandwich panel was dominated by its front facesheet. The front facesheets having same materials deformed and failed in the same manner irrespective of the back facesheet materials. The results of finite element analysis indicated that the critical impact energy required to cause failure to the front facesheet increased with the density of first core layer.

Finally, the energy finite element method (EFEM) is developed to obtain the energy density of structures at the different frequencies by using the coefficients before. The results show that the sizes of mass block and the input frequencies of micro-vibration wave have important effects on isolation, and the bigger mass blocks have a better performance.

The Hertz law between the impactor and the plate is taken into account. Using the Extended High Order Sandwich Panel Theory (EHSAPT) and the Ritz energy method, the governing equations are derived. The skins follow the Third order shear deformation theory (TSDT) that has hitherto not reported in conventional EHSAPT. Besides, the three dimensional elasticity is used for the core. The nonlinear Von Karman relations for strains of skins and the core are adopted. Time domain solution of such equations is extracted by means of the well-known fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The effects of core-to-skin thickness ratio, initial velocity of the impactor, the impactor mass and position of the impactor are studied in detail. It is found that these parameters play significant role in the impact force and dynamic response of the sandwich plate.

The purpose of the study was to extend laser forming to bend sandwich panels consisting of metallic facesheets joined to a metal foam core. Metal foam sandwich panels combine the excellent shock-absorption properties and low weight of metal foam with the wear resistance and strength of metallic facesheets, making them desirable for many applications in fields such as aerospace, the automotive industry, and solar power plants. To better understand the bending behavior of metal foam sandwich panels, as well as the impact of laser forming on the material properties, the fundamental mechanisms that govern bending deformation during laser forming were analyzed. It was found that the well-established bending mechanisms that separately govern solid metal and metal foam laser forming still apply to sandwich panel laser forming. However, two mechanisms operate in tandem, and a separate mechanism is responsible for the deformation of the solid facesheet and the foam core. From the bending mechanism analysis, it was concluded on the maximum achievable bending angle and the overall efficiency of the laser forming process at different process conditions. Throughout the analysis, experimental results were complemented by numerical simulations that were obtained using two finite element models that followed different geometrical approaches. © 2018 by ASME.","bending mechanism; laser forming; metal foam; numerical simulation; sandwich panel","Automotive industry; Bending (deformation); Bending (forming); Computer simulation; Honeycomb structures; Metals; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Wear resistance; Bending mechanism; Engineering applications; Fundamental mechanisms; Geometrical approaches; Laser forming process; Laser-forming; Sandwich panel; Shock-absorption properties; Metal foams","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Metal Foams A Design Guide, (2000); Srivastava, V.

On this basis, the effectiveness of the composite structure and aluminium honeycomb finite element model (FEM) is validated by conducting trolley impact tests and quasi-static compression experiments. Based on the verified FEM, the surrogate models, including polynomial response surface (PRS), Kriging, radial basis function (RBF) and supported vector regression (SVR), are established to get the relationship between crashworthiness indexes and design variables. Then, the most accurate model is employed for crashworthiness optimisation through comparing the accuracies of these four models. Owing to the mutually effects among components of the composite EAS and the relatively complex mathematical formulae acquired by the high-precision surrogate model, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation (HPSO) algorithm is put forward. The performance of the HPSO is tested by a typical engineering optimisation case. The results indicate that the HPSO algorithm presents various advantages (e.g. strong global search capability, high optimisation accuracy, etc.). By optimising the mathematical model of the composite EAS, the optimal configurations of the structure are obtained, which confirms that the HPSO algorithm has favourable applicability and performance in the crashworthiness optimisation of the EASs for subway vehicles. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Composite energy-absorbing structure; Global search; Hybrid particle swarm optimisation; Impact test; Surrogate model","Accidents; Aluminum; Energy absorption; Fuel additives; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Railroads; Sandwich structures; Shape optimization; Thin walled structures; Composite energy; Global search; Global search capability; Hybrid particles; Mathematical formulas; Quasi-static compression experiment; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Surrogate model; Crashworthiness","Alavi, Ali, Effects of buckling initiators on mechanical behavior of thin-walled square tubes subjected to oblique loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 59, pp. 87-96, (2012); Alavi, Ali, An investigation on the energy absorption characteristics of multi-cell square tubes, Thin-Walled Structures, 68, pp. 26-34, (2013); Arasomwan, Akugbe Martins, On the performance of linear decreasing inertia weight particle swarm optimization for global optimization, Scientific World Journal, 2013, (2013); Baroutaji, Ahmad, Crush analysis and multi-objective optimization design for circular tube under quasi-static lateral loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 86, pp. 121-131, (2015); Chen, Siji, A novel multi-cell tubal structure with circular corners for crashworthiness, Thin-Walled Structures, 122, pp. 329-343, (2018); Chen, Yafeng, Crashworthiness analysis of octagonal multi-cell tube with functionally graded thickness under multiple loading angles, Thin-Walled Structures, 110, pp. 133-139, (2017); Clarke, Stella M., Analysis of support vector regression for approximation of complex engineering analyses, Journal of Mechanical Design, 127, 6, pp. 1077-1087, (2005); Coello, Carlos A., Constraint-handling in genetic algorithms through the use of dominance-based tournament selection, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 16, 3, pp. 193-203, (2002); Djamaluddin, Fauzan, Optimization of foam-filled double circular tubes under axial and oblique impact loading conditions, Thin-Walled Structures, 87, pp. 1-11, (2015); Duddeck, Fabian M.E., Topology optimization for crashworthiness of thin-walled structures under axial impact using hybrid cellular automata, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 54, 3, pp. 415-428, (2016)",""

In this study, low-velocity impact tests on the titanium honeycomb sandwich structures were carried out to obtain the impact dynamic response and investigate the typical impact damage modes and parameters including the depths and diameters of the facesheet indentation and the core crushing region. The test results showed that the maximum contact force, the diameter and depth of the indentation had strong positive correlations to the impact energy. Numerical analysis was also conducted to study the low-velocity impact behaviour of the titanium honeycomb sandwich structures by using parametric finite element models that contained all the geometric and the structural details of the titanium honeycomb cores. The numerical results successfully captured the typical low-velocity impact damage modes of the titanium sandwich structures, similar to those observed in the tests. The predicted impact dynamic response also agreed very well with the test data. By using the validated finite element models, a parameter sensitivity study on the effects of the structural parameters on the low-velocity impact damage behaviour of the titanium sandwich structures was conducted. The parametric analysis results showed that the impactor diameter, the facesheet thickness and the core cell wall thickness had positive effect on the maximum contact force, and negative effect on the indentation depth, while the height of the honeycomb core had positive effect on the contact force, but little influence on the indentation depth. © The Author(s) 2017.","cellular solid modelling; impact damage modes; impact dynamic response; low-velocity impact; sensitivity study; Titanium sandwich structures","Dynamic response; Finite element method; Sandwich structures; Titanium; Velocity; Cellular solids; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact damages; Low velocity impact; Low velocity impact test; Low-velocity impact damage; Parametric finite elements; Sensitivity studies; Honeycomb structures","Welding Technology, (2003); Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology, (2009); Huang, Xiao, Activated Diffusion Brazing Technology for Manufacture of Titanium Honeycomb Structures - A Statistical Study, Welding Journal, 83, 3, (2004); Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology, (2012); Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Herup, Eric J., Low-velocity impact damage initiation in graphite/epoxy/Nomex honeycomb-sandwich plates, Composites Science and Technology, 57, 12, pp. 1581-1598, (1998); Akil, Hazizan Md., The low velocity impact response of an aluminium honeycomb sandwich structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 34, 8, pp. 679-687, (2003); Dear, John P., Impact damage processes in composite sheet and sandwich honeycomb materials, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 130-154, (2005); Othman, Abdul Rahim, Failure initiation and propagation characteristics of honeycomb sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 85, 2, pp. 126-138, (2008); Foo, Choon Chiang, A model to predict low-velocity impact response and damage in sandwich composites, Composites Science and Technology, 68, 6, pp. 1348-1356, (2008)",""

Combining the eccentricity factor, amplitude factor with the basic folding mechanism, an analytical approach based on rigid perfectly plastic model is applied to predict the mean impact force of the ripplecomb under quasi-static axial crushing loading theoretically. The mean crushing force obtained from analytical model is well consistent with those of the simulation. Besides, parametric investigations are carried out to explore the influence of the wave amplitude, wave number and cell-wall thickness on the out-of-plane crashworthiness performance of the ripplecomb structure.

In this study, we implement semi-analytical and finite element approaches and conduct experimental impact tests to evaluate the performance of 3D printed lightweight sandwich panels with architected cellular cores of programmable six-sided cells. Changing the geometrical parameters of the cells leads to cellular cores of hexagonal, rectangular and auxetic topologies. A semi-analytical methodology is developed for conducting structural and low-velocity impact analyses based on a modified higher-order shear deformation theory. The standard mechanics homogenization is implemented through finite element modelling to accurately predict the effective mechanical properties of architected cellular cores. We apply explicit large deformation finite element analysis using ANSYS to analyze the elasto-plastic behavior of architected sandwich panels under a low-velocity impact. To experimentally corroborate the developed theoretical and computational models and to evaluate the manufacturability of the architected sandwich panels, we use the fused deposition modeling to 3D print samples of polylactic acid biopolymers. Uniaxial tensile test is first used to characterize the polymer. We then conduct low-velocity impact tests to investigate the energy absorption capability of architected sandwich panels. X-ray micro-tomography is finally employed to study the microstructural features of panels before and after the impact. The experimental and numerical results show that the auxetic sandwich panel is potentially an appropriate candidate for energy absorption applications due to its high-energy absorption capability and a minimum response force transferred from the 3D printed panel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Architected 3D printed sandwich panels; Cellular cores; Energy absorption; Low-velocity impact; Modified higher-order shear deformation theory","3D printers; Biomechanics; Biopolymers; Computation theory; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Energy absorption; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Microstructural evolution; Polymer blends; Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Tensile testing; Velocity; Cellular cores; Effective mechanical properties; Energy absorption capability; Fused deposition modeling; Higher order shear deformation theory; Large deformation finite elements; Low velocity impact; Sandwich panel; Finite element method","Schaedler, Tobias A., Architected Cellular Materials, Annual Review of Materials Research, 46, pp. 187-210, (2016); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels the Commonwealth and International Library Structures and Solid Body Mechanics Division, (2013); Akbarzadeh, Abdolhamid, Dynamic eigenstrain behavior of magnetoelastic functionally graded cellular cylinders, Composite Structures, 116, 1, pp. 404-413, (2014); Honeycomb Technology Materials Design Manufacturing Applications and Testing, (1997); Dinwiddie, Ralph B., Thermographic in-situ process monitoring of the electron beam melting technology used in additive manufacturing, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8705, (2013); Petras, A., Failure mode maps for honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 44, 4, pp. 237-252, (1999); Rathbun, Howard J., Performance of metallic honeycomb-core sandwich beams under shock loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 43, 6, pp. 1746-1763, (2006); Buitrago, Brenda L., Modelling of composite sandwich structures with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2090-2096, (2010); Masters, I.

One of the primary drivers for this growth is the increased freedom afforded to the design of both the external form and internal structure of fabricated parts. This freedom presents greater opportunities in optimising a parts mechanical properties, (such as strength, stiffness and mass), which in turn leads to enhanced performance whilst potentially reducing material use and hence, environmental impact. Realising this potential will further increase the viability of AM for a greater range of engineering contexts. Correspondingly, the contribution of this paper lies in the creation and validation of a method for the topological optimisation of the infill structure of fused deposition modelled (FDM) components. The proposed method uses results attained from finite element analysis (FEA) to influence the design of the internal structure (i.e. infill) by locally varying the composition of the infill based upon the associated stress values. This paper presents and discusses the proposed method, and demonstrates the generalisability of the method through its ability to handle complex geometries and loading conditions, and manufacturing process constraints. In addition, the paper validates the method through testing of FDM beams comprised of FEA influenced and standard honeycomb infill designs undergoing four different loading scenarios. The validation reveals that a three and a half times increase in strength can be achieved where the stress profiles are well defined within the structure. In addition, the FEA-influenced beams exhibited more consistent failure mode profiles, which maybe desirable for designing parts with specific failure mode characteristics. © 2017, The Author(s).","Finite element analysis (FEA); Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Infill; Internal geometry; Internal structure; Topology optimisation","","Printed to Life the Tipping Point, (2013); Fused Deposition Modeling Most Common 3D Printing Method, (2013); Rozvany, George I.N., A critical review of established methods of structural topology optimization, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 37, 3, pp. 217-237, (2009); Sigmund, Ole, Topology optimization approaches: A comparative review, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 48, 6, pp. 1031-1055, (2013); Deaton, Joshua D., A survey of structural and multidisciplinary continuum topology optimization: Post 2000, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 49, 1, pp. 1-38, (2014); Gopsill, James A., Deriving infill design of fused deposition modelled parts from predicted stress profiles, 2A-2016, (2016); Lu, Lin, Build-to-last: Strength to weight 3D printed objects, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 33, 4, (2014); Proceeding of the 7th Altair Cae Technology Conference, (2011); Meisel, Nicholas Alexander, An Investigation of Key Design for Additive Manufacturing Constraints in Multimaterial Three-Dimensional Printing, Journal of Mechanical Design, 137, 11, (2015); Ranscombe, Charlie, Visually decomposing vehicle images: Exploring the influence of different aesthetic features on consumer perception of brand, Design Studies, 33, 4, pp. 319-341, (2012)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The out-of-plane compressive properties of the Nomex honeycombs have been widely investigated under quasi-static and low strain rates (up to 300 s−1). There is a need to understand the behaviour of this structure under higher strain rate compression. This will widen the applicability of these structures to more areas such as debris impact and other impacts which induce high strain rates. This paper reports the out-of-plane compressive responses of Nomex honeycombs subject to quasi-static loading and high strain rate dynamic loading up to 1500 s−1. The work involves experimental measurements and numerical modelling and validation. The compressive responses of the honeycombs were measured using a sensitive magnesium alloy Kolsky bar setup with front and back face impacts. The failure modes of the Nomex honeycombs were identified to be different under quasi-static and dynamic compressions. Under quasi-static compression, the honeycombs failed with local phenolic resin fracture after the elastic buckling of the honeycomb walls. For the dynamic compression, the honeycombs failed with the stubbing of cell walls at the ends of specimens. A finite element (FE) numerical model was devised and validated with the experimental data. The FE model considered the strain rate effect of phenolic resin material. The model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental measurements and facilitated interpreting the out-of-plane compressive response of the Nomex honeycombs. It was shown that there was a linear compressive strength enhancement up to 30% from quasi-static to strain rate of 1500 s−1. The strength enhancement was governed by two mechanisms: the strain rate effect of the phenolic resin and inertial stabilization of the honeycomb unit cell walls, where 61%–74% of the enhancement was contributed by the inertial stabilization of the unit cell walls. In addition, it was shown that the impact method and initial imperfections had negligible effect on the compressive response of the Nomex honeycombs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic compression; Finite element analysis; Inertial stabilization; Nomex honeycombs; Strain rate effect","Aerospace applications; Compaction; Compressive strength; Dynamic loads; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Magnesium alloys; Numerical models; Resins; Stabilization; Stress-strain curves; Compressive properties; Dynamic compression; Experimental and numerical analysis; Modelling and validation; Nomex honeycombs; Quasi-static compression; Strain rate effect; Strain-rate compression; Strain rate","McShane, Graham J., The response of clamped sandwich plates with lattice cores subjected to shock loading, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 25, 2, pp. 215-229, (2006); Radford, Darren D., The response of clamped sandwich beams subjected to shock loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 6, pp. 968-987, (2006); Radford, Darren D., The response of clamped sandwich plates with metallic foam cores to simulated blast loading, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 43, 7-8, pp. 2243-2259, (2006); Uth, Tobias, Response of clamped sandwich beams subjected to high-velocity impact by sand slugs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 69, pp. 165-181, (2014); Fleck, Norman A., The resistance of clamped sandwich beams to shock loading, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 71, 3, pp. 386-401, (2004); Tao, Liu, The impact of sand slugs against beams and plates: Coupled discrete particle/finite element simulations, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 61, 8, pp. 1798-1821, (2013); Russell, Benjamin P., The soft impact of composite sandwich beams with a square-honeycomb core, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 48, pp. 65-81, (2012); Bourbigot, Serge, Heat resistance and flammability of high performance fibres: A review, Fire and Materials, 26, 4-5, pp. 155-168, (2002); Zhou, Jintang, Mechanical and thermal properties of graphene oxide/phenolic resin composite, Polymer Composites, 34, 8, pp. 1245-1249, (2013); In Proceedings of Iccm 12 Paris, (1999)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Rather than focusing on the existing perfect honeycomb, effects of concentrated filling inclusions on the in-plane dynamic behavior of circular honeycomb structure are studied in detail by using finite element simulations. The crushing model of honeycomb under in-plane impact is established which then is used to investigate the influences of packing ratio, defect distribution area and impact velocity on the deformation mode and the plateau stress. Investigation results show that the deformation model of imperfect honeycomb can still be classified into three types: Quasi-static mode, transition mode and dynamic mode; However, the value of packing ratio and defect location may seriously influence localized deformed band of transition mode; The plateau stress of the honeycomb relies on the defect location except for the packing ratio; The filling inclusions defect concentrated in sub-region 2 is more beneficial to improve the energy-absorption capacity; Especially under middle or low impact velocities, it displays higher sensitivity; The crushing plateau stress of honeycomb with α = 0.36 and defect concentrated in sub-region 2 is even improved about 56.9 % under impact velocity 100 m/s.

Static behaviour is studied to compare the top-roller diameter effect on the flexural behaviour of the panels and shows a significant difference in the results. Impact behaviour of the panels is explored using three different types of impactor end-shapes that generate different levels of damage in the material with the same level of impact energy. The second part of this paper deals with the development of numerical models for the three-point bend and impact behaviour of the panels using a commercial finite element code of Abaqus.

The quasi-static and dynamic compressive responses of three types of additively manufactured AlSi10Mg honeycomb structures, specifically a single-scale honeycomb and two hierarchical honeycombs with two and three levels of hierarchy, respectively, have been investigated using experimental measurement and finite element (FE) simulations. The validated FE simulation has been employed to investigate the effects of relative density of the honeycombs and the key experimental parameters. The following failure modes of the three types of honeycombs have been observed both under quasi-static and dynamic compression: (1) the single-scale honeycomb experienced a transition of failure mechanism from local plastic buckling of walls to local damage of the parent material without buckling with the increase of the relative density of the honeycomb; (2) the hierarchical honeycombs all failed with parent material damage without buckling at different relative densities. For both quasi-static and dynamic compression, the hierarchical honeycombs offer higher peak nominal wall stresses compared to the single-scale honeycomb at low relative density of ρ¯=0.19; the difference is diminished as relative density increases, i.e. the three types of honeycombs can achieve similar peak wall stresses when ρ¯⩾0.26. Numerical results have suggested the hierarchical honeycombs can offer better energy absorption capacity than the single-scale honeycomb. The two-scale and three-scale hierarchical honeycombs achieved similar peak nominal wall stresses for both quasi-static and dynamic compression, which may suggest that the structural performance under out-of-plane compression is not sensitive to the hierarchical architecture. This work indicates that the structural advantage of hierarchical honeycombs can be utilised to develop high performance lightweight structural components. © 2018 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis (FEA); Honeycomb; Impact behaviour; Mechanical properties","3D printers; Buckling; Dynamics; Finite element method; Mechanical properties; Energy absorption capacity; Experimental parameters; Finite element simulations; Hierarchical architectures; Honeycomb; Impact behaviour; Out-of-plane compression; Structural performance; Honeycomb structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Wicks, Nathan, Optimal truss plates, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 38, 30-31, pp. 5165-5183, (2001); Tao, Liu, Bi-functional optimization of actively cooled, pressurized hollow sandwich cylinders with prismatic cores, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2565-2602, (2007); Fleck, Norman A., Micro-architectured materials: Past, present and future, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 466, 2121, pp. 2495-2516, (2010); Fan, Hualin, Mechanical properties of hierarchical cellular materials.

Two types of composite prepreg were used to manufacture the core materials, these being a woven carbon fibre reinforced epoxy and a woven glass fibre reinforced epoxy. The resulting cores were of a high quality, exhibiting little or no wrinkling following the manufacturing procedure. Subsequent compression tests at quasi-static rates of loading showed that the compression strength of the core depended strongly on the level of constraint applied during testing, with sandwich panels based on composite skins bonded to an egg-box core offering a load-bearing capability that was more than double that of its unconstrained counterpart. The quasi-static compression strength of the carbon-based cores has been shown to be slightly higher than the glass fibre systems, particularly at higher core densities. Local splitting damage at cell joining regions and crushing of the cell of the egg-box structure was identified as the primary failure mechanism in the sandwich panels. Impact tests, conducted using a drop-weight impact tower, have shown that the compression strength of the egg-box cores is higher at dynamic rates of loading than at quasi-static rates. Here again, the local splitting and crushing was the primary mode of failure in the sandwich structures. Finally, the finite element technique has been used to model the mechanical response of these core designs under both quasi-static and impact loading testing conditions. Here, agreement between the predicted and observed responses was found to be good for both extremes of loading-rate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","A. carbon-fibre; A. glass fibre; B. impact behaviour; C. finite element analysis (FEA); Composite egg-box","Carbon fibers; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Coremaking; Crushing; Fiber reinforced materials; Fibers; Finite element method; Glass; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Load testing; Manufacture; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Thermoelectricity; Weaving; Compression strength; Compressive properties; Fibre-reinforced epoxy; Finite element techniques; Impact behaviour; Load bearing capabilities; Manufacturing procedure; Quasi-static compression; Structural design","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Engineering Mechanics of Composite Materials, (1994); Queheillalt, Douglas T., Pyramidal lattice truss structures with hollow trusses, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 397, 1-2, pp. 132-137, (2005); Zok, Frank W., Design of metallic textile core sandwich panels, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 40, 21, pp. 5707-5722, (2003); Chiras, Stefanie, The structural performance of near-optimized truss core panels, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, 15, pp. 4093-4115, (2002); Wang, J., On the performance of truss panels with Kagomé cores, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 40, 25, pp. 6981-6988, (2003); Xiong, Jian, Three-dimensional Composite Lattice Structures Fabricated by Electrical Discharge Machining, Experimental Mechanics, 54, 3, pp. 405-412, (2014); Yin, Sha, Compressive efficiency of stretch-stretch-hybrid hierarchical composite lattice cores, Materials and Design, 56, pp. 731-739, (2014); Kazemahvazi, Sohrab, Corrugated all-composite sandwich structures.

The present study aims to determine the sound insulation and excitation properties of such structured metal sheets and the parameters which characterize them. The bidirectional structure of the investigated steel sheets is derived from equilateral hexagons with a bulge, arranged in a honeycomb manner. The acoustic properties of these metal sheets are examined in terms of the driving-point mobility and the sound transmission loss by using the finite element method (up to 16 kHz) as well as laboratory experiments (up to 12.5 kHz). The study shows that the resulting driving-point mobility depends on frequency as well as on structure size. Additionally, it was found that the location of excitation has a notable impact on the resulting mobility spectra. The sound reduction index of the structured sheet metals is similar to that of a plane reference plate for low frequencies up to 4 kHz.

Drop-weight impact tests with different impact parameters, including impact energy, impactor mass and facesheets, were carried out on Nomex honeycomb-cored sandwich structures. It was found that the impact resistance and the penetration depth of the Nomex honeycomb sandwich structures were significantly influenced by the impact energy. However, for impact energies that cause full perforation, the impact resistance is characterized with almost the same initial stiffness and peak force. The impactor mass has little influence on the impact response and the perforation force is primarily dependent on the thickness of the facesheet, which generally varies linearly with it. In the numerical simulation, a comprehensive finite element model was developed which considers all the constituent materials of the Nomex honeycomb, i.e. aramid paper, phenolic resin, and the micro-structure of the honeycomb wall. The model was validated against the corresponding experimental results and then further applied to study the effects of various impact angles on the response of the honeycomb. It was found that both the impact resistance and the perforation depth are significantly influenced by the impact angle. The former increases with the obliquity, while the latter decreases with it. The orientation of the Nomex core has little effect on the impact response, while the angle between the impact direction and the fibre direction of the facesheets has a great influence on the impact response. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","fibre reinforced polymer facesheet; finite element; impact resistance; Nomex honeycomb sandwich; oblique angle","Bridge decks; Drops; Fatigue crack propagation; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Impact resistance; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Constituent materials; Drop weight impact; Fibre reinforced polymers; Finite element modelling; Initial stiffness; Nomex honeycombs; Oblique angles; Woven fabric composites; Aramid fibers","Kim, Chun-Gon, Impact Resistance of Composite Laminated Sandwich Plates, Journal of Composite Materials, 26, 15, pp. 2247-2261, (1992); Zhou, Gang, Damage characteristics of composite honeycomb sandwich panels in bending under quasi-static loading, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 8, 1, pp. 55-90, (2006); Abrate, Serge, Localized impact on sandwich structures with laminated facings, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 50, 2, pp. 69-82, (1997); Lacy, Thomas E., Numerical modeling of impact-damaged sandwich composites subjected to compression-after-impact loading, Composite Structures, 61, 1-2, pp. 115-128, (2003); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); NASA CR 2011 217157, (2011); Zinno, Alberto, Experimental characterization of phenolic-impregnated honeycomb sandwich structures for transportation vehicles, Composite Structures, 93, 11, pp. 2910-2924, (2011); Meo, Michele, Numerical simulations of low-velocity impact on an aircraft sandwich panel, Composite Structures, 62, 3-4, pp. 353-360, (2003); Manes, Andrea, Experimental and numerical investigations of low velocity impact on sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 99, pp. 8-18, (2013); Gilioli, Andrea, Compression after impact test (CAI) on NOMEX™ honeycomb sandwich panels with thin aluminum skins, Composites Part B: Engineering, 67, pp. 313-325, (2014)",""

During the manufacturing process and aircraft service life, low-velocity impacts from foreign objects (typically stones, tools and hails, etc.), would quite likely happen and could not be completely avoided. In order to evaluate the influence of low-velocity impact damage on titanium honeycomb sandwich structures, unidirectional in-plane compression tests on both intact and impact damaged sandwich panels were conducted to obtain their failure modes and compressive failure strength. Test results showed that the low-velocity impact damage could cause the change in failure modes and a 9% to 15% decrease in the compressive failure strength. Different impact energy levels showed a limited influence on the compressive failure strength. Numerical analysis was conducted to study the compression after impact behavior of titanium sandwich panels. Parametric finite element models that contained all the geometric and the structural details of honeycomb core cells, as well as the indentation and the crushed core region, were developed in the analysis. The numerical results successfully exhibited the failure process of the intact and impact damaged titanium sandwich panels subjected to unidirectional in-plane compression, similar to what observed in the tests.

However, the comprehensive study of the performance of chiral honeycomb under impact has not been studied to date. In this paper, firstly, the theoretical solution of yield stress for chiral honeycomb was obtained in terms of quasi-static loading. Thereafter, the in-plane dynamic crushing and energy-absorption capabilities of chiral honeycomb were studied numerically by means of finite element (FE) method. A comparative study between the chiral honeycomb and conventional hexagonal honeycomb was also performed to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two materials. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the effects of geometric topologies and impact scenarios on the response of chiral honeycomb. The numerical results show that the performance of plastic energy dissipation of chiral honeycomb is dependent not only on structural parameters but also on crushing velocities. The present study is committed to providing an important reference to the application of chiral honeycomb in the crashworthiness design. © 2018, © 2018 Korea Institute for Structural Maintenance and Inspection.","auxetics; Chiral honeycomb; energy absorption; finite element method; negative Poisson’s ratio","","Agnese, Fabio, Composite chiral shear vibration damper, Composite Structures, 132, pp. 215-225, (2015); Ajdari, Amin, Dynamic crushing and energy absorption of regular, irregular and functionally graded cellular structures, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 3-4, pp. 506-516, (2011); Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Alderson, Andrew, Auxetic materials, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 221, 4, pp. 565-575, (2007); Bettini, P., Composite chiral structures for morphing airfoils: Numerical analyses and development of a manufacturing process, Composites Part B: Engineering, 41, 2, pp. 133-147, (2010); Brighenti, Roberto, Smart behaviour of layered plates through the use of auxetic materials, Thin-Walled Structures, 84, pp. 432-442, (2014); Ebrahimi, Saeed, Multiobjective optimization and sensitivity analysis of honeycomb sandwich cylindrical columns under axial crushing loads, Thin-Walled Structures, 88, pp. 90-104, (2015); Ge, Zhaoyang, A finite element analysis of a 3D auxetic textile structure for composite reinforcement, Smart Materials and Structures, 22, 8, (2013); Hassan, Mohd Roshdi, Smart shape memory alloy chiral honeycomb, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 481-482, 1-2 C, pp. 654-657, (2008); Imbalzano, Gabriele, A numerical study of auxetic composite panels under blast loadings, Composite Structures, 135, pp. 339-352, (2016)",""

The sizes of the holes have been also evaluated by carrying out numerical thermal loading simulations on honeycomb sandwich specimen models impacted at high speed. The predictions provided by the Finite Elements and the analytical model give a good agreement with the results from the experimental tests.

The emphasis is directed to the procedures used to elaborate linear and nonlinear models and to predict dynamic response of the sandwich panels. Recently developed models are presented, which can be applied for structural health monitoring algorithms of real-scale sandwich panels. First, various popular theories of intact sandwich panels are briefly mentioned and a model is proposed to effectively analyse the modal dynamics of debonded and damaged (due to impact) sandwich panels. The influences of debonding size, form, and location and number of such damage incidents on the modal characteristics of sandwich panels are shown. For nonlinear analysis, models based on implicit and explicit time integration schemes are presented and dynamic responses gained with those models are discussed. Finally, questions related to debonding progression at the face sheet-core interface when dynamic loading continues with time are briefly highlighted. © © 2018 Vyacheslav N.

To improve the energy absorption performance of the energy-absorbing structure under an eccentric collision, in this paper, a FE model of the energy absorption structure for subway vehicles was created and validated by experimental data. Based on the validated FE model, the collision performances under a vertical offset of 0–80 mm and a horizontal offset of 0–40 mm are studied via simulation. The results show that the original structure is prone to instability when the horizontal offset is greater than 30 mm, so it is necessary to perform an optimization. Based on the bending strength, the cross-sectional shape of the guide was changed. The results show that there is no instability phenomenon in the improved structure I1 under all horizontal offsets. Under the horizontal offset of 40 mm, compared with the original structure, the energy absorption increased by 175.89%, and the peak force also increased by 14.46%. Based on the concept of gradient material, the honeycomb strength in the structure is changed into a gradient distribution, and the results show that the improved structure I2 also did not show any instability phenomenon under all horizontal offsets.

Local stress/strain calculation methods are applied to determine the initial crush stresses and the strain rates at initial crush from a cell-based finite element model of irregular honeycomb under dynamic loadings. The initial crush stress under constant-velocity compression is identical to the quasi-static one, but less than the one under direct impact, i.e. the initial crush stresses under different dynamic loadings could be very different even though there is no strain-rate effect of matrix material. A power-law relation between the initial crush stress and the strain rate is explored to describe the strain-rate effect on the initial crush stress of irregular honeycomb when the local strain rate exceeds a critical value, below which there is no strain-rate effect of irregular honeycomb. Deformation mechanisms of the initial crush behavior under dynamic loadings are also explored.

This study aimed to characterize the indentation and perforation behaviors of sandwich structures with different geometric configurations. The specimens with four characteristic geometric variables, namely, facesheet thickness, core height, honeycomb core thickness and side length of hexagon cell were tested experimentally. Photographs of cross-sectional view near the loading area and failure modes in the tests were investigated in detail. For the first time, digital image correlation (DIC) technique through an ARAMIS™ real-time optical strain measurement system was adopted for capturing the deformation process of lower skin by acquiring the displacement-time data. Three typical damage modes were identified from the force-displacement curves with different geometric parameters and configurations. It was found that the thickness of facesheet has the most significant effects on both force-displacement curves and energy absorption capacity. Changes in the core parameters have relatively small influences in total energy absorption but sizeable effects on the force-displacement curve and failure modes. A finite element model for predicting damage evolution was also developed and validated through the force-displacement relation and deformation process on the bottom skin. The damage mechanisms of the sandwich panel subject to quasi-static indentation and perforation were analyzed through the numerical models. The present study contributed on understanding how the geometric parameters affect the characteristics of indentation and perforation, thereby providing useful guidelines for its potential applications in impact engineering. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness; Digital image correlation (DIC); Failure modes; Finite element; Honeycomb core; Indentation tests; Sandwich panel","Crashworthiness; Deformation; Energy absorption; Failure modes; Finite element method; Geometry; Image analysis; Optical correlation; Sandwich structures; Strain measurement; Structural panels; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Energy absorption capacity; Energy absorption structure; Experimental and numerical studies; Force-displacement relations; Honeycomb core; Indentation test; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Ruan, Dong, Quasi-static indentation tests on aluminium foam sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2039-2046, (2010); Li, Xin, Dynamic behavior of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels under air blast: Experiment and numerical analysis, Composite Structures, 108, 1, pp. 1001-1008, (2014); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Wang, Dongmei, Impact behavior and energy absorption of paper honeycomb sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 110-114, (2009); Yang, Bin, Study on the low-velocity impact response and CAI behavior of foam-filled sandwich panels with hybrid facesheet, Composite Structures, 132, pp. 1129-1140, (2015); He, Wentao, Experimental and numerical research on the low velocity impact behavior of hybrid corrugated core sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 158, pp. 30-43, (2016); Kaman, Mete Onur, Experimental and numerical analysis of critical buckling load of honeycomb sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 44, 24, pp. 2819-2831, (2010); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); M S C E Thesis, (1987); Triantafillou, Thanasis C., Failure mode maps for foam core sandwich beams, Materials Science and Engineering, 95, C, pp. 37-53, (1987)",""

The changes of honeycomb geometry elements such as: fillets radius of the cell edges in the vicinity of hexagonal vertexes, wall thickness were considered. The computations were conducted by using finite element method with application of the ABAQUS finite element method environment. Elaborated numerical models allowed to demonstrate sensitivity of honeycomb structures damage process response to geometry element changes.

The effective crushing distance rate (ECDR) of this structure can exceed 1. During collision, the impact kinetic energy is dissipated by the elastic-plastic deformation of a steel plate and aluminium honeycomb. The bending theory of the steel plate is analysed to estimate the energy absorption (EA) and the mean crushing force (MCF). Then, a finite element (FE) model of the energy absorber is established, and its accuracy is validated by the theory of plate blending. When the plate thickness is 2 mm and 5 mm, the error between the simulation and theoretical results are 1.93% and 3.05%, respectively. The FE model is used to investigate the crashworthy performance. When the new absorber is deformed, the influence of the type of aluminium honeycomb, steel plate thickness and width, guide wheel radius, and number of guide wheels on energy absorption are analysed. Aluminium honeycomb with appropriate parameters can significantly reduce the peak crushing force (PCF) by up to 60.8%. The crushing force (CF) and EA increase as the plate thickness, plate width, and number of guide wheels increase but decreases as the guide wheel radius decreases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bending-straightening; Energy absorption; Large compression stroke; Steel plate","Aluminum; Blending; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Elastoplasticity; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Sandwich structures; Wheels; Aluminium honeycomb; Bending theory; Compression stroke; Elastic-plastic deformation; Energy absorbers; Larger deformations; Plate thickness; Steel plates; Plates (structural components)","Fleming, Nic, Morphing cars protect pedestrians from collisions, New Scientist, 202, 2704, pp. 18-19, (2009); Baykasoglu, C., Railroad passenger car collision analysis and modifications for improved crashworthiness, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 16, 3, pp. 319-329, (2011); Tehrani, P.

The dynamic behaviours of these structures are numerically investigated, taking into account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson-Cook model is employed to describe the dynamic responses of the composite sandwiches subjected to high strain-rate loadings. Analytical models are derived correlating unit cell geometrical parameters and crushing strengths of the representative panels at different impact velocities. Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the performances of different sandwich panel designs under impulsive loadings. In particular, transmitted reaction forces and maximum stresses on the protected structure are quantified for various design parameters including the geometrical factors and the effective Poisson's ratios. A quarter of the panel is symmetrically modelled with shell elements and the CONWEP model is used to simulate the blast loading.

The experiments were carried out by a single-stage gas gun system and numerical simulations were performed using the explicit finite element code, LS-DYNA®. The mechanical properties of the functionally graded face sheets through the thickness were considered in accordance with a power-law distribution. The Mori–Tanaka scheme was used in order to determine the effective material properties of the functionally graded face sheets at a local point. In order to simulate the elastoplastic behavior of the functionally graded face sheets, Tamura–Tomota–Ozawa model was implemented in the numerical model. The ballistic performance of the sandwich structure was investigated for metal-rich (n = 0.1), linear (n = 1.0), and ceramic-rich (n = 10.0) compositions of the functionally graded face sheets. The results indicated that the ceramic fraction of the functionally graded face sheets was quite influential on energy absorption capability, damage mechanism, and impact resistance of the sandwich structure.

This study aims to examine the performance of a new protective system utilizing auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels for mitigation of shock loads from close-in and contact detonations of high explosives. Both field blast tests and drop weight tests were performed using the proposed sandwiches as a shield for concrete panels in combination with conventional steel protective plates. The combined shield was found to be effective in protecting reinforced concrete structures against severe impact and close-in blast loadings. The honeycomb core with re-entrant hexagonal cells shows evident auxetic characteristics which contribute substantially to outstanding force mitigation and blast-resistance performances of such sandwich panels. Numerical simulations showed good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed auxetic panels were found to perform better than conventional honeycomb panels of the same size, areal density and material. Both were found to boost the energy absorption of the monolithic steel plate by a factor of 2.5 by changing its deformation pattern under close-in blast loading. In addition, a combination of the steel plate and an auxetic sandwich panel has aerial specific energy absorption (ASEA) higher than either of them, showing great potential for the development of lightweight blast protection of civil, mining, military, nuclear infrastructure and vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic; Blast loading; Close-in detonation; Finite element; Impact; Negative Poisson's ratio; Sandwich","","Remennikov, Alex M., Experimental investigation and simplified modeling of response of steel plates subjected to close-in blast loading from spherical liquid explosive charges, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 101, pp. 78-89, (2017); Guruprasad, Siddalingappa, Layered sacrificial claddings under blast loading.

Compressive experiments on the perforated honeycombs with different cell numbers are conducted to study the effect of specimen sizes. The measured collapse stress is almost insensitive to the specimen sizes, while the crushing stress increases with the cell numbers and finally converges to a stable plateau for the specimens beyond 15 × 15 cells. Finite element simulations are performed to study the effects of perforation size, spacing and shape on the mechanical properties of honeycombs. The results reveal that perforation size is a key parameter that affects the compressive mechanical properties and deformation patterns of honeycombs. The perforation number along the height direction of a cell has nearly no influence on the collapse stress, and only affect the crushing stress when the perforation size is large. The perforation shape impacts the collapse of honeycombs but has minor effect on the subsequent crushing stage. © 2017","Collapse; Crush; Hexagonal honeycomb; Perforation; Size effect","Aluminum; Biomechanics; Cells; Crushing; Cytology; Finite element method; Mechanical properties; Well perforation; Collapse; Compressive behavior; Compressive experiment; Compressive mechanical properties; Finite element simulations; Hexagonal honeycomb; Numerical investigations; Size effects; Honeycomb structures","Aktay, Levent, Numerical modelling of honeycomb core crush behaviour, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, 9, pp. 2616-2630, (2008); Alavi, Ali, An experimental investigation on the effect of strain rate on the behaviour of bare and foam-filled aluminium honeycombs, Materials and Design, 52, pp. 748-756, (2013); Caccese, Vincent, Optimal design of honeycomb material used to mitigate head impact, Composite Structures, 100, pp. 404-412, (2013); Chen, Yong, Crush dynamics of square honeycomb thin rubber wall, Thin-Walled Structures, 47, 12, pp. 1447-1456, (2009); Deqiang, Sun, Mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses of hexagonal honeycomb cores under impact loadings, Composite Structures, 92, 11, pp. 2609-2621, (2010); Feng, Jiang, Oblique incidence performance of radar absorbing honeycombs, Composites Part B: Engineering, 99, pp. 465-471, (2016); Foo, Choon Chiang, Mechanical properties of Nomex material and Nomex honeycomb structure, Composite Structures, 80, 4, pp. 588-594, (2007); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Goldsmith, Werner, An experimental study of energy absorption in impact on sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 12, 2, pp. 241-262, (1992); Grédiac, Michel M., A finite element study of the transverse shear in honeycomb cores, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 30, 13, pp. 1777-1788, (1993)",""

A Schapery theory based constitutive model, which takes account of intra-ply shear inelasticity and fiber kinking and resulting fracture is developed for the impacted plain weave fabric laminated face-sheets under compression loading. Each ply of the face-sheets is modeled as an orthotropic nonlinear elastic lamina degrading as characterized through laboratory experiments. The behavior of woven plies in the warp and fill directions is elastic until the attainment of local instability in compression. The phenomenon of fiber micro-buckling leading to kink banding, which was observed to be the mechanism controlling failure of the impacted face-sheets and hence the sandwich panels, is explicitly accounted for by allowing the fiber rotation at a material point. In the shear direction, plasticity is also considered to represent the elastic-plastic in-plane shear behavior of woven fabric plies. The constitutive model is numerically implemented using the commercially available finite element package ABAQUS through a user defined material subroutine (UMAT). The previous 3D damaged FE model which was proven to accurately capture the low–velocity impact damages is imported and subjected to a compression loading modeling. The numerical results in terms of deformation, failure mode and residual strength show a remarkable agreement with experimentally measured ones, allowing the model to be validated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Compression-after-impact; Kink banding; Progressive damage; Sandwich panels; Schapery theory","ABAQUS; Constitutive models; Elastoplasticity; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Weaving; Compression after impact; Kink banding; Progressive damage; Sandwich panel; Schapery theory; Buckling","Damage Resistance and Damage Tolerance of Thin Composite Facesheet Honeycomb Panels, (1989); Impact and Post Impact Response of Graphite Epoxy and Kevlar Epoxy Structures, (1987); Kassapoǵlou, Christos, Compression strength of composite sandwich structures after barely visible impact damage, Journal of Composites Technology and Research, 18, 4, pp. 274-284, (1996); Proceedings of the AIAA ASME ASCE AHS ASC 32nd Structures Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, (1991); Damage Tolerance of Composite Sandwich Structures, (2000); Impact Resistance and Damage Tolerance of Composite Sandwich Panels, (1994); Test and Analysis of Composite Sandwich Panels with Impact Damage, (2002); Xie, Zonghong, Damage propagation in a composite sandwich panel subjected to increasing uniaxial compression after low-velocity impact, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 7, 4, pp. 269-288, (2005); Xie, Zonghong, A feasible methodology for engineering applications in damage tolerance of composite sandwich structures, Journal of Composite Materials, 38, 11, pp. 891-914, (2004); Davies, Glyn A.O., Compression after impact strength of composite sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 63, 1, pp. 1-9, (2004)",""

Simulation results indicate that the defect location has a great influence on the deformation modes, especially at low and moderate velocity. After analyzing the apparent reflection about dynamic response at the impact end, the respective influences of local fraction of inclusions and foil thickness (relative density) on the crushing plateau stress on account of the crushing velocity are further discussed.

It is shown that the dynamic out-of-plane compaction of honeycombs does not obey the law of shock wave propagation and a new phenomenological model of the velocity attenuation is proposed. It is revealed that the absorbed energy by the honeycomb is proportional to the area under the dynamic stress-strain curve, which is defined by the foil material properties, in contrast to the shock-wave propagation model where the absorbed energy is proportional to the area under the shock chord.

The current Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) materials are weak in water resistance and durability, expensive in acquiring and installing, and have negative environmental impacts. So it is significantly required to find a new alternative material with good mechanical properties, higher arresting coefficient and excellent environmental performance. In this article, the arresting properties of metal honeycomb material are studied. A Tire-Honeycomb material Interaction Mechanical Model (THIMM) is proposed. Combining with the dynamic model of aircraft, the theoretical model is coded by MATLAB to finish arresting simulation on aircraft B737-900ER and B727-100. In addition, finite element model of the tire-honeycomb material interaction was built to verify the correctness of the theoretical model. The results obtained by finite element simulation are in a good agreement with the theoretical results. In comparison with the results for traditional materials, the calculated results show that the honeycomb material can stop the overrunning aircraft more efficiently in the condition that the forces induced by the stopping process are safe for the passengers and aircraft. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Arresting system; Civil aircraft; Energy absorption; Honeycomb material; THIMM","Aircraft; Aircraft accidents; Aircraft materials; Electric resistance; Energy absorption; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Honeycomb structures; MATLAB; Alternative materials; Arresting system; Civil aircrafts; Environmental performance; Finite element simulations; Honeycomb materials; THIMM; Traditional materials; Finite element method","Arnaldo Valdés, Rosa María, The development of probabilistic models to estimate accident risk (due to runway overrun and landing undershoot) applicable to the design and construction of runway safety areas, Safety Science, 49, 5, pp. 633-650, (2011); Ayres, Manuel, Modelling the location and consequences of aircraft accidents, Safety Science, 51, 1, pp. 178-186, (2013); undefined; Air Force Civil Engineer Magazine, (1993); undefined, (2005); Development of A Soft Ground Arrestor System, (2008); Soft Ground Arresting of Civil Aircraft, (1968); Royal Aircraft Establishment Technical Memorandum Naval, (1970); Royal Aircraft Establishment Technical Report 71015, (1971); Development of A Model Technique for Investigating the Performance of Soft Ground Arresters for Aircraft, (1971)",""

The proposed CBF consists of a special force transition section, a beam system structure upper steel bucket cover and a large-scale steel bucket with honeycomb structure rooms. It can be prefabricated onshore, self-floated on the sea and then towed to the appointed sea area before sinking to the sea soil under negative pressure. This is called the ""one-step"" installation technology. Arc- and line-type bucket foundations are calculated by both theory and the finite element method to discuss their force transfer paths and bearing modes. Owning to the special structural form, the transition section can effectively convert the huge load and bending moment into controllable tension and compressive stress, as well as adjust the structure balance. The bearing model and percentage of each part of the composite foundation under monotonous and ultimate load conditions are also calculated. Results indicate that the bearing mode of CBF is a typical top cover mode.

The respective influences of hierarchical parameters, bulk materials, and impact velocities on the macro-/micro-deformation behaviors, the dynamic strength, and the specific absorbed energy of hierarchical honeycombs are explored in detail. The results show that the crushing strengths and energy-absorbing capacities of honeycombs significantly improve when adding the hierarchy into conventional cellular structures.

In this study, sandwich panels of 1.6 m x 1.3 m were subjected to 30 kg charges of C4 explosive at stand-off distances from 8 m to 16 m. These targets formed part of two studies presented here: one, to observe the loading of the same geometry of target to an increasing shock intensity; and the second, to observe the response of one target to multiple blast impacts. Experimental data provides detailed data for sandwich panel response, which are often used in civil and military structures, where air-blast loading represents a serious threat. High-speed photography, with digital image correlation (DIC), and laser gauge systems were employed to monitor the deformation of these structures during the blasts. The experimental data provides for the development of analytical and computational models.

To impact on this trend, it is essential to develop our understanding about the role of microstructure on mechanical responses of these structures. Although a large literature exists on the general subject, the role of microstructure on the post-yield instability is not yet adequately documented. This research introduces a numerical approach to study the post-yield instability in 2D infinite honeycombs as a bottleneck for understanding the instability in more complex 3D systems. Two distinct algorithms are used to systematically vary the ordering in the microstructure of regular hexagonal honeycombs and the mean cell size in the microstructure of Voronoi honeycombs. Finite elements together with a nonlinear homogenization technique are incorporated to quantify the instability responses. Finally, the contribution of microstructure on initial post-yield instability—the slope and magnitude of stress drop after yielding—is statistically investigated. It is found that changing the degree of ordering in the microstructure with respect to a parent symmetry can systematically vary the post-yield instability properties. However, systematic variation of the cell size distribution in absence of ordering in the microstructure cannot remarkably change the post-yield instability in the meta-material. Instead, a tailored cell size distribution can systematically influence its yield strength and plateau stress. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.","","Biomimetic materials; Biomimetics; Cells; Cellular manufacturing; Cytology; Homogenization method; Honeycomb structures; Metamaterials; Microstructure; Size distribution; Stability; Biomimetic structures; Cell size distribution; Manufacturing techniques; Mechanical response; Micro architectures; Nonlinear homogenization; Numerical approaches; Systematic variation; Yield stress","Rhee, Hongjoo, A study on the structure and mechanical behavior of the Dasypus novemcinctus shell, Materials Science and Engineering C, 31, 2, pp. 363-369, (2011); Seki, Yasuaki, Structure and mechanical behavior of a toucan beak, Acta Materialia, 53, 20, pp. 5281-5296, (2005); Arnoldia, (2012); Shanks, Robert A., Editorial corner - A personal view: Biomimetic materials: A challenge for nano-scale self-assembly, Express Polymer Letters, 8, 8, (2014); Li, Jianrong, Effect of dual-size cell mix on the stiffness and strength of open-cell aluminum foams, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 362, 1-2, pp. 240-248, (2003); Ashby, Michael F.A., The properties of foams and lattices, Philosophical transactions.

Hence, it is important to consider how each structural component deforms in order to control the passenger compartment deceleration. In frontal impact tests, the passenger compartment deceleration depends on the energy absorption property of the front structures. However, at this point in time there are few papers describing the components' quantitative contributions on the passenger compartment deceleration. Generally, the cross-sectional force is used to examine each component's contribution to passenger compartment deceleration. However, it is difficult to determine each component's contribution based on the cross-sectional forces, especially within segments of the individual members itself such as the front rails, because the force is transmitted continuously and the cross-sectional forces remain the same through the component. Method: The deceleration of a particle can be determined from the derivative of the kinetic energy. Using this energy-derivative method, the contribution of each component on the passenger compartment deceleration can be determined. Using finite element (FE) car models, this method was applied for full-width and offset impact tests. This method was also applied to evaluate the deceleration of the powertrain. The finite impulse response (FIR) coefficient of the vehicle deceleration (input) and the driver chest deceleration (output) was calculated from Japan New Car Assessment Program (JNCAP) tests. These were applied to the component's contribution on the vehicle deceleration in FE analysis, and the component's contribution to the deceleration of the driver's chest was determined. Result: The sum of the contribution of each component coincides with the passenger compartment deceleration in all types of impacts; therefore, the validity of this method was confirmed. In the full-width impact, the contribution of the crush box was large in the initial phases, and the contribution of the passenger compartment was large in the final phases. For the powertrain deceleration, the crush box had a positive contribution and the passenger compartment had a negative contribution. In the offset test, the contribution of the honeycomb and the passenger compartment deformation to the passenger compartment deceleration was large. Based on the FIR analysis, the passenger compartment deformation contributed the most to the chest deceleration of the driver dummy in the full-width impact. Conclusions: Based on the energy-derivative method, the contribution of the components' deformation to deceleration of the passenger compartment can be calculated for various types of crash configurations more easily, directly, and quantitatively than by using conventional methods. In addition, by combining the energy-derivative method and FIR, each structure's contribution to the occupant deceleration can be obtained. The energy-derivative method is useful in investigating how the deceleration develops from component deformations and also in designing deceleration curves for various impact configurations. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","acceleration control; Crashworthiness; finite element method; finite impulse response; front impact; vehicle design","calculation; deceleration; driver; finite element analysis; human; Japan; quantitative study; thorax; validity; kinetics; motor vehicle; physiology; reproducibility; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Deceleration; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Kinetics; Motor Vehicles; Reproducibility of Results; Thorax","Estimation of the Benefits for Potential Options to Modify Unece Regulation no 94 to Improve A Car S Compatibility; Thoracic Injury Prediction Via Digital Convolution Theory, (1981); Eevc Approach to Develop Test Procedure S for the Improvement of Crash Compatibility Between Passenger Cars; Fang, Howie, A comparative study of metamodeling methods for multiobjective crashworthiness optimization, Computers and Structures, 83, 25-26, pp. 2121-2136, (2005); Ls Dyna Keyword User S Manual Livermore Software Technology Corporation, (2007); Huang, Matthew, Vehicle crash mechanics, pp. 1-482, (2002); Johannsen, Heiko, Proposal for a Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Approach Based on the European FIMCAR Project, Traffic Injury Prevention, 14, SUPPL1, pp. S105-S115, (2013); Structural Interaction Between Vehicles Thesis, (2014); Liao, Xingtao, A two-stage multi-objective optimisation of vehicle crashworthiness under frontal impact, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 13, 3, pp. 279-288, (2008); Lstc Barrier Models, (2014)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

In conjunction with experimental and numerical methods, analytical models of indentation response and energy balance specifically aimed to solve problems of low-velocity impact of a spherical indenter on sandwich panels were deduced. Results show that a hemispherical residual dent caused by bending of top face-sheet and core crushing is left on top face-sheet after impact. It also concludes that more than 80% of impact energy is absorbed mostly by top face-sheet and honeycomb core. The main form of energy dissipation is plastic dissipation. In addition, parametric studies were carried out to explore effects of impact energy on impact behavior by altering impact velocity or impactor mass.

Parametric analyses are conducted to assess the performance of different designs of the hybrid composite structures. The results are compared with monolithic panels of equivalent areal mass and material in terms of deformations and plastic energy dissipation. Design parameters considered for the parametric analyses include the auxetic unit cell effective Poisson’s ratio, thickness of the facet, material properties and radius of the unit cell’s struts. Significant reduction in computational time is achieved by modelling a quarter of the panel, with shell elements for facets and beam elements for the auxetic core. With projectile impacts up to 200 m/s, the auxetic composite panels are found to be able to absorb a similar amount of energy through plastic deformation, while the maximum back facet displacements are reduced up to 56% due to localised densification and plastic deformation of the auxetic core. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Auxetic composite; composite sandwich; finite element simulation; impact resistance; negative Poisson’s ratio","Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Impact resistance; Plastic deformation; Sandwich structures; Strain rate; Structure (composition); Auxetic composites; Composite sandwiches; Finite element simulations; Parametric -analysis; Plastic energy dissipation; Rate-dependent effects; S ratio; Three dimensional modelling; Finite element method","Zaera, R., Ballistic impacts on polymer matrix composites, composite armor, personal armor, CISM International Centre for Mechanical Sciences, Courses and Lectures, 526, pp. 305-403, (2011); Qi, Chang, Blast resistance and multi-objective optimization of aluminum foam-cored sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 105, pp. 45-57, (2013); Ghazlan, Abdallah, Influence of interfacial geometry on the energy absorption capacity and load sharing mechanisms of nacreous composite shells, Composite Structures, 132, pp. 299-309, (2015); Tran, Phuong, Bio-inspired composite structures subjected to underwater impulsive loading, Computational Materials Science, 82, pp. 134-139, (2014); Burns, Stephen J., Negative Poisson's ratio materials, Science, 238, 4826, (1987); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Alderson, Andrew, Auxetic materials, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 221, 4, pp. 565-575, (2007); Evans, Ken E., Auxetic materials: Functional materials and structures from lateral thinking!, Advanced Materials, 12, 9, pp. 617-628, (2000); Argatov, Ivan I., On local indentation and impact compliance of isotropic auxetic materials from the continuum mechanics viewpoint, International Journal of Engineering Science, 54, pp. 42-57, (2012); Pasternak, Elena G., Materials and structures with macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio, International Journal of Engineering Science, 52, pp. 103-114, (2012)",""

However, studies on such structures have been mainly limited to metallic honeycombs with little research done on polymeric honeycomb structures. The purpose of this paper is to study the in-plane static compressive crushing behaviour and energy absorption capacity of 3D printed polymeric honeycomb structures of different unit cell thicknesses. Uniaxial quasi-static compression tests were performed on hexagonal honeycomb structures of varying wall thicknesses printed in Nylon 12 by fused deposition modelling 3D printing. Numerical simulations using ABAQUS/Explicit finite element analysis software were performed to determine the compressive behaviour of the same honeycomb structures. Gibson and Ashby’s analytical model was also used to determine the theoretical plateau stresses of the honeycombs. The experimental compressive behaviour, plateau stress and energy absorption capacity of the honeycombs were compared with numerical and analytical values.

Several configurations, involving two different core heights and two or three layered skins were investigated in order to find the best one in terms of impact energy absorption. Several criteria were used to evaluate the behavior of specimens subjected to low velocity impact: damage of the core following the impact, behavior of core at impact, possible penetration of the skin, variation of impact force in time during impact and type of force drop, and, finally, the average impact force, defined as the total absorbed strain energy divided by the tup displacement. Conclusions were drawn following the recording of the variation of the impact force and strain energy of the specimens in drop-weight tests with different impact speeds. Finally, a numerical study using the finite element method was undertaken in order to understand the impact process and to verify the correctness of the experimental results. For this, one of the studied specimens was modeled and impact was simulated in the same conditions as the ones used in the experimental program. The variation of the impact force in time was obtained numerically and compared with the experimental data, showing a good agreement.","Finite element; Honeycomb core; Impact; Sandwich structure; Strain energy","","undefined; Wilbert, A., Buckling and progressive crushing of laterally loaded honeycomb, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48, 5, pp. 803-816, (2011); Aminanda, Yulfian, Experimental analysis and modeling of the crushing of honeycomb cores, Applied Composite Materials, 12, 3-4, pp. 213-227, (2005); Meo, Michele, The response of honeycomb sandwich panels under low-velocity impact loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 47, 9, pp. 1301-1325, (2005); Yamashita, Minoru, Impact behavior of honeycomb structures with various cell specifications - Numerical simulation and experiment, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 618-630, (2005); Chawla, Anoop, Prediction of crushing behaviour of honeycomb structures, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 8, 3, pp. 229-235, (2003); Griškevičius, Paulius, Experimental and numerical study of impact energy absorption of safety important honeycomb core sandwich structures, Medziagotyra, 16, 2, pp. 119-123, (2010); Wang, Dongmei, Impact behavior and energy absorption of paper honeycomb sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 36, 1, pp. 110-114, (2009); Foo, Choon Chiang, Low-velocity impact failure of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 85, 1, pp. 20-28, (2008); Dear, John P., Impact damage processes in composite sheet and sandwich honeycomb materials, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 130-154, (2005)",""

Applying the theory of micro-perforated panel (MPP), we establish a theoretical method to calculate the sound absorption coefficient of this new kind of metamaterial. Perfect sound absorption is found at just a few hundreds hertz with two-octave 0.5 absorption bandwidth. To verify this model, a finite element model is developed to calculate the absorption coefficient and analyze the viscous-thermal energy dissipation. It is found that viscous energy dissipation at perforation regions dominates the total energy consumed.

Gas gun impact tests were conducted to investigate the high velocity impact response of the panels subjected to the impact from a steel ball bearing at an impact velocity of around 210 m/s. The effect of the thickness of the foam core and FML skin on the impact resistance of the panels is also investigated via experimental study. A finite element model is developed for effective numerical modelling of the impact behaviour of the sandwich panels using the commercially finite element software ANSYS LS-DYNA for more extensive study of the impact response of the sandwich panels. The simplified Johnson Cook material model, the composite damage material model based on the Chang-Chang criteria, and the crushable foam material model are used to model the aluminium sheets, composite plies and the AL foam respectively. Three types of contact algorithms, i.e. the erosion contact type, the tie-break contact type and the general 3D contact type are employed to define the various contacts during the impact and to model the delamination between the FML layers and debonding between the FML skin and the AL foam. The finite element model is validated by comparing the simulated impact behaviour to that from experimental for a sandwich panel subjected to high speed impact and demonstrated to be effective and accurate. The effect of the shape of projectile and impact angle on the impact behaviour of the sandwich panels is studied using the developed finite element model.

To manufacture durable composites parts, understanding their structural behavior under severe loading conditions is critical to designers and end-users. FRPs usually demonstrate a multiplicity of damage mechanisms under varying impact conditions due to their heterogeneous microstructure. A wealth of knowledge is available on a low-velocity impact response of composites, though with continuously emerging advanced materials and structures, established structure-property-performance relationships that could provide guidelines on dynamic impact behavior of composites are rare. A compulsory compliance with extensive testing standards and affirmation to the personnel health and safety makes real-time dynamic impact experiments rather expensive. Repeatability and reliability of their results may also suffer due to the rapid time frame in the absence of a suitable data-acquisition system. Finite-element (FE) models, in such cases, can be used as a virtual simulation tool to help engineers improving design of composite structures exposed to dynamic loading. This chapter is focused on providing insight into the low to high-velocity impact performance of FRPs, with an emphasis on FE modeling of high-velocity impact events. Three case studies - ballistic-impact performance of woven hybrid composite laminates, a blast response of curved carbon fiber-reinforced (CFRP) laminates and hypervelocity impact behavior of a CFRP/Al honeycomb sandwich panel - are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Ballistic limit; Blast; Cfrp; Damage; Dynamic load; Experiment; Fiber-reinforced polymer composites; Finite-element; Hypervelocity; Impact; Sandwich panel; Woven hybrid composite laminates","","Olsson, Robin, Mass criterion for wave controlled impact response of composite plates, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 31, 8, pp. 879-887, (2000); Sjöblom, Peter O.W., On Low-Velocity Impact Testing of Composite Materials, Journal of Composite Materials, 22, 1, pp. 30-52, (1988); Cantwell, Wesley J., The impact resistance of composite materials - a review, Composites, 22, 5, pp. 347-362, (1991); Liu, Dahsin H., Matrix Cracking in Impacted Glass/Epoxy Plates, Journal of Composite Materials, 21, 7, pp. 594-609, (1987); Abrate, Serge, Impact on laminated composite materials, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 44, 4, pp. 155-190, (1991); Impact Engineering of Composite Structures, (2011); Richardson, Melvin O.W., Review of low-velocity impact properties of composite materials, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 27, 12 PART A, pp. 1123-1131, (1996); Dynamic Deformation Damage and Fracture in Composite Materials and Structures, (2016); Tekalur, Srinivasan Arjun, Mechanical behavior and damage evolution in E-glass vinyl ester and carbon composites subjected to static and blast loads, Composites Part B: Engineering, 39, 1, pp. 57-65, (2008); LeBlanc, James M., Dynamic response of curved composite panels to underwater explosive loading: Experimental and computational comparisons, Composite Structures, 93, 11, pp. 3072-3081, (2011)",""

A method based on the cross-sectional engineering stress is developed to obtain the one-dimensional stress distribution along the loading direction in a cellular specimen. The cross-sectional engineering stress is contributed by two parts: the node-transitive stress and the contact-induced stress, which are caused by the nodal force and the contact of cell walls, respectively. It is found that the contactinduced stress is dominant for the significantly enhanced stress behind the shock front. The stress enhancement and the compaction wave propagation can be observed through the stress distributions in honeycombs under high-velocity compression. The single and double compaction wave modes are observed directly from the stress distributions. Theoretical analysis of the compaction wave propagation in the density-graded honeycombs based on the R-PH (rigid–plastic hardening) idealization is carried out and verified by the numerical simulations. It is found that stress distribution in cellular materials and the compaction wave propagation characteristics under dynamic compression can be approximately predicted by the R-PH shock model. © 2017, (publisher Name).

The roof section, framed by a grid of ribs, was originally constructed of a single honeycomb core/composite face sheet sandwich panel. The original panel has acoustic coincidence frequencies near 600 Hz, leading to poor TL across the frequency range of 1-4 kHz. To quiet the panel, the cross section was split into two thinner sandwich subpanels separated by an air gap. The air gap was sized to target the fundamental mass-spring-mass resonance of the panel system to less than 500 Hz, well below the frequency range of interest. The panels were designed to withstand structural loading from normal rotorcraft operation, as well as ""man-on-the-roof"" static loads experienced during maintenance operations. Thin layers of viscoelastomer were included in the face sheet ply layups, increasing panel damping loss factors from about 0.01 to 0.05. TL measurements show the optimized panel provides 6-11 dB of acoustic TL improvement and 6-15 dB of structure-borne sound reduction at critical rotorcraft transmission tonal frequencies. Analytic panel TL theory simulates the measured performance within 3 dB over most frequencies. Detailed finite element/boundary element modeling simulates TL slightly more accurately, within 2 dB for frequencies up to 4 kHz, and also simulates structure-borne sound well, generally within 3 dB. © 2017 AHS International.","","Acoustic wave transmission; Aircraft; Honeycomb structures; Rotors; Sandwich structures; Speech communication; Speech intelligibility; Speech transmission; Composite sandwich panels; Damping loss factor; Frequency ranges; Honeycomb core; Maintenance operations; Sound power transmission; Structural loading; Structure borne sound; Roofs","Hambric, Stephen A., Simulations and measurements of the vibroacoustic effects of replacing rolling element bearings with journal bearings in a simple gearbox, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 135, 3, (2013); Proceedings of Noise Con, (2004); NASA CR 2015 218769, (2015); Internoise, (1999); Davis, Evan B., Designing honeycomb panels for noise control, pp. 729-801, (1999); Peters, Portia R., Sound transmission loss of damped honeycomb sandwich panels, 5, pp. 3220-3229, (2006); Honeycomb Plate Properties Finite Element Modeling Continuous Improvement the Book Code 542 E Book NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt MD; Proceedings of Novem 2015, (2015); Zhou, Ran, Boundary element analyses for sound transmission loss of panels, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 127, 2, pp. 829-840, (2010); Designing Quiet Structures A Sound Power Minimization Approach, (1997)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

This paper introduces a novel configuration, namely double functionally graded (DFG) structure, which comprises of a functionally graded honeycomb filler in a functionally graded thickness (FGT) tube. Based on the validated finite element (FE) models, a comparative study on the DFG tube, single functionally graded (SFG) tube, and traditional uniform honeycomb filled uniform thickness (H-UT) tube were carried out to explore the crashing behaviors of different structures under multiple load cases. It is found that as crushing displacement increases, DFG structure exhibits superior capacity of energy absorption over other configurations and this trend is positively related to the impact angles. In addition, the comparisons of deformation modes and critical crushing angles clearly indicate that the DFG structure is of better and more stable crashing characteristics, being a crashworthy structure. Following the configurational comparison, further parametric studies on the DFG structures were conducted to explore the effects of tubal thickness range and honeycomb thickness range on the crashworthiness. It is found that the tube thickness range is more important to crashworthiness, which provides a basis for structural optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Composite structure; Energy absorption; Functionally-graded honeycomb; Functionally-graded thickness","Accidents; Composite structures; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Energy absorption; Fillers; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Structural optimization; Tubes (components); Absorbing devices; Capacity of energies; Cellular material; Comparative studies; Different structure; Functionally graded; Honeycomb thickness; Multiple load case; Structural design","Alexander, J.

The honeycomb structures with thicker walls have a higher plateau force and specific energy absorption (SEA) under the compression loading. Deformation modes and deflections distribution along the axis direction caused by plastic stretching and bending were investigated in detail to have a better understanding of the deformation mechanism. Results show that the sandwich structures have a higher ability of resisting deformation along the longitudinal(Y)-direction than the transverse(X)-direction. In addition, the dynamic responses of honeycomb sandwich structures with different stand-off distances, graded cores and arranged orientations were studied. Results show that both the graded honeycomb cores and cross-arranged honeycomb cores can significantly improve the resistance ability of the sandwich structures under blast loading, compared with the ungraded honeycomb cores and regular-arranged cores. Comprehensively, the cross-arranged graded honeycomb cores with higher density of the upper layer performs the best under the blast loading compared with the other configurations, taking the effects of graded cores and arranged orientations into consideration.

The proposed tube/honeycomb system is characterized by slightly shorter tubes inserted into the cells of the honeycomb with close fit. The individual tube and honeycomb structures are numerically modelled under low-speed vertical impact loading and compared with experiments conducted in this study. Next, three representative triangular sections, which involve the symmetric boundary conditions of each cell group, are employed to model the tube/honeycomb system. Load-displacement curves and deformation patterns are compared with the experiments. The proposed honeycomb/tube system is found to produce higher energy absorption capacities for both per unit mass and volume, compared to an ordinary superposition of the constituents. Almost a perfect crushing load plateau is achieved without a peak force. These enhancements are associated with the spontaneous pre-deformation of the tubes pushed by the collapsed honeycomb walls. This interaction also enables synchronised deformation throughout the crash. Finally, a parametric study is performed, based on the height difference between the tubes and honeycomb, which is found to be the determiner of the performance for the proposed system. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crushing honeycomb; crushing tubes; Energy absorbing system; explicit finite element analysis; prototype; synchronised deformation","Crashworthiness; Crushing; Deformation; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Thin walled structures; Tubes (components); Deformation pattern; Energy absorbing systems; Energy absorption capacity; Explicit finite element analysis; Interaction mechanisms; Load-displacement curve; prototype; Thin walled tubes; Honeycomb structures","undefined, (2009); Alexander, J.

Before these applications of numerical modeling techniques the simulations are to be accepted by the industry for design development and certification of composite aircraft structures, composites damage models have to be developed and implemented in commercial FE codes, and validation studies at specimen and substructure level have to be performed. Since the experimental tests are expensive and difficult to perform, numerical simulations can only provide significant help in designing high-efficiency bird-proof structures. The design concept is based on the absorption of the major portion of the bird kinetic energy by the composite skins, in order to protect the inner honeycomb core from damage, thus preserving the end plate functionality for safe landing. To this purpose, the end plate skin is fabricated from composite layers, which unfold under the impact load and increase the energy absorption capability. The numerical modeling of bird strike using the Lagrangian approach and smooth particle hydrodynamics formulation and the critical design parameters are considered in carrying out the analysis. A numerical model of this problem has been developed with an explicit finite element code Autodyn. Analysis is carried out for the developed model using the test parameters. Numerical results by means of bird modeling approaches and accurate simulations of composite structures phenomena during impact are substantiated with experimental test results. The results obtained from the analysis and test shows close conformity implying their appropriateness in the simulation of bird strike. © 2016, ASM International.","Bird strike; EOS; Failure analysis; SPH Bird model","Aircraft manufacture; Airframes; Birds; Failure analysis; Fighter aircraft; Honeycomb structures; Hydrodynamics; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Lagrange multipliers; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Rotors; Structural design; Structure (composition); Bird strike; Composite aircraft structure; Correlation studies; Critical design parameters; Energy absorption capability; Explicit finite element codes; La-grangian approaches; Smooth particle hydrodynamics; Finite element method","undefined; Design and Airworthiness Requirements for Service Aircraft; Technical Report Afml TR 77 134, (1977); Wilbeck, James S., The development of a substitute bird model, Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 103, 4, pp. 725-730, (1981); Sci Tech Rev, (2012); International Review of Mechanical Engineering, (2007); Technical Report Affdl TR 75 5, (1975); 28 Sept2, (2003); Proceedings of the 19th International Congress of Mechanical Engineering, (2007); Models and Methods for Bird Strike Load Predictions, (2007)",""

Performance of sandwich panels was quantified by maximum transverse deflection of the bottom face sheet and core crushing strain along with an investigation of their optimal behavior. Three failure modes were observed in panels - core failure, top face failure, and tearing and detachment from support. Failure maps of honeycomb sandwich panels were constructed to show the failure mode of panels as a function of shock intensity, projectile velocity and panel core relative density. In addition, a limited set of simulations were carried out to study the role of incident angle of projectile on the overall performance of a panel. These simulations showed that maximum deflection occurred for vertically impacting projectiles. However, we found that this did not directly translate to maximum core crushing strain in sandwich panels. The results provide new insight into the performance and failure of sandwich panels under complex dynamic loading conditions, and further highlight the potential of these panels for development of threat-resistant structural systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, a finite element (FE) model of the energy-absorbing structure was established and validated by corresponding experiments. Based on the validated FE model, the effects of the strength of honeycomb on the impact performance of the energy-absorbing structure were evaluated. The results showed that the initial peak force and the average impact force increase with the increasing strength of honeycomb, and the energy absorption also follows the same trend in a certain range of combined strength. Then, to optimise the crashworthiness of the energy-absorbing structure, the multi-objective optimisation, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the polynomial response surface method were adopted, The optima were given in the form of Pareto fronts and the most satisfactory solution was determined by the minimum distance between ‘utopia point’ and knee point. The results showed that whether the best optima can be obtained has nothing to do with the accuracy of the surrogate models.

The characteristics of the peculiar crushing patterns and modes in the re-entrant honeycomb are described. The energy absorption performances of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and the hexagonal honeycomb are compared. When subjected to the same magnitude of crushing strain, the re-entrant honeycomb can dissipate more energy through plastic deformation. But if the peak stress is the primary concern for the packaging material, the re-entrant structure tends to generate higher stress in order to dissipate the same amount of impact energy. Moreover, the structural irregularity of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb is defined and its influence on the dynamic crushing is studied. Unlike the hexagonal honeycomb, the irregular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb can absorb more energy than the regular one in the quasi-static regime. This situation reverses under high speed impact.

This paper compares the dynamic response of sandwich panels with different core materials when subjected to medium velocity impacts. The sandwich panels were made of aluminium facesheets with five different cores, viz., low density balsa wood, high density balsa wood, cork, polypropylene honeycomb, and polystyrene foam. All the specimens were impacted by an instrumented projectile with a hemispherical steel head at three impact energies of 43, 85 and 120 J. An accelerometer attached to the projectile and a high speed camera were used to collect data and record the impact process. 3D scanning technique was used to measure the deformation of front and back faces after impact. The impact properties of the sandwich panels with the five different cores were compared in terms of contact force, energy absorption, depth of indentation, overall bending deflection, etc. Post-mortem sectioning was conducted to examine the impact induced failures such as facesheet rupture, crush of core material, and debonding between facesheet and core. Finite element modelling was also carried out to elucidate the observed experimental results and further understand the effect of core material. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Core material; Energy absorption; Failure mechanism; Impact; Sandwich panel","Bending (forming); Coremaking; Energy absorption; Finite element method; High speed cameras; Polypropylenes; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Bending deflection; Core material; Depth of indentations; Failure mechanism; Finite element modelling; Impact; Polypropylene honeycombs; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Mackerle, Jaroslav, Finite element analyses of sandwich structures: A bibliography (1980-2001), Engineering Computations, 19, 1-2, pp. 206-245, (2002); Ramakrishnan, Karthik Ram, Effect of block copolymer nano-reinforcements on the low velocity impact response of sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 110, 1, pp. 174-182, (2014); Chai, Gin Boay, A review of low-velocity impact on sandwich structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 225, 4, pp. 207-230, (2011); Kolopp, Amélie, Experimental study of sandwich structures as armour against medium-velocity impacts, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 61, pp. 24-35, (2013); SAMPE J, (1994); Park, J.

The in-plane uniaxial collapse response of a second order hierarchical honeycomb (i.e., a regular hexagonal honeycomb with its cell walls consisting of an equilateral triangular honeycomb) is investigated. Its failure modes for quasi-static crushing and dynamic impact in two directions are systematically explored by finite element simulations. A two-scale method is proposed and analytical expressions for the quasi-static collapse stresses of the hierarchical honeycomb in the two directions are obtained. In conjunction with the conservation of momentum, the analytical quasi-static collapse stress models are extended to dynamic crushing. The obtained theoretical collapse stresses are validated by finite element simulations for a wide range of impact velocity and relative density. Both numerical and analytical results show that the hierarchical honeycomb has an improved collapse stress over traditional hexagonal and triangular honeycombs. The improvement is found to be more pronounced for low velocity impact than for high velocity impact. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The design is aimed at tuning and improving the band structure of periodic cellular structures. The proposed cellular configurations show a significantly wide band gap at much lower frequencies compared to their pure counterparts, while still retaining their major dynamic features. Different topologies involving both auxetic inclusions in a conventional lattice and conversely hexagonal cellular inclusions in auxetic butterfly lattices are presented. For all these cases the impact of the varying degree of auxeticity on the band structure is evaluated. The proposed cellular designs may offer significant advantages in tuning high-frequency bandgap behaviour, which is relevant to phononics applications. The configurations shown in this paper may be made iso-volumetric and iso-weight to a given regular hexagonal topology, making possible to adapt the hybrid lattices to existing sandwich structures with fixed dimensions and weights.

In order to investigate the benefits provided by the CEM system, a full-scale railway passenger car collision with a rigid wall is simulated by using dynamic/explicit finite element (FE) methods. The crushing force, secondary impact velocity, acceleration and velocity curves, and deformation modes are computed to allow a comparison of the crashworthiness performance of a passenger car equipped with the proposed CEM system with that of a conventional passenger car.

Honeycomb sandwich panels with different facesheet thicknesses are impacted by drop-weight machine under gradually increasing impact energies. The visible surface damage is recorded and ultrasonic C-scan technology is used to inspect the internal damage of sandwich plates. Numerical simulation is conducted using finite element method, taking into account both facesheet damage and honeycomb damage. The facesheet damage model is based on the continuum damage mechanics and cohesive zone model to simulate intralaminar and interlaminar damage respectively. The honeycomb damage model, which takes into account of both compressive damage and shear damage, is addressed and verified by three-point bending experimental tests. The numerical results show good agreements on LVI and CAI with the experiments, thus verifying the validity of the presented numerical model. Then we use the numerical model to simulate the LVI properties of sandwich plates under compressive and tensile preloading. We conclude that the interlaminar delamination damage of facesheet easily evolves under compressive preloading while intralaminar fiber fracture damage could expand under tensile preloading.

The adhesive layer between the skin and core is modelled using linear springs, with reduced rigidity for the debonded sectors.

A finite element modeling framework is proposed for the sandwich composite comprising continuum damage, cohesive layers and crushable foam model with isotropic hardening for the core. The model shows how progressive damage in the facesheets, interlaminar damage between the layers and the crushable foam can be used to model low velocity impact and temperature effects. Ultrasonic testing and high speed cameras are used to determine the damage and delamination characteristics. The higher exposure temperatures result in larger damage zones for both the low and high impact energies. The elevated temperature enhanced the penetration rate and indentation depth showing degradations in the out of plane properties. The visible damage test results in significant damage in the core and facesheets dependent on the temperature ranges tested.

Two SCS sandwich panels with different core depths were tested and the impulsive loading was applied in the laboratory by utilizing an inflated high pressure airbag to transfer the impact load from dropped projectile onto the panels. The deformation modes, applied pressures, displacement and strain responses of the panels were determined in the test. A combination of bending and shear deformation mode was observed in the SCS panel with thinner core while there was minimal visible deformation in the thicker panel. The maximum and permanent deformations of the panel with thicker panel were significantly reduced due to the increase in resistance and mass. Debonding between grout core and bottom plate was also noted in both panels during impact from the strain-time histories. Following the test, Finite Element (FE) models were constructed and verified against the test data to simulate the tests.

Rather than restating details of the existing traditional regular hexagonal honeycomb, this paper introduces reinforced hexagonal honeycomb. The full-scale elaborator finite-element model created through LS-DYNA is validated by available theoretical solutions and experimental results. Afterwards, the validated simulation model is further applied to do a number of parametric studies on the reinforced hexagonal honeycomb under dynamic impact. The parameters such as stiffener thickness, expanding angle, cell length, cell wall thickness, impact mass, impact velocity and end constraint are employed to determine their relative effects on crushing behaviour of the reinforced hexagonal honeycomb. In the multi-objective crashworthiness optimisation, optimal Latin hypercube design method is used to select the sampling design points from the design space. To obtain a maximum specific energy absorption per mass () capability and minimum initial peak stress (), response surface method, which is an accurate surrogate modelling method is adopted.

Two modelling approaches are investigated, providing different levels of accuracy; in both approaches, the sandwich structure is idealised as a layered stack with the skin modelled using shell elements; while the core is either modelled with fine detail using beam micro-elements representing the cell struts, or is modelled by three-dimensional solid elements after an appropriate core homogenisation. Design/methodology/approach: The applied homogenisation methodology, as well as the all important modelling issues are presented in detail. Experimental tests performed using a mass-drop testing machine are used for the successful validation of the simulation models. Findings: It was concluded that the core microscale models having detailed FE modelling of the core unit cells geometry with fine scale beam elements are suitable for the analysis of the core failure modes and the prediction of the basic core stiffness and strength properties. It was demonstrated that the homogenised core model provides significant advantages with respect to computing time and cost, although they require additional calculations in order to define the homogenised stress-strain curves. Research limitations/implications: Special microscale material tests are required for the determination of appropriate materials parameters of the core models, as steel selective laser melting (SLM) microstrut properties differ from the constitutive steel material ones, due to the core manufacturing SLM technique. Stress interactions were not taken into account in the homogenisation, as the applied core material model supports the introduction of independent stress-strain curves; however, the predicted load deflection results appeared to be very close to those obtained from the detailed core micromodels. Originality/value: The paper is original. The dynamic behaviour of conventional sandwich structures comprising conventional honeycomb type cores has been extensively studied, using simple mass-spring models, energy based models, as well as FE models. However, the response of sandwich panels with innovative SLM cellular cores has been limited. In the present paper, novel modelling approaches for the simulation of the structural response of sandwich panels having innovative open lattice cellular cores produced by SLM are investigated. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Homogenization; Impact; Sandwich panel","Coremaking; Homogenization method; Honeycomb structures; Industrial research; Melting; Sandwich structures; Selective laser melting; Stress-strain curves; Testing; Appropriate materials; Design/methodology/approach; Energy-based models; Impact; Sandwich panel; Selective laser melting (SLM); Stiffness and strength properties; Three dimensional solid element; Structural design","Cellular Solids, (1997); Handbook of Cellular Metals, (2002); Tsopanos, Sozon, The influence of processing parameters on the mechanical properties of selectively laser melted stainless steel microlattice structures, Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, 132, 4, pp. 0410111-04101112, (2010); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Dynamic models for low-velocity impact damage of composite sandwich panels -Part B: Damage initiation, Composite Structures, 52, 3-4, pp. 353-364, (2001); Shipsha, Andrey V., Failure Mechanisms and Modelling of Impact Damage in Sandwich Beams - A 2D Approach: Part II - Analysis and Modelling, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 5, 1, pp. 33-51, (2003); Akil, Hazizan Md., The low velocity impact response of an aluminium honeycomb sandwich structure, Composites Part B: Engineering, 34, 8, pp. 679-687, (2003); Besant, T., Finite element modelling of low velocity impact of composite sandwich panels, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 32, 9, pp. 1189-1196, (2001); Labeas, G.

The definition and characteristics of these barriers, usually made from aluminium honeycomb, have evolved over time with the aim of improving the stiffness and capacity of absorbing the forces of a frontal impact of a vehicle type, and its compatibility with other vehicles in a real crash situation. In Europe, barriers defined by UN-ECE 94 (frontal collision) and UN-ECE 95 (lateral collision) regulations are currently used, although later developments such as the Advanced European Mobile Deformable Barrier (AE-MDB) will better represent the stiffness of the European-type vehicle. In the USA, the MDB developed by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is used in tests prescribed by the FMVSS 214D and FMVSS 301 standards, as well as other barriers such as that developed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, whose dimensions, stiffness and mass are more similar to the features of the front structure of American suburban vehicles and pickups.These deformable barriers are useful for showing the deformation, deceleration levels, energy absorbed and for determining crashworthiness in different crash test configurations for which they were designed. However, they are not valid for other configurations, such as collisions involving heavy vehicles in which the total energy in play is very high, or when the crash affects different parts of the vehicle or at different angles of impact.This article describes the methodology followed to define the dimensions, stiffness and energy-absorbing capacity of the elements included in the design of new deformable barriers, which have to be capable of reproducing the vehicle behaviour depending on crash configurations and the size of the area of the vehicle affected by the collision. To do so, the available crash test data on certain types of vehicle were first collected. For each test, a series of characteristic parameters indicative of the severity of the collision were obtained. Then, a representative vehicle type was defined which corresponds to the average values of these parameters. Also, the design of the deformable barrier was addressed, and finite-elements models were made using solid elements with explicit formulation. The results of the barrier simulation were compared with the characteristic parameters of the representative vehicle type. In order to achieve an equivalence of the performance required, modifications to the design of the barrier were then made.This methodology is being applied to the design of new frontal barriers, which will be useful for assessing the crashworthiness of vehicles in types of collision which are different from those contemplated in current regulations. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","collision; crashworthiness; deformable barrier; FEM; vehicle","Automobile testing; Deformation; Finite element method; Highway accidents; Highway engineering; Stiffness; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Aluminium honeycomb; collision; Current regulations; deformable barrier; Energy-absorbing capacity; Explicit formulation; Finite elements models; National highway traffic safety administrations; Crashworthiness","6th European Ls Dyna User Conference, (2007); 7th European Ls Dyna User Conference, (2009); 10th International Ls Dyna User Conference, (2008); Asprone, Domenico, Statistical finite element analysis of the buckling behavior of honeycomb structures, Composite Structures, 105, pp. 240-255, (2013); Iihs Solid Barrier Documentation, (2011); Buitrago, Brenda L., Modelling of composite sandwich structures with honeycomb core subjected to high-velocity impact, Composite Structures, 92, 9, pp. 2090-2096, (2010); Official J Eur Commun L 018, (1997); Ece Regulation no 95 Uniform Provisions Concerning the Approval of Vehicles with Regard to the Protection of the Occupants in the Event of A Lateral Collision United Nations Economic Commission for Europe; Proceedings of the 23rd Technical Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles Esv, (2013); Hexweb Honeycomb Attributes and Properties, (1999)",""

Two different core material and architecture combinations are investigated; a UV-cured photopolymer lattice, produced from a network of self-propagating waveguides, and an aluminum alloy lattice cast from an initial polymer template. For each of these sandwich panel configurations, impact tests were performed with a drop-weight hemispherical impactor under four different energy levels. The applied impact force, impactor velocity and residual damage in the sandwich panel were all measured and used for comparison against finite element simulations of the impact tests. These simulations employed a homogenized continuum constitutive model, designed to replicate the deformation response of the lattice core without requiring explicit representation of the geometric features of the lattice. For both sandwich panel designs at all impact energy levels, excellent correlation was observed between the experimental measurements and impact simulations. Additionally, each sandwich design was shown to be effective at absorbing the kinetic energy of the impactor with minimal damage to the back (non-impacted) face of the panel. Implementation of these lattice core sandwich panels and extension of the homogenized constitutive model to other sandwich applications are also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cellular solids; Finite element method; Homogenization; Lattice materials; Sandwich panel; User material","Constitutive models; Coremaking; Homogenization method; Honeycomb structures; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Mobile security; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Structural panels; Cellular solids; Deformation response; Explicit representation; Finite element simulations; Impact energy levels; Lattice materials; Sandwich panel; User material; Finite element method","Sandwich Construction the Bending and Buckling of Sandwich Beams Plates and Shells, (1966); Evans, Anthony G., Lightweight materials and structures, MRS Bulletin, 26, 10, pp. 790-797, (2001); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Jacobsen, Alan J., Micro-scale truss structures formed from self-propagating photopolymer waveguides, Advanced Materials, 19, 22, pp. 3892-3896, (2007); Jacobsen, Alan J., Shear behavior of polymer micro-scale truss structures formed from self-propagating polymer waveguides, Acta Materialia, 56, 6, pp. 1209-1218, (2008); Deshpande, Vikram S., Effective properties of the octet-truss lattice material, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 49, 8, pp. 1747-1769, (2001); Kooistra, Gregory W., Compressive behavior of age hardenable tetrahedral lattice truss structures made from aluminium, Acta Materialia, 52, 14, pp. 4229-4237, (2004); Mines, Robert A.W., On the characterisation of foam and micro-lattice materials used in sandwich construction, Strain, 44, 1, pp. 71-83, (2008); Shen, Y., The mechanical properties of sandwich structures based on metal lattice architectures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 12, 2, pp. 159-180, (2010); Sypeck, David J., Cellular metal truss core sandwich structures, Advanced Engineering Materials, 4, 10, pp. 759-764, (2002)",""

The quasi-static and impact behaviors of both uniform and functionally graded DAHs are explored. Analytical expressions for the in-plane Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and quasi-static yield stress of uniform DAHs are derived and are found to be consistent with finite element (FE) predictions, showing that the quasi-static yield stress of DAHs is dependent upon the geometrical parameters and NPR. Systematical simulations of uniform DAHs subject to different impact velocities reveal that there exists a critical impact velocity beyond which the dynamic plateau stress is insensitive to the effect of NPR. A semi-empirical expression of the plateau stress is obtained. For functionally graded DAHs, they are shown to only have improved energy absorption capacity under high velocity impacts. Moreover, the results of uniform DAHs are shown to be able to be adopted to interpret the simulated plateau stress of functionally graded DAHs under impact loading.

Design/methodology/approach - A negative stiffness honeycomb is fabricated in nylon 11 using selective laser sintering. Its force-displacement behavior is simulated with finite element analysis and experimentally evaluated under quasi-static displacement loading. Similarly, a hexagonal honeycomb of equivalent relative density is also fabricated and tested. The energy absorbed for both specimens is computed from the resulting force-displacement curves. The beam geometry of the negative stiffness honeycomb is optimized for maximum energy absorption per unit mass of material. Findings - Negative stiffness honeycombs exhibit relatively large positive stiffness, followed by a region of plateau stress as the cell walls buckle, similar to regular hexagonal honeycombs, but unlike regular honeycombs, they demonstrate full recovery after compression. Representative specimens are found to absorb about 65 per cent of the energy incident on them. Optimizing the negative stiffness beam geometry can result in energy-absorbing capacities comparable to regular honeycombs of similar relative densities. Research limitations/implications - The honeycombs were subject to quasi-static displacement loading. To study shock isolation under impact loads, force-controlled loading is desirable. However, the energy absorption performance of the negative stiffness honeycombs is expected to improve under force-controlled conditions. Additional experimentation is needed to investigate the rate sensitivity of the force-displacement behavior of the negative stiffness honeycombs, and specimens with various geometries should be investigated. Originality/value - The findings of this study indicate that recoverable energy absorption is possible using negative stiffness honeycombs without sacrificing the high energy-absorbing capacity of regular honeycombs. The honeycombs can find usefulness in a number of unique applications requiring recoverable shock isolation, such as bumpers, helmets and other personal protection devices. A patent application has been filed for the negative stiffness honeycomb design. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Design; Honeycomb materials; Mechanical properties of materials; Negative stiffness; Selective laser sintering","Design; Energy absorption; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Laser heating; Materials properties; Molecular biology; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Design/methodology/approach; Energy absorption capacity; Energy-absorbing capacity; Force-displacement behavior; Honeycomb materials; Mechanical properties of materials; Negative stiffness; Quasi-static displacement; Stiffness","Fulcher, Ben A., Analytical and experimental investigation of buckled beams as negative stiffness elements for passive vibration and shock isolation systems, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 136, 3, (2014); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Hayes, Alethea M., Mechanics of linear cellular alloys, Mechanics of Materials, 36, 8, pp. 691-713, (2004); Kashdan, Lia, Design, fabrication, and evaluation of negative stiffness elements using SLS, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 18, 3, pp. 194-200, (2012); Klatt, Timothy D., Selective laser sintering of negative stiffness mesostructures for recoverable, nearly-ideal shock isolation, pp. 1010-1022, (2013); Qiu, Jin, A curved-beam bistable mechanism, Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, 13, 2, pp. 137-146, (2004)",""

The main motivation for the study is the accidental impact of a human body on the interior sandwich structure of a civil aircraft during a crash situation. The considered model is a rectangular simply supported sandwich plate that is loaded dynamically by the centric impact of a spherical body with varying stiffness. In principle, the impactor stiffness has a significant influence on the contact forces between impactor and sandwich structure, and consequently, leads to a change in the impactor deceleration and re-acceleration as well as a change in the contact duration. However, the deformation of a ""softer"" impactor causes a smoother load introduction. Thus, two questions arise: can the altered stress distribution change the initial failure mode of the sandwich structure? And how are the deformations and deceleration and accelerations of the elastic impactor influenced? As, particularly, the latter question is crucial to human safety in crash situations, the inertia loads exerted on the elastic impactor are evaluated in detail by standard injury criteria. © IMechE 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","elastic body; human impact; human safety; Impact; impact on sandwich panel; intermediate mass impact; intermediate velocity impact; low velocity impact; quasi-static impact; quasi-static response; sandwich failure; soft impact","Aircraft accidents; Deformation; Elasticity; Honeycomb structures; Stiffness; Elastic body; Human impact; Human safety; Impact; Intermediate velocities; Low velocity impact; Mass impact; Quasi static response; Quasi-static; Sandwich panel; Soft impact; Sandwich structures","Impact Engineering of Composite Structures, (2011); Olsson, Robin, Mass criterion for wave controlled impact response of composite plates, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 31, 8, pp. 879-887, (2000); Divider Panel Modelling and Validation Excerpt, (2004); Mines, Robert A.W., The static and impact behaviour of polymer composite sandwich beams, Composites, 25, 2, pp. 95-110, (1994); Structural and Failure Mechanics of Sandwich Composites, (2011); Arbeitskreis Messdatenverarbeitung Fahrzeugsicherheit Mdvfs Arbeitsgruppe Algorithmen, (2008); Certification Specification Cs 25 562 Amendment 12, (2012); European Union Directive 102 EC, (2003); Fmvss 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact; Proceeding of the 15th Stapp Car Crash Conference, (1971)",""

This behavior is observed during the first contact, when the platform impacts the decelerator. This non-programed deceleration usually influences the development of the test, as it modifies the deceleration pulse, reaching levels high enough to activate the airbag pyrotechnics. To overcome the rod’s inertia it is common practice to use a hydraulic bump shock absorber. This absorber employs hydraulic fluid or air to dissipate the kinetic energy. This study, proposes using an alternative mechanical bump shock absorber, in which the kinetic energy is transformed to deformation energy through the plastic deformation of an aluminum honeycomb panel. While for the hydraulic bump shock absorber it is necessary to perform tests to adjust the absorbed energy, in the proposed mechanical bump shock absorber the absorbed energy is estimated through a nonlinear finite element simulation using Abaqus Explicit V6.8–2. Therefore, this non-conventional mechanical bump shock absorber can be used to minimize the effect of the rod’s inertia on the deceleration pulse. © 2015, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bump shock absorber; Deformation energy; Hydraulic decelerator; Nonlinear simulation; Sled test","ABAQUS; Air; Deceleration; Finite element method; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Safety testing; ABAQUS EXPLICIT; Absorbed energy; Aluminum honeycomb; Deformation energy; Finite element simulations; Nonlinear finite element simulation; Nonlinear simulations; Sled test; Shock absorbers","Vehicle Crashworthiness and Occupant Protection, (2025); Simplified Models of Vehicle Impact for Injury Mitigation, (2005); Choi, Wonmok Mog, Effect of punch angle on energy absorbing characteristics of tube-type crash elements, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 12, 3, pp. 383-389, (2011); Workgroup Data Processing Vehicle Safety 2005, (2005); undefined; undefined; Han, Moon Sihk, Experimental study on the impact characteristics of a sandwich composite with an aluminum foam core, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 14, 1, pp. 61-66, (2013); Crash Mechanics, (2002); Jiuhong, Jia, Design method for fluid viscous dampers, Archive of Applied Mechanics, 78, 9, pp. 737-746, (2008); Lee, Choon-tae, Simulation and experimental validation of vehicle dynamic characteristics for displacement-sensitive shock absorber using fluid-flow modelling, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 20, 2, pp. 373-388, (2006)",""

Back-supported sandwich panels were impacted on the front face by a flat-bottomed or a circular punch at constant velocity ranging from quasi-static loading to 100 m/s. At velocities below 10 m/s the forces on the front and back faces are equal but inertia stabilisation raises the peak load above its quasi-static value. This strength elevation is greater for the corrugated core than for the Y-frame core, and more pronounced for the flat-bottomed punch than for the circular punch. For velocities greater than 10 m/s, the indentation force applied to the front face exceeds the force transmitted to the back face due to plastic-shock effects. In this regime, the force transmitted to the back face by the Y-frame core is markedly less than for the corrugated core, and this brings a performance benefit to the Y-frame, i.e. it protects the underlying structure in the event of a collision. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Corrugated core; Indentation; Sandwich panel; Y-frame core","Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Indentation; Sandwich structures; Stainless steel; Velocity; Constant velocities; Corrugated core; Dynamic indentation; Impact velocities; Performance benefits; Quasi-static loading; Sandwich panel; Steel sandwich panels; Loading","Kujala, Pentti, Analysis of the marine traffic safety in the Gulf of Finland, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 94, 8, pp. 1349-1357, (2009); Naar, Hendrik, Comparison of the crashworthiness of various bottom and side structures, Marine Structures, 15, 4-5, pp. 443-460, (2002); Full Scale Ship Collision Experiments 1998, (1999); Rubino, Vito, The three-point bending of Y-frame and corrugated core sandwich beams, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 52, 3, pp. 485-494, (2010); St-Pierre, Luc, Sandwich Beams with Corrugated and Y-frame cores: Does the back face contribute to the bending response?, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 79, 1, (2012); Tilbrook, M.

First, the honeycomb models filled with different reentrant cells by the variation of micro-cell configuration parameters (cell-wall angle and shape ratio) are established. The respective influences of micro-structure and impact velocities on the deformation behaviors, the dynamic plateau stresses and the absorbed energy of reentrant honeycombs are explored in detail. It is shown that owing to the variation of cell micro-structure, reentrant honeycombs display different macro-/micro- deformation properties during the crushing. For the given impact velocity, the dynamic plateau stresses are related to the shape ratio by a power law and to the cell-wall angle by least-square curves. And they are also proportional to the square of impact velocities for a high impact velocity. Based on the finite element simulated results and one-dimensional shock wave theory, an empirical formula for auxetic honeycomb to predict the dynamic plateau stress is derived in terms of relative density and impact velocity. © The Author(s) 2014.","In-plane dynamic crushing; Micro-structure; Negative Poisson’s ratio; Plateau stress; Reentrant honeycombs","Cells; Cytology; Deformation; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Shock waves; Velocity; Dynamic plateau stress; Explicit dynamic finite element; High-impact velocities; In-plane dynamic crushing; One-dimensional shock wave theories; Plateau stress; Reentrant honeycombs; S ratio; Crushing","Carneiro, Vítor Hugo Pimenta, Auxetic materials - A review, Materials Science-Poland, 31, 4, pp. 561-571, (2013); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Evans, Ken E., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, 6340, (1991); Smardzewski, Jerzy, Design of small auxetic springs for furniture, Materials and Design, 51, pp. 723-728, (2013); Prawoto, Yunan, Seeing auxetic materials from the mechanics point of view: A structural review on the negative Poisson's ratio, Computational Materials Science, 58, pp. 140-153, (2012); Lakes, Roderic S., Foam structures with a negative poisson's ratio, Science, 235, 4792, pp. 1038-1040, (1987); Choi, J.

Large composite tanks possessing cylindrical shape are produced using the winding process. Therefore, the inal products have uneven thickness and ibre orientation lamina layers, and also an unevenly impregnated honeycomb layer. The aim of this research is to develop an economically attractive embedded ultrasonic measurement technique for on-field diagnostics of complex composite structures used for production of large liquid storage tanks. Development of the relatively cheap and easy to operate embedded diagnostic/monitoring technique is important aiming to assure safety of liquid storage tanks (monitoring structural integrity against overpressure, etc.) and detection of accidental defects that may appear during transportation, installation and exploitation of those structures. Typical defects that are aimed to be detected are relatively large delaminations/disbonds (area having diameter of 150-200 mm) of skin layers caused by low energy impacts that cannot be detected visually and show severe influence on the structural strength and safety of liquid tanks. This work presents results of numerical modeling and experimental research in low frequency (50 kHz) ultrasonic guided waves (UGW) propagation in large honeycomb composite structures. Finite element (FE) simulation of UGW propagation has been made aiming to reduce quantity of ultrasonic transducers and optimize their placement on composite structure. The possibilities to place ultrasonic transducers and receivers on both sides (internal or external) of compositestructures and to use such a proposed technique for detection of delamination/debonding areas caused by low energy impacts or alternating semi static loads (e.g. filling and draining of liquid from storage tank) and monitoring of partial self-healing of relatively rigid composite structures were proved by experimental testing. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Condition monitoring; Delamination and debonding; Embedded transducers; Honeycomb core; Multi-layered composite; Ultrasonic guided waves","Condition monitoring; Defects; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Honeycomb structures; Liquids; Rigid structures; Structure (composition); Tanks (containers); Transducers; Ultrasonic transducers; Ultrasonic waves; Complex composite structures; Embedded transducers; Finite element simulations; Honeycomb core; Large liquid storage tanks; Multi-layered composites; Structure of composites; Ultrasonic guided wave; Ultrasonic applications","Zeleniakiene, Daiva, Numerical investigation of impact behaviour of sandwich fiber reinforced plastic composites, Mechanika, 85, 5, pp. 31-36, (2010); Ibarra-Castanedo, Clemente, Comparative study of active thermography techniques for the nondestructive evaluation of honeycomb structures, Research in Nondestructive Evaluation, 20, 1, pp. 1-31, (2009); Hay, Thomas R., Rapid inspection of composite skin-honeycomb core structures with ultrasonic guided waves, Journal of Composite Materials, 37, 10, pp. 929-939, (2003); Sharma, Nitin, Fatigue of foam and honeycomb core composite sandwich structures: A tutorial, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 8, 4, pp. 263-319, (2006); Freeman, Brian, The effect of low-velocity impact on the fatigue life of Sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 70, 3, pp. 374-381, (2005); Schulz, Mark J., Health monitoring and active control of composite structures using piezoceramic patches, Composites Part B: Engineering, 30, 7, pp. 713-725, (1999); Loutas, Theodoros H., Intelligent health monitoring of aerospace composite structures based on dynamic strain measurements, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 9, pp. 8412-8422, (2012); Hsu, David Kuei, Nondestructive testing using air-borne ultrasound, Ultrasonics, 44, SUPPL., pp. e1019-e1024, (2006); Kažys, R.

Finite element modelling of as-tested struts was carried out using X-ray microtomography scans of the undeformed struts to define the geometry. Strut deformation was described by continuum viscoplastic damage constitutive equations calibrated by microtensile test data of the aluminium alloy in its optimally aged condition. The as-tested strut finite element model was used to develop a procedure that compensates for the effect of grip slippage inherent in the microtensile testing of metal foam struts, which results in a considerable reduction in observed elastic stiffness compared to the typical value of 70 GPa for aluminium alloys. The calibrated constitutive equations were then implemented in finite element models of sandwich panels with the aluminium metal foam as its core material. The finite element models were used in simulations of cases of low energy impact to represent tool drop conditions in order to investigate the suitability of new wing skin designs using metal foam core sandwich panels. An optimal strut aspect ratio was identified through simulation that provides the greatest energy absorption per unit mass while ensuring core damage is accurately reflected by facesheet deformation, which is necessary for detection and repair. © IMechE 2014.","Damage modelling; Metal foams; Microtensile testing; Microtomography; Sandwich panels","Aspect ratio; Constitutive equations; Coremaking; Damage detection; Deformation; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Metals; Sandwich structures; Struts; Tomography; X rays; Damage modelling; Finite element modelling; Foam core sandwich panels; Micro-tomography; Microtensile testing; Open-cell metal foams; Sandwich panel; X ray microtomography; Metal foams","Metal Foams A Design Guide, (2000); Banhart, John, Manufacture, characterisation and application of cellular metals and metal foams, Progress in Materials Science, 46, 6, pp. 559-632, (2001); Evans, Anthony G., The topological design of multifunctional cellular metals, Progress in Materials Science, 46, 3-4, pp. 309-327, (2001); Bart-Smith, Hilary, Influence of imperfections on the performance of metal foam core sandwich panels, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, 19, pp. 4999-5012, (2002); Evans, Anthony G., Multifunctionality of cellular metal systems, Progress in Materials Science, 43, 3, pp. 171-221, (1998); Singh, Randhir, Titanium foams for biomedical applications: A review, Materials Technology, 25, 3-4, pp. 127-136, (2010); McCormack, T.

In a specific impact energy range, energy absorption efficiency in carbon fiber composite sandwich panels is higher than that of 304 stainless-steel sandwich panels and aluminum alloy sandwich panels owing to the big density of metal materials.

The 9-m free drop test requirement onto an unyielding surface is performed in an orientation 'for which maximum damage is expected'. Analytical techniques are used to evaluate various possible impact orientations before testing, and historically these maximal damage orientations have been side, slap-down, end, and centre-ofgravity over corner. Other orientations are rarely considered. Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) was asked by Equipos NuclearesSA (ENSA) todesign, analyse, and test animpact limiter system for a newly designed rail cask. During the conceptual design process, SNL performed due diligence and evaluated a wide spectrum of possible impact orientations, in order to assure that peak cask body acceleration design goals were not exceeded. However, design of the impact limiter, including not only crush strength of constituent materials (which can be orientation and temperature dependent), but also the shape of the impact limiter, greatly affects peak acceleration response during 9-m drops in various orientations. Although many impact limiter design shapes resemble truncated right circular cylinders attached to each end of the cask, some tend to round the outer corners or truncate those corners with conical sections. SNL's original conceptual design followed a similar theme, intending to use polyurethane foam or aluminium honeycomb within a bevelled corner shaped cylindrical shell. Detailed finite element analyses indicated excellent impact resistance at regulatory cold temperatures in the stereotypically tested side, slap-down, end, and CGOC impact orientations. Shortly before proceeding to engineering design, a rarely-considered impact orientation of 45° from horizontal indicated that cask body acceleration levels jumped unexpectedly, exceeding the design goal due to insufficient crushable material protecting the sharp corner of the cask. A complete re-design of the impact limiter was necessary, and the lessons learned from this experience could have implications for future impact limiter designs, and possibly existing designs that may not have considered this atypical impact orientation during the design process. © 2014 Sandia National Laboratories.","Corner impact; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Impact limiters; Impact resistance; Package design; Radioactive materials transport","Conceptual design; Drops; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Impact resistance; Materials handling; Radioactive materials; Radioactive waste transportation; Corner impact; Impact limiters; Implications for futures; International atomic energy agency; Nuclear regulatory commission; Package designs; Sandia National Laboratories; Temperature dependent; Circular cylinders","Safety Analysis Report for Packaging 910469 N C, (1994); Jai Corporation, (2005); Safety Analysis Report, (2005); Code of Federal Regulations; Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material, (1996)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Explicit dynamic finite element method simulations are carried out by using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Firstly, under the assumption that the cell wall length is the same, a density-graded honeycomb mode is established by the variation of the cell wall thicknesses along the crushing direction. The effects of density gradient and impact velocity on the crushing deformation modes, plateau stresses and energy absorption characteristics of the specimens are explored in detail. Numerical results show that except for the impact velocity, the dynamic crushing performance and energy absorption abilities of honeycombs also rely on the density/strength gradients. The weakest layer is suggested to be placed at the impact end or the output end, and the strongest layer at the intermediate stage to achieve higher energy absorbing efficiency. According to the one-dimensional shock wave theory, the simple empirical formulae for graded honeycombs to predict the plateau stress are given under high-impact velocities. These results will provide some useful guides in the multi-objective optimization dynamic design and shock energy absorbing control of sandwich structures. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","energy absorption; gradient design; Honeycombs; impact behavior; in-plane","Absorption characteristics; Energy absorbing efficiencies; Explicit dynamic finite element method; Honeycombs; Impact behavior; in-plane; In-plane dynamic crushing; One-dimensional shock wave theories; Crushing; Honeycomb structures; Multiobjective optimization; Energy absorption","Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Forsvarmedicin, (1971); Cooper, Graham J., The role of stress waves in thoracic visceral injury from blast loading: Modification of stress transmission by foams and high-density materials, Journal of Biomechanics, 24, 5, pp. 273-285, (1991); Cripps, Neil P.J., The influence of personal blast protection on the distribution and severity of primary blast gut injury, Journal of Trauma, 40, 3 SUPPL., pp. S206-S211, (1996); Li, Qingming, Attenuation or enhancement - A one-dimensional analysis on shock transmission in the solid phase of a cellular material, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 27, 10, pp. 1049-1065, (2002); Li, Qingming, About one-dimensional shock propagation in a cellular material, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 11, pp. 1898-1906, (2006); Elnasri, Ibrahim, Shock enhancement of cellular structures under impact loading: Part I Experiments, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2652-2671, (2007); Pattofatto, Stéphane, Shock enhancement of cellular structures under impact loading: Part II analysis, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 55, 12, pp. 2672-2686, (2007); Zhu, Feng, Shock enhancement effect of lightweight composite structures and materials, Composites Part B: Engineering, 42, 5, pp. 1202-1211, (2011)",""

Aims of this paper are the numerical investigation of aluminium honeycomb sandwiches subjected to low-velocity impact tests and the validation of finite element (FE) results. Before and after the low-velocity impact tests at different velocities, three dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the honeycomb panels have been carried out by a computed tomographic system in order to acquire exactly the dimension and the shape of the damage and to obtain information about geometry and cells defects.

While the aluminum face sheet is isotropic, the honeycomb core assumes orthotropic characteristics due to its configuration and strenuous load transfer paths. It is now well established that stiffness, dynamic, and low velocity impact response of the honeycomb core sandwich panel are critically dependent on the elastic constants of the core. An attempt is made to determine the elastic constants of orthotropic core through finite element approach simulating the load transfer and fixity boundary conditions likely to be prevalent in the unit cell of the honeycomb core. The cell wall thickness and the cell shape dictated by plastic bending limitations have also been simulated to determine their influence on the elastic constants. Further, the cell wall thickness and the bend radius have been varied and their influence on orthotropic elastic constants has been determined. The results of the study have been compared with analytical solutions proposed by researchers.

Nevertheless, due to manufacturing defects or impact loads, these structures can be subject to imperfect bonding or debonding between the skin and the honeycomb core. The presence of debonding reduces the bending stiffness of the composite panel, which causes detectable changes in its vibration characteristics. This article presents a new supervised learning algorithm to identify debonded regions in aluminum honeycomb panels. The algorithm uses a linear approximation method handled by a statistical inference model based on the maximum-entropy principle. The merits of this new approach are twofold: training is avoided and data is processed in a period of time that is comparable to the one of neural networks. The honeycomb panels are modeled with finite elements using a simplified three-layer shell model. The adhesive layer between the skin and core is modeled using linear springs, the rigidities of which are reduced in debonded sectors. The algorithm is validated using experimental data of an aluminum honeycomb panel under different damage scenarios. ©2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Damage assessment; Debonding; Honeycomb; Linear approximation; Maximum-entropy principle; Sandwich structures","","Sandwich Structures 7 Advancing with Sandwich Structures and Materials, (2005); Carden, Eoin Peter, Vibration based condition monitoring: A review, Structural Health Monitoring, 3, 4, pp. 355-377, (2004); Zou, Y., Vibration-based model-dependent damage (delamination) identification and health monitoring for composite structures - a review, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 230, 2, pp. 357-378, (2000); Montalvão, Diogo, A review of vibration-based structural health monitoring with special emphasis on composite materials, Shock and Vibration Digest, 38, 4, pp. 295-324, (2006); Jiang, Long, Vibratory behaviour of delaminated honeycomb structures: A 3-D finite element modelling, Computers and Structures, 55, 5, pp. 773-788, (1995); Kim, Hyeung-yun, Effect of debonding on natural frequencies and frequency response functions of honeycomb sandwich beams, Composite Structures, 55, 1, pp. 51-62, (2002); Burlayenko, Vyacheslav N., Dynamic behaviour of sandwich plates containing single/multiple debonding, Computational Materials Science, 50, 4, pp. 1263-1268, (2011); Burlayenko, Vyacheslav N., Influence of skin/core debonding on free vibration behavior of foam and honeycomb cored sandwich plates, International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics, 45, 10, pp. 959-968, (2010); International Journal of Scientific Engineering Research, (2013); Shahdin, Amir, Damage monitoring in sandwich beams by modal parameter shifts: A comparative study of burst random and sine dwell vibration testing, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 329, 5, pp. 566-584, (2010)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

A total of nine experiments, corresponding to three different blast intensity levels were conducted in the 28-inch square shock tube apparatus. Computational models were developed to capture the experimental details and further study the mechanism of blast wave-sandwich panel interactions. The peak reflected overpressure was monitored, which amplified to approximately 2.5 times of the incident overpressure due to fluid-structure interactions. The measured strain histories demonstrated opposite phases at the center of the front and back facesheets. Both strains showed damped oscillation with a reduced oscillation frequency as well as amplified facesheet deformations at the higher blast intensity. As the blast wave traversed across the panel, the observed flow separation and reattachment led to pressure increase at the back side of the panel. Further parametric studies suggested that the maximum deflection of the back facesheet increased dramatically with higher blast intensity and decreased with larger facesheet and core thickness. Our computational models, calibrated by experimental measurements, could be used as a virtual tool for assessing the mechanism of blast-panel interactions, and predicting the structural response of composite panels subjected to blast loading. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Its perforation resistant performance under high-velocity projectile impact was numerically analyzed using the validated finite element simulation techniques and compared with that of the aluminum foam-cored sandwich panel (AFP) of identical dimensions and weight.

A parametric study was carried out to investigate the effects of several key parameters, including impact velocity, face and core thicknesses, and core density, on the ballistic resistance of the AXP and AFP. The results show that the ballistic limit and perforation energy of the AXP is greatly affected by these parameters.

However, structural sandwich components have low resistance to out-of-plane impact due to the thin outer composite skins and the highly deformable cores. The present paper deals with a finite element study on the impact response of sandwich panels, obtained combining phenolic resin-based glass fiber reinforced plastics as skins and phenolic resin-impregnated aramid paper honeycomb structure (Nomex) as core. The numerical analysis has been performed using the LSDYNA software enabling to account for the main sandwich failure modes occurring during impact. The honeycomb core structure and composite skins have been modeled by means of solid and shell elements respectively. The properties of the finite element model have been calibrated on a series of experimental outcomes in order to achieve numerical parameters for both composite facesheet and orthotropic honeycomb material models. The major concerns are related to damage mechanisms, influence of strain-rate effects and energy absorbing capability. The model is validated using the results from experimental impact tests performed on different initial impact conditions. Good agreement was obtained between numerical and experimental results in terms of impact damage and force-displacement trend. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Damage mechanisms; Nomex; Numerical simulation; Phenolic sandwich structures","Composite sandwich structure; Damage mechanism; Energy absorbing capability; Finite-element study; High performance applications; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Nomex; Numerical parameters; Computer simulation; Failure (mechanical); Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Phenolic resins; Resins; Sandwich structures; Strain rate; Thermoelectricity; Honeycomb structures","Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, (1989); Meo, Michele, The response of honeycomb sandwich panels under low-velocity impact loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 47, 9, pp. 1301-1325, (2005); Anderson, Todd A., Experimental investigation of low-velocity impact characteristics of sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 50, 3, pp. 239-247, (2000); Aktay, Levent, Prediction of impact damage on sandwich composite panels, Computational Materials Science, 32, 3-4, pp. 252-260, (2005); Xia, Fan, Study on impact properties of through-thickness stitched foam sandwich composites, Composite Structures, 92, 2, pp. 412-421, (2010); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Perforation of honeycomb sandwich plates by projectiles, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 31, 8, pp. 889-899, (2000); Raju, Keshavanarayana S.S.Eswar, Impact damage resistance and tolerance of honeycomb core sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 42, 4, pp. 385-412, (2008); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Foo, Choon Chiang, Mechanical properties of Nomex material and Nomex honeycomb structure, Composite Structures, 80, 4, pp. 588-594, (2007)",""

Sandwich panels have the ability to dissipate energy through plastic deformation of the core and plates, making them more effective than a single metallic plate of similar density. A popular class of sandwich panels consists of metallic lattice cores that are sandwiched between solid plates. For these metallic lattice core panels, the ability to withstand blast loading depends on the core topology. In this study we investigate sandwich panels with different types of metallic lattice topologies and compare their performance under prescribed blast loads using nonlinear finite element simulations. A parametric study is carried out to evaluate performance indicators including: energy dissipated through plastic deformation, maximum force transferred, and plate deflections. Finally, based on the parametric studies recommendations are made for the use of these sandwich panels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast; Nonlinear finite element; Plasticity; Sandwich panels; Topology","Energy dissipated through plastic deformation; Metallic lattices; Non-linear finite elements; Nonlinear finite element simulation; Parametric study; Performance indicators; Plate deflections; Sandwich panel; Blasting; Plasticity; Sandwich structures; Topology; Honeycomb structures; deflection; deformation; finite element method; loading; performance assessment; plasticity; structural component; topology","Palanivelu, Sivakumar, Close-range blast loading on empty recyclable metal beverage cans for use in sacrificial cladding structure, Engineering Structures, 33, 6, pp. 1966-1987, (2011); Guruprasad, Siddalingappa, Layered sacrificial claddings under blast loading.

The dynamic responses of the AFSPs with various combinations of face-sheet materials were analyzed using LS-DYNA. It was found that the AFSP with an aluminum (AA2024 T3) front face and a Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) steel back face (labeled T3-AF-RHA) outperformed the other panel configurations in terms of maximum back face deflection (MaxD) and areal specific energy absorption (ASEA). It was also found that boundary conditions and the standoff distance (SoD) between an explosive and a target surface both have a remarkable influence on the blast response of the AFSPs. Using artificial neural network (ANN) approximation models, multi-objective design optimization (MDO) of the T3-AF-RHA panel was performed both with and without variations in blast load intensity. The optimization results show that the two objectives of MaxD minimization and ASEA maximization conflict with each other and that the optimal designs must be identified in a Pareto sense. Moreover, the Pareto curves obtained are different for varied blast impulse levels. Consequently, it is concluded that loading variation should be considered when designing such sandwich armors to achieve more robust blast-resistant performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast; Finite element; Impact; Optimization; Robustness; Sandwich","Approximation model; Impact; Multi-objective design optimization; Panel configurations; Rolled homogeneous armors; Sandwich; Specific energy absorption; Stand-off distance (SoD); Armor; Blasting; Dynamic response; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Military vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Optimization; Robustness (control systems); Sandwich structures; Explosives","(Gama) Haque, Bazle Z., Aluminum foam integral armor: A new dimension in armor design, Composite Structures, 52, 3-4, pp. 381-395, (2001); Fleck, Norman A., The resistance of clamped sandwich beams to shock loading, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 71, 3, pp. 386-401, (2004); Zhu, Feng, Analytical investigation and optimal design of sandwich panels subjected to shock loading, Materials and Design, 30, 1, pp. 91-100, (2009); Xue, Zhenyu, Preliminary assessment of sandwich plates subject to blast loads, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 45, 4, pp. 687-705, (2003); Xue, Zhenyu, A comparative study of impulse-resistant metal sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 30, 10, pp. 1283-1305, (2004); Zhu, Feng, Deformation and failure of blast-loaded metallic sandwich panels-Experimental investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 8, pp. 937-951, (2008); Nurick, Gerald N., Behaviour of sandwich panels subjected to intense air blast - Part 1: Experiments, Composite Structures, 91, 4, pp. 433-441, (2009); Zhu, Feng, Structural response and energy absorption of sandwich panels with an aluminium foam core under blast loading, Advances in Structural Engineering, 11, 5, pp. 525-536, (2008); Hanssen, Arve Grønsund, Close-range blast loading of aluminium foam panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 27, 6, pp. 593-618, (2002); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008)",""

The HSPs consisted of two identical aluminum alloy face-sheets and an aluminum honeycomb core featuring three types of unit cell configurations (regular, rectangular-shaped, and reentrant hexagons). The ballistic resistances of HSPs with the three core configurations were first analyzed. It was found that the HSP with the reentrant auxetic honeycomb core has the best ballistic resistance, due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the core. Parametric studies were then carried out to clarify the influences of both macroscopic (face-sheet and core thicknesses, core relative density) and mesoscopic (unit cell angle and size) parameters on the ballistic responses of the auxetic HSPs. Numerical results show that the perforation resistant capabilities of the auxetic HSPs increase as the values of the macroscopic parameters increase. However, the mesoscopic parameters show nonmonotonic effects on the panels' ballistic capacities. The empirical equations for projectile residual velocities were formulated in terms of impact velocity and the structural parameters. It was also found that the blunter projectiles result in higher ballistic limits of the auxetic HSPs. © 2013 Chang Qi et al.","","filler; honeycomb sandwich panel; unclassified drug; article; cell size; energy absorption; finite element analysis; relative density; thickness; velocity; ballistics; Poisson distribution; Forensic Ballistics; Poisson Distribution","Backman, Marvin E., The mechanics of penetration of projectiles into targets, International Journal of Engineering Science, 16, 1, pp. 1-99, (1978); Goldsmith, Werner, An experimental study of energy absorption in impact on sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 12, 2, pp. 241-262, (1992); Goldsmith, Werner, Axial perforation of aluminum honeycombs by projectiles, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 32, 8-9, pp. 1017-1046, (1995); Goldsmith, Werner, Perforation of cellular sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 19, 5-6, pp. 361-379, (1997); Mines, Robert A.W., Low velocity perforation behaviour of polymer composite sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 10, pp. 855-879, (1998); Alavi, Ali, Ballistic limit determination of aluminum honeycombs-Experimental study, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 488, 1-2, pp. 273-280, (2008); Meo, Michele, The response of honeycomb sandwich panels under low-velocity impact loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 47, 9, pp. 1301-1325, (2005); Crupi, Vincenzo, Collapse modes in aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels under bending and impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 6-15, (2012); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Perforation of honeycomb sandwich plates by projectiles, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 31, 8, pp. 889-899, (2000); Lin, Chunfu, Perforation of sandwich panels with honeycomb cores by hemispherical nose projectiles, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 7, 2, pp. 133-172, (2005)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

A continuum viscoplastic damage model, previously calibrated using microtensile test data for the aluminium alloy's optimally aged condition in conjunction with X-ray micro-tomography scans of the undeformed struts, was implemented through the user defined subroutine VUMAT. In addition, FE models of the open-cell metal foam core sandwich panel subject to three point and four point bending were produced in accordance with ASTM C-393-00, hence providing a virtual standardised test to assess the foam core elastic properties. These FE models used a tabulated elastic-plastic material model and were employed to verify the implementation of the damage model in the uniform compression FE simulations. The effect of two different types of morphological imperfections - fractured cell walls and missing cells - on the mechanical properties of the foam core was studied for uniform compression. The effect of these imperfections on the extent of visible structural damage of the foam core was studied for indentation loading scenarios indicative of an accidental tool strike under ground repair conditions, which is one important design consideration for potential alternative airplane wing skin materials. The effect of varying the indenter radius on the extent of visible structural damage was also considered so as to capture the influence of varying angles of tool drop impact. The Young's modulus and shear strength of the foam core experienced a significant knock-down effect under the presence of both fractured cell walls and missing cells. The extent of visible structural damage was largely unaffected by either type of defect or by varying the indenter radius. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, based on the existing aluminum honeycomb buffering and the model used in the landing-impact tests for the soft-landing system, a finite element model for the cantilever-type landing gear with four legs is established in MSC.Patran and submitted to MSC.Dytran to conduct a simulation analysis.

The spherically expanding sand shell is generated by detonating a sphere of explosive surrounded by a shell of either dry or water saturated synthetic sand. The measurements show that the sandwich panel and plate deflections decrease with increasing stand-off between the center of the charge and the front of the test structures. Moreover, for the same charge and sand mass, the deflections of the plates are significantly higher in the water saturated sand case compared to that of dry sand. For a given stand-off, the mid-span deflection of the sandwich panel rear faces was substantially less than that of the corresponding monolithic plate for both the dry and water saturated sand cases. The experiments were simulated via a coupled discrete-particle/ finite element scheme wherein the high velocity impacting sand is modeled by interacting particles while the plate is modeled within a Lagrangian finite element setting. The simulations are in good agreement with the measurements for the dry sand impact of both the monolithic and sandwich structures. However, the simulations underestimate the effect of stand-off in the case of the water saturated sand explosion, i.e. the deflections decrease more sharply with increasing stand-off in the experiments compared to the simulations. The simulations reveal that the momentum transmitted into the sandwich and monolithic plate structures by the sand shell is approximately the same, consistent with a small fluid-structure interaction effect. The smaller deflection of the sandwich panels is therefore primarily due to the higher bending strength of sandwich structures. © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The minimum dynamic cushioning coefficient is proposed to characterize the maximum energy absorption efficiency of staggered triangular honeycombs. When all configuration parameters are constant, the energy absorption per unit volume is proportional to the square of the impact velocity; for a given impact velocity, the energy absorption per unit volume is related to the ratio of the cellwall thickness to the edge length by a power lawand to the expanding angle by complicated analytical equations. The maximum energy absorption efficiency is insensitive to the impact velocity. Only for the smaller ratio of the cell wall thickness to the edge length does themaximumenergy absorption efficiency increase with the increasing expanding angle. At a given impact velocity there is a threshold ratio of the cell wall thickness to the edge length. Themaximum energy absorption efficiency decreases abruptly when the ratio is larger than the threshold. The threshold ratio is approximately equal to 0.04. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Energy absorption per unit volume; Finite-element analysis; Minimum dynamic cushioning coefficient; Staggered triangular honeycombs","Absorption efficiency; Absorption performance; Analytical equations; Configuration parameters; Energy absorption efficiency; Minimum dynamic cushioning coefficient; Per unit volume; Staggered triangular honeycombs; Crushing; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Velocity; Energy absorption; absorption; energy efficiency; finite element method; honey; power law","Ali, Muhammad, Theoretical and finite element study of a compact energy absorber, Advances in Engineering Software, 39, 2, pp. 95-106, (2008); Gao, Xin Lin, An exact elasto-plastic solution for a thick-walled spherical shell of elastic linear-hardening material with finite deformations, International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping, 57, 1, pp. 45-56, (1994); Gao, Xin Lin, Strain gradient plasticity solution for an internally pressurized thick-walled cylinder of an elastic linear-hardening material, Zeitschrift fur Angewandte Mathematik und Physik, 58, 1, pp. 161-173, (2007); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Grenestedt, Joachim L., Effective elastic behavior of some models for perfect cellular solids, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 36, 10, pp. 1471-1501, (1999); Harrigan, John J., Inertia effects in impact energy absorbing materials and structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 22, 9, pp. 955-979, (1999); Hohe, Jörg, Effective elastic properties of triangular grid structures, Composite Structures, 45, 2, pp. 131-145, (1999); Hohe, Jörg, Effective elastic properties of hexagonal and quadrilateral grid structures, Composite Structures, 46, 1, pp. 73-89, (1999); Hönig, A., In-plane dynamic crushing of honeycomb.

This study was conducted through the use of the finite element analysis, existing formulae and experiments. The damage and failure modes of composite sandwich panels were analyzed with some deliberation. With these results, damage and failure mode maps were compiled to facilitate the design of composite sandwich structures. Existing formulae that predict limit loads for damage modes which includes matrix shear/tension damage and core buckling, were reviewed and compiled to plot the damage mode map. The failure modes of facesheet cracking, overall core crushing and core shear fracture, were investigated to configure the failure mode map. Preferred damage and failure modes for impact resistance were also discussed in term of energy absorption. Extensive quasi-static indentation and low-velocity impact tests were carried out to verify these modes.

Thin-walled cellular structures (honeycomb) have the ability to absorb impact energy during crashing, thus it is important to enhance the crushing efficiency and optimise the structural reliability. The optimisation carried out in this study is aimed at maximising the energy absorption characteristics using meta-models while considering some limitation on the maximum force as a constraint. Achieving these characteristics is an important factor in crashworthiness analysis, which minimises the damage in dynamic performance. The objective of using various meta-models is to qualify the meta-model in crashworthiness analysis using different point selection schemes and different number of points. The optimisation is performed in two stages; through experimental design methods in which a set of sampling points is selected from design space and polynomial fitting in order to optimise the objective. It is concluded that D-optimal best suits response surface method for model approximation. Kriging performed best by space filling and the best point selection scheme for radial basis surrogate is latin hypercube design. The results show that for optimising the crashworthiness characteristics of honeycomb, Kriging and quadratic response surface (RS) are best, in terms of accuracy and robustness point of view and the radial basis neural network would be the second best. During this optimisation, the RS was combined with detailed geometrically simplified finite element model of honeycomb cell using ANSYS/LS-DYNA, LS-DYNA and LS-opt packages. Approximated functions combined with the finite element analysis were an effective tool to optimise highly non-linear impact problems. This has led to the development of validated algorithm that enabled the development of the optimised solutions. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","crashworthiness; latin hypercube design (LH-DOE); linear response surface method (L-RSM); quadratic response surface method (Q-RSM); radial basis function (RBF); radial basis neural network (RBNN)","Latin hypercube designs; Linear response; Quadratic response; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Radial basis neural networks; Crashworthiness; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Interpolation; Mathematical models; Optimization; Radial basis function networks; Surface properties; Structural design","Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Design and Manufacture, (2006); Shape Optimization of Plates to Mitigate the Effects of Air Blast Loading, (2009); Response Surface Methodology, (2004); Chiandussi, Giorgio, Maximisation of the crushing performance of a tubular device by shape optimisation, Computers and Structures, 80, 27-30, pp. 2425-2432, (2002); Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, (2002); Côté, François, The shear response of metallic square honeycombs, Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures, 1, 7, pp. 1281-1299, (2006); Dar, Fazilat H., Statistical methods in finite element analysis, Journal of Biomechanics, 35, 9, pp. 1155-1161, (2002); Deshpande, Vikram S., Collapse of truss core sandwich beams in 3-point bending, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 38, 36-37, pp. 6275-6305, (2001); Fang, Howie, Global response approximation with radial basis functions, Engineering Optimization, 38, 4, pp. 407-424, (2006); Forrester, Alexander I.J., Recent advances in surrogate-based optimization, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 45, 1-3, pp. 50-79, (2009)",""

Analysis of honeycomb material to reduce resulting accelerations is also presented where parameters such as honeycomb material modulus, wall thickness, cell geometry and structure depth are compared to the unprotected case. A simplified optimization analysis technique using a genetic algorithm is presented to demonstrate the use of this method to select a minimum honeycomb depth to achieve a desired acceleration level at a given level of input energy.

Finite element simulations were carried out using ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. In each case, a constant velocity was applied to the impact plate which then crushed the honeycomb. The values of the velocity were from 5 to 100. m/s. From the observation of the deformation profiles, three deformation modes have been identified when the strongest layer was placed at the impact end while two deformation modes have been found when the weaker layer was placed at the impact end. The critical velocities, at which the deformation modes transits were determined with a classification map. Dynamic stress and quasi-static plateau stress were obtained from the loading and the supporting plate, respectively. The stress-displacement curves were compared with the analytical prediction based on the shock wave theory. Then, the absorbed energy under constant velocity loading was investigated. To further investigate the influence of the stress gradient on the behavior of the graded honeycomb, different initial velocities versus the impinging mass were imposed on the impact plate. By considering a critical case, in which the velocity reduces to zero when the honeycomb structure is just fully crushed, the densification velocity was obtained.

Classical particle dampers are enclosures partially filled with small metallic or glass spheres, attached to a vibrating structure. The induced damping mechanism is mainly due to frictional losses and collision effects. This paper deals with replacing classical hard particles with soft hollow ones. This study is oriented toward experimental investigations and theoretical validation in order to distinguish dissipation phenomena. The experimental approach first relies on identifying the damping in small honeycomb samples filled with particles. Instead of dissipation by friction and impact, the elliptical shape of the measured hysteresis loops highlights that visco-elastic behavior is dominant with these specific soft particle dampers. Then, experimental and numerical validations are performed on aluminum honeycomb cantilever beams filled with particles. To take into account the effect of the particles, equivalent oscillators, based on the previous experimental damping identification, are added to a finite element model. These kinds of particle dampers are highly nonlinear as a function of excitation frequency and amplitude.

This concept has been explored here using a model 6061-T6 aluminum alloy system fabricated by friction stir weld joining extruded sandwich panels with a triangular corrugated core. Micro-hardness and miniature tensile coupon testing revealed that friction stir welding reduced the strength and ductility in the welds and a narrow heat affected zone on either side of the weld by approximately 30%. Square, edge clamped sandwich panels and solid plates of equal mass per unit area were subjected to localized impulsive loading by the impact of explosively accelerated, water saturated, sand shells. The hydrodynamic load and impulse applied by the sand were gradually increased by reducing the stand-off distance between the test charge and panel surfaces. The sandwich panels suffered global bending and stretching, and localized core crushing. As the pressure applied by the sand increased, face sheet fracture by a combination of tensile stretching and shear-off occurred first at the two clamped edges of the panels that were parallel with the corrugation and weld direction. The plane of these fractures always lay within the heat affected zone of the longitudinal welds. For the most intensively loaded panels additional cracks occurred at the other clamped boundaries and in the center of the panel. To investigate the dynamic deformation and fracture processes, a particle-based method has been used to simulate the impulsive loading of the panels. This has been combined with a finite element analysis utilizing a modified Johnson-Cook constitutive relation and a Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion that accounted for local variation in material properties. The fully coupled simulation approach enabled the relationships between the soil-explosive test charge design, panel geometry, spatially varying material properties and the panel's deformation and dynamic failure responses to be explored. This comprehensive study reveals the existence of a strong instability in the loading that results from changes in sand particle reflection during dynamic evolution of the panel's surface topology. Significant fluid-structure interaction effects are also discovered at the sample sides and corners due to changes of the sand reflection angle by the edge clamping system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Panels with polyurethane foam core and plain weave carbon fabric laminated face-sheets were subjected to low-velocity impact with hemispherical steel impactors of different diameters at various energy levels. Digital image correlation technique (a non-contact measuring system) was used to measure the real-time displacement and velocity of the impactor, and the back surface out-of-plane panel deflection time-history. A load sensor was used to record the contact force time-history. Non-destructive inspection and destructive sectioning methods were used to evaluate the internal and external damage on the sandwich panels after impact. The effects of impact variables such as impactor diameter, impact energy, and sandwich panel configuration parameters, such as face-sheet thickness and foam core thickness on the impact behavior and resulting impact damage states were studied. Based on the generalized Schapery theory, a progressive damage model is developed to describe the nonlinear behavior of plain weave carbon laminates during impact. The foam core was modeled as a crushable foam material. Coupon tests were conducted to determine the input parameters for the progressive damage model and the foam crushing properties. Three-dimensional finite element models were implemented to analyze the impact response incorporating the progressive damage model. Results from the numerical models were found to agree well with experimental observations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital image correlation; Low-velocity impact; Non-destructive inspection; Progressive damage; Sandwich panels; Schapery theory","Digital image correlations; Low velocity impact; Non destructive inspection; Progressive damage; Sandwich panel; Schapery theory; Carbon; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Image analysis; Laminates; Sandwich structures; Strain measurement; Velocity; Weaving; Three dimensional","Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Handbook of Sandwich Construction, (1997); Damage Resistance and Damage Tolerance of Thin Composite Facesheet Honeycomb Panels, (1989); Mines, Robert A.W., Low velocity perforation behaviour of polymer composite sandwich panels, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 10, pp. 855-879, (1998); Bhuiyan, Md A., Low-velocity impact response of sandwich composites with nanophased foam core and biaxial (± 45 °) braided face sheets, Composites Part B: Engineering, 40, 6, pp. 561-571, (2009); Hosur, Mahesh V., Manufacturing and low-velocity impact characterization of foam filled 3-D integrated core sandwich composites with hybrid face sheets, Composite Structures, 69, 2, pp. 167-181, (2005); Schubel, Patrick M., Low velocity impact behavior of composite sandwich panels, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 36, 10 SPEC.

Several one-dimensional shock models have been developed to explain these features. A unified framework of one-dimensional plastic shock wave models was established in this paper. Based on an arbitrary plastic hardening constitutive model for cellular materials, general solutions, although implicit, have been derived for two impact scenarios. For a rigid-power-law hardening (R-PLH) idealisation involved in three material parameters, namely the yield stress, the strength index and the strain-hardening index, closed-form/semi-closed-form solutions of the physical quantities across the shock front have been derived. The linearly hardening and locking idealisations are found to correspond to the two opposite limit cases with the strain-hardening index of one and infinity, respectively. The shock models based on three different idealisations are verified with cell-based finite element models including an irregular honeycomb and a closed-cell foam. It is found that the force responses predicted by the shock models are not very sensitive to the choice of the idealisations and they are in good agreement with the cell-based finite element results. Deformation features predicted by the shock models are compared well with the cell-based results when the impact velocity is not very low. The comparisons show that using more realistic constitutive models such as the R-PLH idealisation may present more accurate predictions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Catalytically decomposed hydrogen peroxide results in a steam-oxygen mixture at elevated temperature and can be used either as a monopropellant or as an oxidizer in a bipropellant system. To guide the monolith catalyst design, a lumped parameter model of the decomposition implemented into a numerical thermal model has been developed. The one dimensional flow model includes decomposition and is coupled to a finite element structural domain of the decomposition chamber and catalyst to investigate the impact of the catalyst and the chamber structure on the decomposition behavior. Special focus is laid on the transitional behavior of hydrogen peroxide conversion to facilitate immediate start-up of the thruster system after valve opening command.

It was found that the strain rate effects of the materials and the concrete material model could have significant effect on the numerically predicted flexural strength and tensile membrane resistance of the panels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Impact load; Protective structures; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich panels","Concrete materials; Dynamic testing; Finite element models; Flexural response; High speed vehicles; Impact loadings; Impact loads; Impact response; Large deformations; LS-DYNA; Non-composite; Protective structures; Sandwich panel; Shear studs; Simulation and validation; Steel plates; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich; Strain rate effect; Tensile membrane; Computer simulation; Sandwich structures; Tensile strength; Honeycomb structures","Design Guide for Steel Concrete Steel Sandwich Construction General Principles and Rules for Basic Elements, (1994); Oduyemi, T.

For example, during NASA's recent efforts to develop new launch vehicles, composite materials were considered and baselined for a number of structures, including dry barrel sections, which are primarily loaded in longitudinal compression. Because of mass and stiffness requirements, sandwich composites are often selected for these applications. However, there are a number of manufacturing and in-service concerns associated with traditional honeycomb-core sandwich composites that in certain instances may be alleviated through the use of other core materials or construction methods. A fluted core, which consists of integral angled web members with structural radius fillers spaced between laminate facesheets, is one such construction alternative. In this paper, two different fluted-core composite designs were considered: a subscale design and a full-scale design sized for a heavy-lift-launch-vehicle interstage. In particular, the longitudinal compression behavior of fluted-core composites was evaluated with experiments and finite-element analyses. Detailed branched-shell finite-element models were developed, and geometrically nonlinear analyses were conducted to predict both buckling and material failures. Good agreement was obtained between test data and analysis predictions for both failure types. Though the local buckling events are not catastrophic, the resulting deformations contribute to material failures. Consequently, neither the local buckling behavior nor the material failure loads and modes can be predicted by either linear analyses or nonlinear smeared-shell analyses. Compression-after-impact performance of fluted-core composites was also investigated experimentally. Nondestructive inspection of the damage zones indicated that the detectable damage was limited to no more than one flute on either side of any given impact. More study is needed, but this may indicate that an inherent damagearrest capability of fluted core could provide benefits over traditional sandwich designs in certain weight-critical applications.

The experiments were conducted using two loading methods: (i) the waveloading device (WLD) method and (ii) the direct impact method (DIM). The specimens were subjected to crush velocities of about 12 000 mm s-1 in the WLD method and 5000 mm s-1 in the DIM. The two methods were used to obtain a fairly wide range of input velocities. The collapse sequence and displacement information of the specimens were captured using a high-speed camera. The mode of collapse was through progressive concertina-diamond fold formation over a fairly constant state of load, which is referred to as the crush load. The crushing was simulated using an explicit FE analysis using ABAQUS, with geometrically imperfect 3-cell and 7-cell honeycomb models that incorporated the rate-dependent properties of polycarbonate. The FE results were found to agree well with the experimental results in terms of overall force-displacement plots, thus providing a basis to extract energy absorption estimates from the models and to draw comparisons between the 3-cell and 7-cell response behaviour. Moreover, the dynamic crush results were compared against a quasi-static axial crush response to demonstrate the presence of rate effects. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Circular honeycombs; Direct impact method; Explicit finite-element analysis; Waveloading device","ABAQUS; Cells; Computer simulation; Cytology; Honeycomb structures; Loading; Polycarbonates; Axial crushes; Circular cell honeycomb; Circular honeycombs; Crush load; Direct impact; Displacement information; FE analysis; Finite-element; Force-displacement; Honeycomb models; Input velocity; Quasi-static; Rate effects; Response behaviour; Waveloading device; Finite element method","Babcock, Charles D., Shell stability, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 50, 4, pp. 935-940, (1983); Baker, William E., Static and dynamic properties of high-density metal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 3, pp. 149-163, (1998); Buckling of Bars Plates and Shells, (1975); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Goldsmith, Werner, An experimental study of energy absorption in impact on sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 12, 2, pp. 241-262, (1992); Hong, Sungtae, Dynamic crush behaviors of aluminum honeycomb specimens under compression dominant inclined loads, International Journal of Plasticity, 24, 1, pp. 89-117, (2008); Hou, Bing, Impact behavior of honeycombs under combined shear-compression.

To evaluate the feasibility of using short sisal fibres as reinforcements in the composites, existing micromechanical models have been used to predict properties starting from the intrinsic properties of its constituents. The stress relaxation behaviour of the composites was examined experimentally by performing tensile stress relaxation tests and to understand the process, it was modelled using variations of Maxwell's model. A steady-state finite element analysis in the linear range was performed in ANSYS environment to examine flexural properties of the panels, and the shear strength of the hollow cores was experimentally determined by subjecting them to flexural loads in a four-point bending scheme. The micromechanics models indicated that the fibres had failed to provide effective reinforcements with their existing lengths, acting as fillers rather than reinforcements. The stress relaxation models indicated that the formed part needs to be cooled to room temperature within the die under suitable forming loads to avoid local deformations due to warping. The mid-span deflections of the sandwich panels predicted by the FE model agree well with the experimental results, the analysis predicted facing buckling as a mode of failure when wood veneers facings of modulus 4.5 GPa and thickness 1.7 mm were used.

The sandwich beams were made from carbon fibre laminate and comprised identical face sheets and a square-honeycomb core. The transient deflection of the beams was determined as a function of projectile momentum, and the measured response was compared with finite element simulations based upon a damage mechanics approach. A range of failure modes were observed in the sandwich beams including core fracture, plug-type shear failure of the core, debonding of the face sheets from the core and tensile tearing of the face sheets at the supports. In contrast, the monolithic beams failed by a combination of delamination of the plies and tensile failure at the supports. The finite element simulations of the beam response were accurate provided the carbon fibre properties were endowed with rate sensitivity of damage growth. The relative performance of monolithic and sandwich beams were quantified by the maximum transverse deflection at mid-span for a given projectile momentum. It was found that the sandwich beams outperformed both monolithic composite beams and steel sandwich beams with a square-honeycomb core. However, the composite beams failed catastrophically at a lower projectile impulse than the steel beams due to the lower ductility of the composite material. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact response of plain foam samples and their associated sandwich panels was characterised by determining the energy required to perforate the panels. The dynamic response of the panels was predicted using the finite element analysis package ABAQUS/Explicit. The experimental arrangement, as well as the FE model were also used to investigate, for the first time, the effect of oblique loading on sandwich structures and also to study the impact response of sandwich panels on an aqueous support.Testing has shown that the perforation resistance of the plain foams and their sandwich panels is strongly dependent on the properties of the foam core. For example, increasing the density of the crosslinked PVC foams from 60 to 200kg/m 3 yielded an eight fold increase in the perforation resistance of the sandwich panels. At intermediate and higher densities, the crosslinked PVC foams and their associated sandwich structures offered a superior perforation resistance to their linear PVC counterparts. The FE analysis reasonably predicted the impact load-displacement responses and the perforation energies of both the plain foams and the sandwich panels. Finally, it has been shown that sandwich panels impacted in an aqueous environment offer a lower perforation resistance than those tested in air. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","A. Glass fibres; B.

This study differentiates itself from that of Fleck & Deshpande in that the ""conservation of momentum"" method instead of the ""energy balance"" method is adopted to model the ""compaction stage"" of the core upon impact loading. Finite element method (FEM) is used to validate the developed analytical model and good agreement between the analytical method and FEM results is observed. Obtained results also show that, compared to the Fleck & Deshpande model, the present model gives improved predictions of the maximum lateral deflection of the front face and the boundary of the two regions where the cellular core is totally compacted and partly compacted. The developed model is then applied to study the effects of core relative density and core thickness on the maximum impulsive momentum that the sandwich beam can sustain (impact resistance), and near-optimum design is identified for a regular hexagonal core sandwich beam with given mass. In addition, based on the present model, the performance of sandwich beams with self-similar hierarchical hexagonal honeycomb cores under impact loading is studied. It is shown that, for given relative density, the strength of the self-similar hierarchical hexagonal honeycomb decreases with the hierarchical order increasing. Therefore, both the energy absorbed per unit mass of the core during the compaction stage and the impact resistance of the sandwich beam decrease as the hierarchical order increases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, adding waste tyres as a dispersive phase in polymeric composites has shown high toughness and moderate increase of mechanical strength within the composites. In this work, we investigate the use of recycled rubber core to manufacture auxetic (re-entrant) honeycomb structures. The re-entarnt honeycombs produced are evaluated using finite element analysis and tensile in-plane to assess the sensitivity of the mechanical properties versus the cell geometric parameters. A full factorial design (33) was performed to investigate the effects of the factors width (10 and 20mm), thickness (2 and 4mm) and angle (-10 and -20°) on Poisson's ratio of honeycomb structures. The results give further evidence that the Poisson's ratio is affected not only by individual factors but also by interaction originated by the other geometric parameters. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

High fidelity finite element models for axially restrained SCS panels subjected to impact loading conditions were developed using LS-DYNA. The simulation results were validated against the dynamic testing experimental results.

Taken together, these tests provide an assessment of the potential of this composite topology for use as a lightweight sandwich core. The honeycombs had two relative densities, 0.12 and 0.24, and two material orientations, ±45° and 0/90° with respect to the prismatic, loading direction of the honeycomb. Honeycomb manufacture was by slotting, assembling and bonding together carbon fibre/epoxy woven plies of composite sheets of 2 × 2 twill weave construction. The peak value of wall stress in the honeycombs was about one third that of the parent material, for all strain rates. An elastic finite element analysis was used to trace the source of this knock-down in strength: a stress concentration exists at the root of the slots and leads to premature failure by microbuckling. Shock-wave effects were evident at impact velocities exceeding 50 ms-1 for the honeycomb of relative density 0.12. This was traced to stubbing of the buckled cell walls against the face of the Kolsky bar. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Carbon fibre; A. Honeycomb; B. Impact behaviour; E.

Three tube configurations are investigated, as-received tubes, tubes with circular cut-out on opposite sides, and tubes with dents on opposite sides. The imperfections are located at the mid-section of the tube. The outer skin of the sandwich panel is 150×150×10 mm in cross-section and non-deformable. Quasi-static tests carried out on two and three tubes laid out in parallel between the skin indicate that the axial forces is a multiple of the axial force of a single tube, as expected. Consequently, the sandwich panel with the nine tubes deforms less than the sandwich panels with five and four tubes when subjected to similar impact energy. Triggers in the tubes improve the collapse mode of the sandwich panels.

The potential debonding at the interfaces between the corrugated cores and face sheets because of the service-load condition specific to bridge engineering at low temperatures and its impact on stiffness are studied in this paper. The finite-element analysis (FEA) was utilized to determine the load in the experiment. The experiment consisted of tests conducted at four different temperatures. The load-strain responses were monitored to study the behaviors of HFRP sandwich panels. On the basis of the observation and results from the experiment, this paper concludes that the deflection limit span over 400 can potentially be adopted in practice without incurring stiffness degradation because of interface debonding. The paper also shows that it is essential to study the tolerable size of cracks or defects at the interfaces before applying this deflection limit as a design criterion. The experimental results in this study serve as a necessary supplement to the material tests and confirm that the stiffness of the HFRP sandwich panels at the structural level will also increase when the temperatures are decreased at least up to the service-limit state. Finally, this paper verifies the important role that tensile stress plays in interface debonding and suggests that previous tests may underestimate the actual shear strength of the interfaces. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Debonding; FEA; Interfacial stress states; Low-temperature effects; Service load","Bridge engineering; Combined effect; Corrugated core; Deflection-limit; Design criterion; Experimental studies; Face sheets; Fiber reinforced polymers; Interface debonding; Interfacial stress states; Low temperatures; Material tests; Sandwich panel; Service loads; Stiffness degradation; Beams and girders; Behavioral research; Bridges; Cracks; Debonding; Experiments; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Low temperature effects; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Tensile strength; Structural design","Aashto Lrfd Bridge Design Specifications, (1998); Alagusundaramoorthy, Paramasivan, Structural behavior of FRP composite bridge deck panels, Journal of Bridge Engineering, 11, 4, pp. 384-393, (2006); Alampalli, Sreenivas, Fiber reinforced polymer composites for the superstructure of a short-span rural bridge, Composite Structures, 58, 1, pp. 21-27, (2002); Fracture Mechanics Fundamentals and Applications, (1995); Standard Test Method for Core Shear Properties of Sandwich Constructions by Beam Flexure, (2025); Mixed Mode Decohesion Finite Elements for the Simulation of Delamination in Composite Materials, (2002); Chen, An, Behavior of Honeycomb FRP Sandwich Sinusoidal Core Panels with Skin Effect, pp. 625-632, (2004); Davalos, Julio F., Modeling and characterization of fiber-reinforced plastic honeycomb sandwich panels for highway bridge applications, Composite Structures, 52, 3-4, pp. 441-452, (2001); Dutta, Piyush K., Low-temperature and freeze-thaw durability of thick composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 27, 3-4, pp. 371-379, (1996); Ji, Hyoseon, Design, test and field application of a GFRP corrugated-core sandwich bridge, Engineering Structures, 32, 9, pp. 2814-2824, (2010)",""

The optimised architecture of this class in conjunction with additional benefits of high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios vital to weight-sensitive military applications has led to numerous research works on the topic. In this study, the dynamic response of four circular sandwich panel constructions with different core designs under global and local blast loading conditions has been investigated. Numerical finite element (FE) models have been set up to study the effect of additional core interlayers on blast resistance enhancement of these sandwich panels. The objectives are (1) to assess the existing blast resistance capacity, (2) to increase the dynamic energy absorption, (3) to improve the stress distribution through plastic deformation, and (4) to ensure sacrificial damage to the additional core layers; hence, to avoid the main part of the core being damaged by excessive shear deformation, the dominant failure mode in conventional sandwich panels. A ductile elastomeric layer of polyurea, and a fairly compressible Divinycell-H200 foam layer have been selected as the additional core interlayers, and they have been placed in different arrangements to improve the overall blast resistance of the standard sandwich panel with glass-fibre-reinforced plastic (GFRP) face-sheets, and balsawood core. Dynamic explicit FE analyses were carried out using the commercial package ABAQUS 6.9-1. Comparison of specific kinetic and strain energies shows the effect of additional core layers on the blast energy absorption of a sandwich system. The study shows the improvement in shear failure prevention of the core as a result of the use of additional core layers and a reduction in the level of kinetic and strain energies in the protected core in both absolute and relative terms. The stress contours show a smoother stress distribution in enhanced cases. These conclusions are confirmed and explained by using a qualitative two-degree-of-freedom system with an elastic-viscoplastic spring element representing the integral effects of sacrificial additional core interlayers and a nonlinear spring representing the stiffness of the conventional sandwich system and comparing the results of dynamic analysis with a similar qualitative single-degree-of-freedom model of a conventional sandwich panel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast resistance; Finite element analysis (FEA); Qualitative model; Sandwich panel","Blast loading; Blast loads; Commercial packages; Core design; Core layers; Dynamic energy absorption; Dynamic explicit; Elastic viscoplastic; FE analysis; Finite element analysis (FEA); Finite element models; Foam layers; Impact threat; Loading environment; Nonlinear springs; Polyureas; Qualitative model; Resistance capacity; Resistance enhancement; Sandwich panel; Sandwich system; Set-ups; Shear failure; Single-degree-of-freedom; Spring element; Stiffness-to-weight ratios; Stress contours; Two-degree-of-freedom system; ABAQUS; Absorption; Deformation; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic response; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Military applications; Quality control; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Strain energy; Stress concentration; Blast resistance; blasting; deformation; dynamic analysis; dynamic response; finite element method; kinetic energy; loading; numerical model; plastic deformation; qualitative analysis; stiffness; strain rate; stress analysis; structural analysis; structural component","Wang, A.

A porthole extrusion process followed by friction stir welding was utilized to fabricate 6061-T6 aluminum sandwich panels with corrugated cores. The panels were edge clamped and subjected to localized high intensity dynamic loading by the detonation of spherical explosive charges encased by a concentric shell of wet sand placed at different standoff distances. Monolithic plates of the same alloy and mass per unit area were also tested in an identical manner and found to suffer 15-20% larger permanent deflections. A decoupled wet sand loading model was developed and incorporated into a parallel finite-element simulation capability. The loading model was calibrated to one of the experiments. The model predictions for the remaining tests were found to be in close agreement with experimental observations for both sandwich panels and monolithic plates. The simulation tool was then utilized to explore sandwich panel designs with improved performance. It was found that the performance of the sandwich panel to wet sand blast loading can be varied by redistributing the mass among the core webs and the face sheets.

This paper firstly investigates the energy absorption characteristics of honeycomb-filled single and bitubular polygonal tubes (HSBPT) by nonlinear finite element analysis through LS-DYNA. By employing a six-level judgement method, we find that both of the honeycomb-filled single and honeycomb-filled bitubular tubes with enneagonal configuration have very excellent energy absorption characteristics among the considered cases. Next, the HSBPTs with enneagonal configuration are optimized by adopting multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to achieve maximum specific energy absorption (SEA) capacity and minimum peak crushing force (PCF). During the process of multiobjective optimization design (MOD), accurate metamodels of SEA and PCF of the HSBPTs with enneagonal configuration are established to reduce the computational cost of crash simulations by finite element method. Numerical experiments show that the quartic polynomial functions of SEA and PCF are the suitable metamodels for both honeycomb-filled single and bitubular enneagonal tubes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","A.

Through a comprehensive numerical study it was found that sandwich honeycomb panels with BVID fail due to wrinkling or core crushing at significantly lower loads than undamaged panels. The critical load is controlled by the depth and size of damage, both of which control the foundation support and the resistance to wrinkles forming. In this article a simplified, closed-form analytical model is developed to predict critical stresses through a complete range of damage sizes and depths. This model extends previous work [1] by finding an expression for the critical wrinkling wavelength in a closed-form solution. A further expression is developed to account for rotational support at the edge of the damage site, as the wrinkle approaches the critical wrinkling wavelength. This article concludes by comparing numerical and analytical models against experimental values. Very good agreement is seen in all cases. © The Author(s), 2011.","damage; honeycomb; impact; residual; sandwich; strength","damage; honeycomb; impact; residual; sandwich; strength; Computer simulation; Honeycomb structures; Mathematical models; Models; Sandwich structures; Finite element method","Staal, R.

Sandwich facesheet materials discussed are unidirectional and woven carbon/epoxy, and woven glass/vinylester composite laminates; sandwich core materials investigated include four types of closed cell PVC foams of various densities, aluminum honeycomb, polyurethane foam, foam-filled honeycomb, and balsa wood. These materials were fully characterized under quasi-static loading and, in some cases, under high strain loading conditions as well. Sandwich beams were tested in an instrumented drop tower system under various energy levels, where load and strain histories and failure modes were recorded for the various types of beams. Peak loads predicted by spring-mass and energy balance models were in satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements. Failure patterns depend strongly on the impact energy levels and core properties. Failure modes observed include core indentation/cracking, facesheet buckling, delamination within the facesheet, and debonding between the facesheet and core. Sandwich beams with PVC cores tend to be more stable than beams with different cores. Although sandwich beams with balsa wood cores perform well under static loading, they fail catastrophically under impact loading due to the low fracture toughness along the grain direction. Sandwich beams with honeycomb cores show early catastrophic failure caused by the lack of continuity of the interface between the honeycomb core and the facesheet, resulting in debonding failure. In the case of sandwich panels, it was shown that static and impact loads of the same magnitude produce very similar far-field deformations. The induced damage is localized and is lower for impact loading than for an equivalent static loading. Static testing in general is more conservative regarding strain and damage levels. The load history, predicted by a model based on the sinusoidal shape of the impact load pulse, was in agreement with experimental results. A finite element model was implemented to capture the full response of the panel indentation. The investigation of post-impact behavior of sandwich structures shows that, although impact damage may not be readily visible, its effects on the residual mechanical properties of the structure can be quite detrimental. © 2010 Springer-Verlag US.","Carbon fiber composites; Damage modes; Damage tolerance; Glass fiber composites; Impact behaviour; Impact damage modeling; Postimpact behaviour; Sandwich core properties; Sandwich panels","","Fabrication Testing and Analysis of Composite Sandwich Beams, (2000); Abot, Jandro L., Composite sandwich beams under low-velocity impact, (2001); Proc of 16th Conference of the American Society for Composites Asc16, (2001); Abot, Jandro L., Impact behavior of sandwich beams with various composite facesheets and balsa wood core, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Applied Mechanics Division, AMD, 247, pp. 55-69, (2001); Abot, Jandro L., Contact Law for Composite Sandwich Beams, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 4, 2, pp. 157-173, (2002); Abrate, Serge, Localized impact on sandwich structures with laminated facings, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 50, 2, pp. 69-82, (1997); Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Abrate, Serge, Modeling of impacts on composite structures, Composite Structures, 51, 2, pp. 129-138, (2001); Advanced Composite Compression Tests, (1988); Ambur, Damodar R., Low-speed impact response characteristics of composite sandwich panels, Collection of Technical Papers - AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, 4, pp. 2681-2689, (1995)",""

FE simulations demonstrate, when all configuration parameters are kept constant, mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses are related to impact velocities by conic curves. For a given impact velocity, mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses are related to the ratios between cell wall thickness and edge length and to edge length ratios by power laws. There are complicated relations between mean out-of-plane dynamic plateau stresses and expanding angels, which are discussed in detail.

In web core panels, the interaction between the webs and core material can have a substantial impact on web shear buckling strength and is a key element of lightweight structural design. The present work is an investigation of web buckling behavior in web core panels under a distributed load. To solve this problem, web shear buckling was analyzed for the case of pure shear loading with foam support, and this analytic model was extended to the case of panels with a transverse distributed load. The webs are modeled as simply supported plates resting on a Pasternak elastic foundation. To that end, a buckling model for plates on a Pasternak foundation is presented, along with closed-form approximations of the solution for square and infinitely long plates. An accurate model for the foundation constants is developed using energy methods. Applicability of the plate buckling model to web core panels with transverse loads is presented via a finite element study. In panels, the slenderness and spacing of the webs have a slight effect on the boundary conditions between the webs and face sheets. The effect is relatively small, however, and the model presented in this work underpredicts buckling strength by less than 25%. The model in this work is thus a reasonable approach to the practical design of web core panels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For the car to be competitive, any impact-absorbing structure must be lightweight and hence many teams use aluminium honeycomb inside the car's frontal nose cone. This paper considers an alternative approach based on an array of thin-walled circular tubes attached to the front bulkhead of the car. Experiments have been conducted at the University of Leeds to study the behaviour of empty and honeycomb-filled tubes subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading. Aluminium (6063 T6 alloy) tubes filled with Nomex HRH-10 honeycomb were employed in the current study. The experimental programme included five quasi-static tests and four dynamic tests. It was found that the honeycomb-filled tubes absorbed around 10% more energy than the empty tubes. However, the specific energy absorption (SEA) was found to be 15% less than for the empty tubes for the same axial deformation in all the test cases. Numerical simulations have been carried out using the explicit finite element code RADIOSS. Confidence in the present modelling procedure was established through comparison of the numerical results with test data. An excellent correlation of peak loads and energy absorption has been obtained for both empty and honeycomb-filled tubes. Thus, the modelling procedure outlined here can be used with confidence to design the proposed impact attenuator structure and to demonstrate that it meets the crashworthiness requirements of the competition. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","empty and honeycomb-filled aluminium tubes; energy absorption; impact attenuators; RADIOSS","Alternative approach; Aluminium honeycomb; Aluminium tubes; Axial deformations; Car designs; Circular tubes; Dynamic tests; empty and honeycomb-filled aluminium tubes; Explicit finite element codes; Formula SAE; Frontal impacts; Impact-absorbing; Numerical results; Numerical simulation; Peak load; Quasi-static; Quasi-static tests; Society of automotive engineers; Specific energy absorption; Test case; Test data; Thin-walled; University of Leeds; Absorption; Aluminum; Competition; Computer simulation; Crashworthiness; Dynamic loads; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Numerical analysis; Testing; Tubes (components)","Al Galib, D., Experimental and numerical investigation of static and dynamic axial crushing of circular aluminum tubes, Thin-Walled Structures, 42, 8, pp. 1103-1137, (2004); Radioss Theory Manual, (2005); Chirwa, Efford Clive, Carbon skinned aluminium foam nose cones for high performance circuit vehicles, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 8, 1, pp. 107-114, (2003); Hanssen, Arve Grønsund, Static and dynamic crushing of circular aluminum extrusions with aluminum foam filler, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 24, 5, pp. 475-507, (2000); Hsu, S.

The term high velocity impact is used to describe impact scenarios where the projectile perforates the panel and exits with a residual velocity. The solution is derived from a wave propagation model involving deformation and failure of facesheets, through-thickness propagation of shock waves in the core, and through-thickness core shear failure. Equations of motion for the projectile and effective masses of the facesheets and core as the shock waves travel through sandwich panel are derived using Lagrangian mechanics. The analytical approach is mechanistic involving no detail account of progressive damage due to delamination and debonding but changes in the load-bearing resistance of the sandwich panel due to failure and complete loss of resistance from the facesheets and core during projectile penetration. The predicted transient deflection and velocity of the projectile and sandwich panel compared fairly well with results from finite element analysis. Analytical predictions of the projectile residual velocities were also found to be in good agreement with experimental data. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic nonlinear transient analysis was also carried out by a finite element simulation model developed based on continuum damage mechanics to account for nonlinear and elastoplastic behavior. The results revealed that while the impact behaviors of AHSPs were nearly the same for low impact energy, they were different for high impact energy. The peak resistance force of AHSPs was the highest for impact at the face center and the lowest for impact at the short edge of the core cells.

Many experimental researches on the dynamic behavior and rate sensitivity of cellular metals have been reported in the literature, but they contain conflicting, and sometimes confusing, conclusions on the strain-rate and inertia effect of cellular metals. In this paper, the dynamic crushing behavior of 2D Voronoi honeycomb is studied by finite element method. The influences of inertia, strain hardening and strain-rate hardening of metal matrix on the deformation mode and plateau stress of the honeycomb are investigated. Three deformation modes are found in different velocity ranges. According to the numerical results, it is found that the plateau stress increases significantly with the increase of impact velocity due to non-uniform deformation induced by inertia. The strain-hardening effect is slight in our numerical tests and the rate effect of the honeycomb is obviously weaker than that of the cell wall material. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the finite element (FE) model by using ANSYS/LS-DYNA was to investigate the relations between configuration parameters of DHHCs and their mean in-plane plateau stresses at impact velocities from 3 to 250 m/s. When all configuration parameters are kept constant, mean in-plane dynamic plateau stresses are proportional to the square of impact velocities. For the given impact velocity, mean in-plane dynamic plateau stresses are related to the ratios between cell wall thicknesses and cell edge length by power laws, to cell edge length ratios by exponential laws and to expanding angels by conic curves. Based on the FE calculated results, many empirical formulas and a feasible method to be used to calculate mean in-plane dynamic and static plateau stresses of DHHCs are suggested.

The sandwich composite used for the vehicle structures was composed of aluminum honeycomb core and WR580/NF4000 glass-fabric/epoxy laminate facesheets. Material tests were conducted to determine the input parameters of the composite laminate facesheet model and the effective equivalent damage model for the orthotropic honeycomb core material. Crashworthiness and rollover analysis of the low-floor bus was conducted using the explicit finite element method (FEM) analysis code LS-DYNA3D with the lapse of time. The crash condition of the low-floor bus was a frontal accident with a speed of 60 km/h. Rollover analysis was done according to the safety rules of the European standards (ECE-R66). The angular and translation velocity and its angle with the ground just before impact for rollover were calculated using the dynamic analysis program. The results showed that the survival spaces for the driver and passengers were secured against frontal crashworthiness and rollover of the low-floor bus. In addition, the modified Chang-Chang failure criterion is recommended to predict the failure modes of the composite structures for crashworthiness and rollover analysis. © The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009.","Crashworthiness analysis; Effect equivalent damage model; Honeycomb sandwich composite; Rollover analysis","Aluminum honeycomb; Composite laminate; Effect equivalent damage model; Equivalent damage; European Standards; Explicit finite element method; Facesheets; Failure criteria; Honeycomb core; Honeycomb sandwich composite; Input parameter; Low-floor bus; LS-DYNA3D; Material tests; Numerical evaluations; Rollover analysis; Safety rules; Sandwich composites; Translation velocity; Vehicle structures; Alumina; Buses; Coremaking; Crashworthiness; Dynamic analysis; Failure analysis; Floors; Honeycomb structures; Program translators; Structure (composition); Quality assurance","Intercity Bus Weight Reduction Program, (2000); Foo, Choon Chiang, A model to predict low-velocity impact response and damage in sandwich composites, Composites Science and Technology, 68, 6, pp. 1348-1356, (2008); Kim, Jung-seok, Manufacturing and structural safety evaluation of a composite train carbody, Composite Structures, 78, 4, pp. 468-476, (2007); Korean Society of Automotive Engineers, (2007); Rollover and Roof Crush Analysis of Low Floor Mass Transit Bus, (2002); Korean Society for Composite Materials, (2007); Nguyen, Minh Q., Simulation of impact on sandwich structures, Composite Structures, 67, 2 SPEC.

Each model was divided into several cell regions by inclusion lines. The analysis revealed the effect of inclusion lines on the mean stress of the cell region, maximum displacement of the cell region, and the order of deformed cell regions. Maximum displacement of the cell region was proportional to the width of the cell region, and mean stress of the cell region decreased as the width of the cell region increased. Approximate equations for the maximum displacement and mean stress of the cell region were derived. The approximations accounted for the deformation process of the honeycomb models with inclusion lines and revealed the dependence of the order of the deformed cell region on the mean stress of the regions.

This allows implementation into existing commercial finite elements codes, preserving their program structure. As customary, the Hertzian law and the Newmark implicit time integration scheme are used for solving the contact problem. The contact radius and the force are computed within each time step by an iterative algorithm which forces the impacted top surface to conform, in the least-squares sense, to the shape of the impactor.

Based on the experiments, corresponding finite element simulations have been undertaken using the LS-DYNA software. Detailed description of the models and simulation results is presented. In the simulation work, the loading process of explosive and response of the sandwich panels have been investigated. The blast loading process includes both the explosion procedure of the charge and the interaction with the panel. The structural responses of sandwich panels are studied in terms of two aspects: (1) deformation/failure patterns of the specimens; and (2) quantitative assessment, which mainly focuses on the permanent centre point deflection of the back face of the panels. In addition, a parametric study has been carried out to examine the contribution of plastic stretching and bending on the deformation history of the sandwich panels, as well as the effect of boundary conditions. A good agreement has been obtained between the numerical and experimental results, and thus the proposed FE model can be considered as a valuable tool in assessing and understanding the deformation/failure mechanism and predicting the dynamic response of square metallic sandwich structures subjected to blast loading. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This type of damage can cause panels to fail at significantly lower loads than an equivalent undamaged panel. For this reason, impact damage in sandwich structures has been a focus for numerous studies, including those that examine damage tolerance of structures and also their post-impact residual strength. This study specifically examines thin-gauge Nomex honeycomb panels and is concerned with barely visible impact damage (BVID), the type of damage that can be found on aircraft components. An overview of BVID, including an in-depth examination of the failure modes and failure loads of damaged panels is presented in this article. The study uses nonlinear finite element models to accurately predict failure loads, and understand how this type of damage causes panels to fail at reduced loads. A simplified, closed-form analytical model is developed to predict failure stresses through a complete range of damage sizes and depths. This study finishes by comparing numerical and analytical models against experimental values. Good agreement is seen in all cases for a wide variety of damage sizes. © SAGE Publications 2009.","Failure; Honeycomb; Impact Damage; Sandwich; Wrinkling","Failure; Honeycomb; Impact Damage; Sandwich; Wrinkling; Aircraft; Computer simulation; Failure analysis; Gages; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Sandwich structures; Damage tolerance","Damage Due to Soft Body Impact on Composite Sandwich Aircraft Panels, (2000); Boeing 747 400 Structural Repair Manual D634u102 Rev 68, (2009); Proceedings of the AIAA ASME ASCE AHS ASC 32nd Structures Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, (1991); Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Review of Damage Tolerance for Composite Sandwich Airframe Structures, (1999); Failure of Sandwich Honeycomb Panels in Bending, (2006); An Introduction to Sandwich Construction, (1995); Kassapoǵlou, Christos, Buckling, post-buckling and failure of elliptical delaminations in laminates under compression, Composite Structures, 9, 2, pp. 139-159, (1988); Kassapoǵlou, Christos, Compression strength of composite sandwich structures after barely visible impact damage, Journal of Composites Technology and Research, 18, 4, pp. 274-284, (1996); Kassapoǵlou, Christos, COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF COMPOSITE SANDWICH PANELS AFTER IMPACT DAMAGE: AN EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL STUDY., Journal of Composites Technology and Research, 10, 2, pp. 65-73, (1988)",""

The present paper aims to develop a design methodology for the improvement of crashworthiness behaviour of the fuselage. The first step, a simplified fuselage model, was suggested by introducing a hexagonal honeycomb energy absorption device into the sub-floor structure without sacrificing the volume of cargo. Next, drop tests for a small-scale fuselage model, both original and newly suggested ones, were carried out to examine the developed design methodology. It was shown that introducing a honeycomb energy absorption device would significantly decrease the acceleration level acted on the passengers. In addition, non-linear finite element software ABAQUS was used to simulate the drop tests. The numerical results were in good agreement with those of the test results. Also, the energy absorption behaviour of sub-components in the fuselage structure was evaluated and the optimised design for the energy absorption device was discussed based on the numerical predictions. Finally, the finite element model was extended to simulate some other impact conditions such as the change of roll angle. The discussions were also recorded.

Their structural efficiency depends to a great extent on the lightweight core separating the face sheets and providing overall high stiffness. Detailed finite element (FE) modelling of the penetration of honeycombs by a projectile can be occasionally complex and computationally expensive. In this paper, a computationally efficient equivalent numerical model for a hexagonal honeycomb subjected to high-speed impacts is developed in ABAQUS/Explicit, based on an equation-of-state model for porous media. A multi-objective Taguchi optimization is used to identify unknown material parameters in this model. It is shown that with the optimal set of parameters, the equivalent model can closely predict perforation velocities, particularly in the higher ranges, for different impact conditions, requiring less than 8% of the time needed to run a detailed FE model of the same honeycomb configuration.","Computational efficiency; High-speed impact; Honeycomb; Model identification; Taguchi optimization","Computational efficiency; Efficiency; Equations of state; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical models; Porous materials; Stiffness; Taguchi methods; Computationally efficient; High specific strength; High speed impact; Honeycomb; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Model identification; Structural efficiencies; Taguchi optimizations; Honeycomb structures","Goldsmith, Werner, Axial perforation of aluminum honeycombs by projectiles, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 32, 8-9, pp. 1017-1046, (1995); Hoo Fatt, Michelle S., Perforation of honeycomb sandwich plates by projectiles, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 31, 8, pp. 889-899, (2000); High Velocity Impact Dynamics, (1990); Wu, Enboa, Axial crush of metallic honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 19, 5-6, pp. 439-456, (1997); Goldsmith, Werner, Perforation of cellular sandwich plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 19, 5-6, pp. 361-379, (1997); Zhao, Han, Crushing behaviour of aluminium honeycombs under impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 21, 10, pp. 827-836, (1998); Okumura, Dai, Post-buckling analysis of elastic honeycombs subject to in-plane biaxial compression, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, 13-14, pp. 3487-3503, (2002); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Masters, I.

Indeed, hollow-sphere structures could represent an alternative solution to classical cellular materials (like metal foams or honeycombs) for numerous structural applications like impact resistance for example. The aim of this work is to understand how the architecture of such materials governs their overall mechanical behaviour through modelling. In this work, emphasis is put on the influence of the localized plasticity and the buckling of spheres on the stacking's effective behaviour. A finite-element model is used, taking into account these mechanisms, in order to characterize how the stiffness, of both the meniscuses and the hollow spheres respectively, contributes to the effective stiffness of the stacking. The role of the stacking arrangement on its effective behaviour is studied.

The deformation processes of the models were disturbed by inclusions; shear bands were pinned, and the cell regions surrounded by inclusions were shielded. Mean stress, densification strain, and absorbed energy per unit volume normalized by the values of the model without inclusions were found to be only dependent on the fraction of inclusions. As the volume fraction of inclusions increased, the normalized mean stress linearly increased and the normalized densification strain linearly decreased. The normalized absorbed energy per unit volume could be approximated by an inverted parabolic equation. The energy absorption of models with inclusions having volume fractions from 0 to 0.25 was larger than that of the models without inclusions. In particular, honeycomb models with fractions of inclusion from 0.1 to 0.2 exhibited the maximum absorbed energy. The model with a volume fraction larger than 0.4 could not be compressed because the inclusions in the model had already percolated before deformation. The in-plane impact behavior of honeycomb structures as energy absorbing materials can be designed by using the approximate equation and selecting the volume fraction of inclusions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Densification strain increases as crushing velocity increases and asymptotes to a limit once a shock front forms. It has also been shown that the one-dimensional shock theory [Reid SR, Peng C.

Firstly, under the assumption that the edge length and thickness are the same, the dynamic properties of the honeycombs filled by cells with different shapes (equilateral triangular or quadratic cells) and micro-arrangements (regular or staggered arrangement) are numerically analyzed. The full-scale in-plane dynamic crushing of the specimen, as well as the micro-structure transformation during the deformation, is discussed. Based on these, the influence of the cell micro-arrangement on the energy absorption ability of the honeycombs is clarified. The results show that owing to the differences in the micro-topology, triangular or quadratic honeycombs display different local deformation properties during the crushing. The variation of the cell arrangement patterns changes the local dynamic evolution characteristic of stress waves. '>' and '<' mode local deformation bands form at the sides of the stagger-arranged honeycombs, which results in lateral compression shrinkage during the crushing. The plateau stresses also increase with the impact velocity by a square law. The empirical equations for honeycombs filled with different cells (equilateral triangular or quadratic cells) and micro-arrangements (regular or staggered arrangement) at high impact velocities are formulated in terms of impact velocity, and the cell geometrical (edge length and thickness) and topology (edge connectivity) parameters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments were performed using a short cylindrical projectile with either a flat or hemispherical nose that struck the target plate at an angle of obliquity. A total of 170 tests were performed at angles of obliquity 0-45°. The results suggest that during perforation by a flat-nosed projectile, layered plates cause more energy loss than monolithic plates of the same material and total thickness. There was no significant difference in the measured ballistic limit speed between monolithic plates and layered plates during oblique impact perforation by a hemispherical-nosed projectile. To develop understanding of the process of fracture development and perforation of a thin stainless-steel sheet resulting from oblique impact by a hard, flat-nosed projectile, numerical simulations by ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code were compared against the experimental fracture patterns, residual velocities and ballistic limits of perforated plates. Effects of projectile length-to-diameter ratio and spacing between layered plates struck by flat-nosed projectiles were investigated. For projectiles of equal mass, a longer projectile (larger ratio of length to diameter, L/D>2) results in a drastic decrease in the ballistic limit speed for a double-layered plate. For thin, layered plates, the ballistic limit speed is affected significantly by the spacing between layers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The core of the sandwich is made of a Nomex Honeycomb core and the faces are laminated and remain thin. The mechanism of failure of this kind of structure under post-impact compressive loading is due to interaction between three mechanical behaviors: geometrical nonlinearity due to the skin's neutral line off-set in the dent area, nonlinear response of the core and damages to the skins. For the type of sandwich analysed in this study, initially the core crushes at the apex of the damage. Using a finite element discrete modelling of the core previously proposed by the authors, the load corresponding to the crushing of the first cell can be computed and it gives the value of the residual strength for our criterion. Some geometric and material hypotheses are assumed in the damaged area mainly based on non-destructive inspection (NDI). The criterion is then applied to tests modelled by Lacy and Hwang [Lacy TE, Hwang Y. Numerical modelling of impact-damaged sandwich composites subjected to compression after impact loading. Compos Struct 2003;61:115-128]. It is shown that the criterion allows a good prediction of the tests except in the case of very small dents. Several sensitivity studies on the assumptions were made and it is shown that using this approach, the criterion is robust. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative results were obtained based on the measurement in the tests by a ballistic pendulum with corresponding sensors, and then the deformation/failure modes of specimen were classified and analysed systematically.

Certain computation tools exist at present but they are very time-consuming and they also fail to perfectly model the physical phenomena involved in an impact. In a previous publication, the authors demonstrated the possibility of representing the Nomex™ honeycomb core by a grid of nonlinear springs and have pointed out both the structural behaviour of the honeycomb and the influence of core-skin boundary conditions. This discrete approach accurately predicts the static indentation on honeycomb core alone and the indentation on sandwich structure with metal skins supported on rigid flat support. In this study, the domain of validity of this approach is investigated. It is found that the approach is not valid for sharp projectiles on thin skins. In any case, the spring elements used to model the honeycomb cannot take into account the transverse shear that occurs in the core during the bending of a sandwich. To overcome this strong limitation, a multi-level approach is proposed in the present article. In this approach, the sandwich structure is modelled by Mindlin plate elements and the computed static contact law is implemented in a nonlinear spring located between the impactor and the structure. Thus, it is possible to predict the dynamic structural response in the case of low-velocity/low-energy impact on metal-skinned sandwich structures. A good correlation with dynamic experimental tests is achieved. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For this new concept metal sheets are used at the outer surfaces to maximize rigidity while introducing in between lightweight cores adhesively bonded to keep the whole structure together. Furthermore, composite or wood layers may be used as intermediate layers to improve impact resistance. Potential methods for the manufacturing of this new structure are based on compression under vacuum.

While sandwich structures are very weight efficient and provide integrated acoustic and thermal insulation, impact damage can provoke a significant strength and stability reduction. Therefore, the objective of CODAC is to provide methodologies which reliably simulate impact events and predict impact damage sizes. Since frequent design loops require a quick analysis, efficient deformation and failure models are desired. To achieve a rapid and accurate stress analysis, a recently developed three-layered finite shell element is applied. Failure analysis is based on a progressive damage mechanics approach: Damage initiation is detected by stress-based failure criteria. Material resistance is reduced by appropriate, step-wise linear degradation models. An experimental impact test program on honeycomb sandwich panels is used to validate the impact simulation of the FE-tool CODAC. Comparisons between impact tests and simulations showed that CODAC is capable of accurately and rapidly simulating impact events, which induce barely visible damage. Furthermore, the onset of clearly visible damage is correctly predicted. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In terms of finding more efficient and lighter crash absorber in this research, two steps have been done:. First, multidesign optimization (MDO) technique has been applied to maximize the energy absorption and specific energy absorption of square, rectangular and circular tubes. Results of MDO have shown that the circular tubes have the best response. Results of previous works have indicated that filling of tubes with light filler often improve the crashworthiness behavior, and when the density of filler is higher than critical filler density the structure will lose its weight efficiency. Therefore, selection of an appropriate honeycomb density and tube thickness is unavoidable.

Square-honeycomb specimens of relative density 0.10 were manufactured using a slotting technique, and the stresses on the front and back faces of the dynamically compressed square honeycombs were measured using a direct impact Kolsky bar. Three-dimensional finite element simulations of the experiments were performed to model the response and to help interpret the experimental results. The study has identified three distinct factors governing the dynamic response of the square honeycombs: material rate sensitivity, inertial stabilization of the webs against buckling, and plastic wave propagation. Material rate sensitivity and inertial stabilization of the webs against buckling cause the front and back face stresses to increase by about a factor of two over their quasi-static value when the impact speed is increased from 0 to 50 ms-1. At higher impact velocities, plastic wave effects cause the front face stress to increase linearly with velocity whereas the back face stress is almost independent of velocity. The finite element predictions are in rea-sonable agreement with the measurements.

Recent applications have demonstrated that FRP honeycomb sandwich panels can be effectively and economically applied for both new construction and rehabilitation and replacement of existing structures. This paper is concerned with impact analysis of an as-manufactured FRP honeycomb sandwich system with sinusoidal core geometry in the plane and extending vertically between face laminates. The analyses of the honeycomb structure and components including: (1) constituent materials and ply properties, (2) face laminates and core wall engineering properties, and (3) equivalent core material properties, are first introduced, and these properties for the face laminates and equivalent core are later used in dynamic analysis of sandwich beams. A higher-order impact sandwich beam theory by the authors [Yang MJ, Qiao P. Higher-order impact modeling of sandwich beams with flexible core. Int J Solids Struct 2005;42(20):5460-90] is adopted to carry out the free vibration and impact analyses of the FRP honeycomb sandwich system, from which the full elastic field (e.g., deformation and stress) under impact is predicted. The higher order vibration analysis of the FRP sandwich beams is conducted, and its accuracy is validated with the finite element Eigenvalue analysis using ABAQUS; while the predicted impact responses (e.g., contact force and central deflection) are compared with the finite element simulations by LS-DYNA. A parametric study with respect to projectile mass and velocity is performed, and the similar prediction trends with the linear solution are observed. Furthermore, the predicted stress fields are compared with the available strength data to predict the impact damage in the FRP sandwich system. The present impact analysis demonstrates the accuracy and capability of the higher order impact sandwich beam theory, and it can be used effectively in analysis, design applications and optimization of efficient FRP honeycomb composite sandwich structures for impact protection and mitigation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

FE models are constructed for such honeycomb structures based on Voronoi diagrams with different degrees of cell shape irregularity and cell wall thickness non-uniformity. The plateau stress, the densification strain energy and the initiation strain are determined using the FE models. Simulation results reveal that the ""X"" and ""V"" shaped deformation modes evident in a perfectly ordered honeycomb at low or moderate impact velocities are disrupted as cell shapes become irregular and/or cell wall thickness gets non-uniform. The ""I"" shaped deformation mode is clearly seen in all honeycomb structures at high impact velocities. Both the plateau stress and the densification strain energy are found to decrease as the degree of cell shape irregularity or the degree of cell wall thickness non-uniformity increases, with the weakening effect induced by the presence of non-uniform cell wall thickness being more significant. When the two types of imperfections co-exist in a honeycomb structure, the interaction between them is seen to exhibit a complicated pattern and to have a nonlinear effect on both the plateau stress and the densification strain energy. It is also found that stress waves propagate faster in a honeycomb structure having irregular cell shapes and slower in a honeycomb structure having non-uniform cell wall thickness than in a perfectly ordered honeycomb. Finally, the strain hardening of the cell wall material is seen to have a strengthening effect on the plateau stress, which is more significant for perfectly ordered honeycombs than for imperfect honeycomb structures. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this research is to understand and, ultimately, predict the initiation and progression of damage in an aluminium sandwich plate subjected to low-velocity impact. The static indentation and impact problems were analysed using the commercial finite-element software, ABAQUS. Quasi-static indentation tests and low-velocity drop weight tests were conducted to characterize the failure and to determine the extent of damage observed in aluminium sandwich plates. Comparison of the numerical load history, specimen damage area, and residual indentation with experimental results demonstrated the ability of the modelling methodology to capture the impact characteristics. Experimental results also indicated that the damage mode experienced on the impacted facesheet may be correlated to the energy absorbed by the plate during the impact event and the static failure energy. A numerical parametric study was conducted to determine the effect of various geometric parameters, such as foil thickness and cell size, on the damage resistance of the core and impacted facesheet. Findings showed that the energy absorbed during impact is independent of the core density. However, denser cores exhibited greater peak loads but experienced smaller damage profiles in the core and impacted facesheet. © IMechE 2006.","Aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures; Explicit finite-element analysis; Impact damage","Damage resistance; Low velocity impact; Quasi static loading; Sandwich panels; Aluminum; Computer software; Failure analysis; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Numerical methods; Sandwich structures; Structural panels","Behavior of Sandwich Structures of Isotropic and Composite Materials, (1999); Impact on Composite Structures, (1998); Finite Element Analysis of Impact Damaged Honeycomb Sandwich, (1998); Wierzbicki, Tomasz, Crushing analysis of metal honeycombs, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 1, 2, pp. 157-174, (1983); Côté, François, The out-of-plane compressive behavior of metallic honeycombs, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 380, 1-2, pp. 272-280, (2004); Yamashita, Minoru, Impact behavior of honeycomb structures with various cell specifications - Numerical simulation and experiment, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 32, 1-4, pp. 618-630, (2005); Kee Paik, Jeom, Strength characteristics of aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 35, 3, pp. 205-231, (1999); Herup, Eric J., Low-velocity impact damage initiation in graphite/epoxy/Nomex honeycomb-sandwich plates, Composites Science and Technology, 57, 12, pp. 1581-1598, (1998); Wen, H.

The IIHS offset deformable barrier (ODB), designed to mimic an average collision partner during an accident, is however a relatively expensive and time-consuming representation for evaluating the safety of a given vehicle during frontal collisions. The repeatability of tests based on ODBs has also been questioned in some investigations reported in published literature. In the current paper, available finite element models of a compact car (Dodge Neon) and a full-size car (Dodge Intrepid) were first improved and validated against actual test results reported by the IIHS. Each of these validated models was next subjected to 40% offset impact against a rigid wall in lieu of the deformable IIHS barrier at a lower speed calculated on the basis of energy balance.

It was shown that a remarkably good correlation can be obtained for occupant compartment intrusions for impact against an offset rigid barrier vis-à-vis the IIHS ODB.

The main results of this paper will be presented in two parts. The first part addresses: • Development of specific experimental methods to monitor post-buckling delamination behaviour. • Validation of mixed mode propagation criteria and development of experimental protocol to determine material fracture mechanics parameters. • A robust numerical F.E. computation scheme (modified virtual crack extension) to assess energy released rate and mode partition along the delamination tip. Illustrations of the method will be presented through two typical configurations: • Local delamination near the surface in a monolithic composite. • Debonding between skin and honeycomb core of a sandwich structures. The second part will detail extension of the methodology proposed previously to assess failure mechanisms during static compression after impact of a monolithic composite plate. The damage morphology of an impacted composite plate is characterised by multi-delaminations with a typical helix geometry. The ruin mechanism is regarded as an elastic non-linear behaviour in the damaged area due to a progressive local buckling of delaminated plies until a coupled bending-compression failure. Damage evolution is predicted by introduction of delaminations in a 3D F.E. model with non-penetration contact conditions and elastic properties degradation of the damaged plies. Techniques to manage a mesh with multi-delaminations will be detailed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The major damage modes due to the impact, including the residual indentation on the impacted facesheet, the initially crushed core under the impacted area, and the delamination are incorporated into the model. A consequential core crushing mechanism is incorporated into the analysis by using an element deactivation technique. Damage propagation behavior, which corresponds to those observed in sandwich compression after impact (SCAI) tests, has been successfully captured in the numerical simulation. The critical far field stress corresponding to the onset of damage propagation at specified critical locations near the damage zone are captured successfully. They show a good correlation with experimental data.

The elemental beam theory has been adopted for each component inside the 'unit-cell' to arrive at the different expressions for effective properties utilizing the strain energy concept. The length of the diagonal struts, vertical struts, and included angle, as well as the thickness of the struts have been kept as variable, so various forms of hexagonal honeycomb cellular structures can be investigated in this approach. Other conventional finite element approaches and numerical homogenization methods are rather time consuming to predict effective properties. Moreover, a change in basic cell configuration (i.e., depth) requires a complete new meshing and analysis. In comparison, the analytical approach presented here is simple and computes the effective properties in a fraction of the time that is required for FE analysis with a minimum change in the input file. The proper implementation of this method embedded in large quasi-static or impact dynamic simulations (where part of the structure could be modeled with detailed finite element mesh for cellular core that may initiate damage, and rest could be modeled with a single solid layer of equivalent material properties) would give high computational advantage, which is essential in large-scale aerospace modeling and simulation environment. © 2006 SAGE Publication.","Cellular structure; Effective properties; Hexagonal; Honeycomb; Unit-cell","Aerospace industry; Computer simulation; Elasticity; Final control devices; Strain; Effective properties; Hexagonal; Honeycomb; Unit-cell; Honeycomb structures","Kelsey, S., The Shear Modulus of Foil Honeycomb Cores: A Theoretical and Experimental Investigation on Cores Used in Sandwich Construction, Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, 30, 10, pp. 294-302, (1958); Penzien, Joseph, Effective shear modulus of honeycomb cellular structure, AIAA Journal, 2, 3, pp. 531-535, (1964); Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Warren, William E., Foam mechanics: the linear elastic response of two-dimensional spatiallly periodic cellular materials, Mechanics of Materials, 6, 1, pp. 27-37, (1987); Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Chamis, Christos C., Fiber composite sandwich thermostructural behavior: computational simulation, Journal of Composites Technology and Research, 10, 3, pp. 93-99, (1988); Mechanics of Materials, (1997); Grédiac, Michel M., A finite element study of the transverse shear in honeycomb cores, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 30, 13, pp. 1777-1788, (1993); An Introduction to Sandwich Construction, (1995); Shi, Guangyu, The derivation of equivalent constitutive equations of honeycomb structures by a two scale method, Computational Mechanics, 15, 5, pp. 395-407, (1995)",""

The resistance to shock loading is quantified by the permanent transverse deflection at mid-span of the plates as a function of projectile momentum. It is found that the sandwich plates have a higher shock resistance than monolithic plates of equal mass, and the square-honeycomb sandwich plates outperform the pyramidal core plates. Three-dimensional finite element simulations of the experiments are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The finite element calculations indicate that the ratio of loading time to structural response time is approximately 0.5.

The experiments have been designed to achieve two objectives: (i) to demonstrate the benefits of sandwich construction, and (ii) to assess the fidelity of dynamic finite element calculations in simulating the structural response. The results affirm that, when subjected to impulse levels representative of those associated with nearby explosions, the sandwich beams exhibit smaller displacements than the solid beams at equivalent weight. The benefit is especially large at lower impulses where the effective dynamic strength of the honeycomb core prevents crushing. The measurements and finite element simulations having greatest relevance to the shock resistance are found to correspond closely, particularly the displacements and the core crushing strains.

The influences of cell irregularity and impact velocity on the deformation mode and the plateau crush pressure are investigated. Two irregularity-generating methods are used. One is the disorder of nodal locations of a regular hexagonal honeycomb and the other is based on the 2D random Voronoi technique. The results show that the deformation in an irregular honeycomb is more complicated than that in a regular honeycomb due to its cell irregularity. At a low impact velocity, a Quasi-static mode with multiple random shear bands appears, while at a higher impact velocity, a Transitional mode is found, i.e., a mode with localized random shear bands and layerwise collapse bands. Finally, at a much higher impact velocity, a Dynamic mode appears with a narrow localized layerwise collapse band near the crushed end. The velocities for transition between modes are evaluated and expressed by empirical equations. Deformation anisotropy is found in the response of disordered honeycombs but it vanishes with the increase in the irregularity. Statistical results show that the relative energy absorption capacity of cellular materials can be improved by increasing their cell irregularity. This effect is obvious especially at an impact velocity near the mode transition velocity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Two-layer panels with polymer matrix composite laminated face sheets and a thin internal sheet subjected to low velocity impact are studied in this paper. The commercial LS-DYNA3D software is used to model and analyze the dynamic problem, and attention is focused on the local displacement of a honeycomb core under the point of impact in the conditions of various locations of the internal sheet and of different levels of impact energy. Simulated results reveal that the local displacement of the core along the direction of the impact has been decreased significantly by introducing the internal sheet into a traditional single sandwich structure and by reducing the space between the internal sheet and the impacted face sheet.

The test panels are representative of the composite sandwich structure of the engine nacelle Fan Cowl Doors of a large commercial aircraft. The low-velocity impact response of the composites sandwich panels is studied at five energy levels, ranging from 5 to 20 J, with the intention of investigating damage initiation, damage propagation, and failure mechanisms. These impact energy levels are typically causing barely visible impact damage (BVID) in the impacted composite facesheet. A numerical simulation was performed using LS-DYNA3D transient dynamic finite element analysis code for calculating contact forces during impact along with a failure analysis for predicting the threshold of impact damage and initiation of delaminations. Good agreement was obtained between numerical and experimental results. In particular, the numerical simulation was able to predict the extent of impact damage and impact energy absorbed by the structure. The results of this study is proving that a correct numerical model can yield significant information for the designer to understand the mechanism involved in the low-velocity impact event, prior to conducting tests, and therefore to design a more efficient impact-resistant aircraft structure. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A hand-held wooden bar and a hand-thrown concrete half-brick were selected as impacting objects for the multi-impact simulations. For simulation procedures the primary geometry was created by in-house software. For easy comparison of the shape effect and the damage effect of both impacting objects, all multi-impact simulations were based on the same impact speed at 5 m/s. The total strain energy absorbed by a deformed honeycomb structure reflects the degree of damage due to the dynamic impact of a hand thrown missile.","","composite; durability; honeycomb construction; impact resistance","",""

A comprehensive study of the mechanisms, by which these two types of cells undergo large deformation under impact loading, will help to deepen our understanding of the dynamic behavior of cellular materials. In this paper, special attention is paid to the dynamic response of a chain of type II cells under a projectile impact. Both the FE analysis and the equivalent mass-spring model proposed in part I of the paper are employed, and the results agree well with each other while the mass-spring model is much more efficient than the FE simulation. Three collapse modes of type II chain are identified, depending on the initial impact velocity. Furthermore, based on the equivalent mass-spring model, the local contact behavior between the striker and the first cell of the type II chain, and the effects of the associated parameters (e.g., the effects of cell number, cell wall inertia, mass ratio, input energy, etc.) are discussed in detail. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

From the viewpoint of energy transfer, this analysis explains why the collapse could not stop by itself once began. By introducing a design parameter called collapse stability index that controls design against progressive collapse, it is found that conventional design of a tall building usually leads to an inherently unstable structure in the event of a progressive collapse. In a subsequent feasibility study in this paper, a heavy-duty metal-based honeycomb energy absorbing structure is proposed. Using a finite element analysis, it is demonstrated that the structure is capable of absorbing potential energy released in a tall building collapse. The added energy absorbing devices will only occupy a small percentage of the total floor space. By properly designing and installing such devices, a progressive collapse, should it happen in a tall building, may be arrested within a few floors, and hence, the building is inherently stable to the progressive collapse. The theory is also elaborated with the example of the World Trade Center collapse. © ASCE.","Buildings; Collapse; Energy absorption; Failures; High-rise; Honeycomb structures; Impact loads","Architectural design; Civil engineering; Energy transfer; Finite element method; Mathematical models; Structural analysis; Design parameters; World Trade Center; Mechanics; Energy dissipation; explosion","Bažant, Zdeněk Z., Shear buckling of sandwich, fiber composite and lattice columns, bearings, and helical springs: Paradox resolved, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 70, 1, pp. 75-83, (2003); Bažant, Zdeněk Z., Why did world trade center collapse? - Simple analysis, Archive of Applied Mechanics, 71, 12, pp. 802-806, (2001); Bažant, Zdeněk Z., Why did the world trade center collapse?-Simple analysis, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 128, 1, pp. 2-6, (2002); Eagar, Thomas W., Why did the World Trade Center collapse?

Herein, aiming at the vibration mitigation for a specific high-tech industrial area, the low-frequency vibrations from a train viaduct are targeted over an anticipated range. A theoretically designed innovative countermeasure, called honeycomb wave impeding barrier (WIB) for a wave impeding barrier, is introduced and its effects are investigated by computer simulation. The present WIB is based on the wave dispersion phenomenon that can modulate the incoming wavelengths into the shorter wavelengths, creating an apparent wave cut-off characteristic in the wave field across WIB installation area. The shorter wavelengths are further impeded due to the impedance ratio of the WIB walls and in-fill materials and absorbed by the in-fills more. The three-dimensional FEM simulation demonstrates a dramatic reduction effect that is difficult to achieve by conventional measures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The other panels with their thin skins and thick core were found to penetrate easily whereupon the impactor forced the back-face to debond massively. These panels then had the worst CAI strength.Both the impact damage and the CAI behaviour-to failure-were simulated using a finite element model of skins and core. The model gave very respectable agreements with the impact tests even though the damage in skin and core were extremely complex mechanisms, involving progressive fibre fracture in the skin and elasto-plastic deformation in compression and shear in the honeycomb core.

Deformation modes in the X<inf>1</inf> direction change significantly with different values of cell wall thickness and impact velocity. Three deformation modes are observed. They are summarised in a mode classification map and two empirical formulae are obtained for critical velocities at which deformation mode changes. Two deformation modes are observed in the X<inf>2</inf> direction. The plateau stresses are related to the cell wall thickness by a power law for a given velocity and they are proportional to the square of velocity for a high velocity. An empirical formula for plateau stress at high impact velocities is derived in terms of the cell wall thickness and velocity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The response of the honeycomb with the smaller slenderness ratio was studied for impact speeds up to 40.0 m/s which corresponds to a nominal strain rate for the specimen of 500 s-1. Total plastically dissipated energy was used to quantify the effects of increasing strain-rate, since other measures showed a strong dependence on details of the finite element model. The simulations revealed a strong increase of total dissipated energy with increasing impact speed for velocities larger than the critical speed for wave trapping, v<inf>cr</inf>. One reason was a higher percent of cells collapsing in a symmetric crush mode (IV). Another reason for the larger total dissipation at higher crushing speeds was the greater irregularity in the folding pattern that developed. Experimental and calculated global force-time curves were compared for the honeycomb with the larger slenderness ratio at impact speeds 3.0 and 7.2 m/s and a satisfactory agreement was found. At these low impact speeds there was no increase of initial collapse or plateau stresses.

The honeycomb structures were loaded in compression at the top surface with a prescribed velocity. Two different boundary conditions were considered; these produced an approximation to a state of uniaxial stress or uniaxial strain at an early state of deformation. The simulations proved that elastic wave propagation had an important effect on crush band initiation, since loading and unloading parts of the compressive wave can reinforce or delay crushing, respectively. Stress enhancement with increasing impact speed is mainly due to translational micro-inertia and not due to micro-rotational inertia. This effect is stronger for uniaxial strain than for uniaxial stress. For the specific case examined here, stress enhancement begins for uniaxial strain at an impact speed of about 1.0 m/s whereas for uniaxial stress it begins at about 10.0 m/s. For the analysed honeycomb the simulation showed for both boundary conditions the existence of a critical impact velocity, so that for impact speeds larger than this critical speed a crush band initiated at the impact surface. For much smaller speeds the location of the initial crush band was determined by the distribution and extent of initial imperfections. In the case of uniaxial stress an analytical estimate of the critical impact speed was derived using the theory of wave trapping. The critical speed depends only on the ratio of the length of the ribbon wall to the length of the thinner inclined wall and the material properties of the constituent material. For the aluminium honeycomb investigated in this paper, wave trapping is predicted to occur for impact speeds greater than 7.6 m/s which is close to the critical speed calculated with the finite element simulations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The main drawback of sandwich components is their relatively low resistance to impact damage and the extent to which their strength is reduced under compressive loading after impact. As part of a wider study aimed at increasing the impact resistance of sandwich panels, a continuum damage model is proposed. The model developed describes the compressive behaviour of honeycombs made from materials that are prone to elastic buckling. The material behaviour in compression is described by a combination of three distinct constitutive models, namely elastic, elastic continuum damage and an inelastic strain accumulation model.

This mechanism is intended to minimize occupant injuries by providing reduced resistance to the impacting vehicles. The slip-base mechanism could be sensitive to many design parameters. Conventional design and evaluation of safety performance of these systems by trial and error and crash testing is inefficient, as well as cost prohibitive. Therefore, finite-element (FE) models that can accurately simulate the performance of the slip-base system in various crash scenarios are of essential value. This paper describes dynamic FE models of a slip-base sign support system and its crash performance with vehicles using DYNA3D code. The geometric features, as well as several physical phenomena of components of the slip-base mechanism, e.g., sliding friction, clamping forces, bolt-plate interactions, and plate rupture, are modeled and verified in simulation. The FE modeling methods for the required features are described in detail. A validated model of Bogie and its honeycomb material is used as the impacting vehicle. FE crash simulations of Bogie with flexible honeycomb nose impacting the slip-base sign support are validated using the corresponding instrumented crash tests. The simulation model reveals the correct behavior of the break away system response upon impact. The slipping mechanism and Bogie acceleration and velocity responses are accurate as compared with actual crash test results. The FE approach and this validated model can be exercised in numerous crash scenarios for design optimization of other variations of slip-base systems in size, orientation, etc., or for performance evaluation of impacts with various vehicles.","","Accident prevention; Computer simulation; Finite element method; Highway accidents; Impact testing; Optimization; Structural design; Supports; Crash testing; Slip base mechanism; Software package DYNA3D; Traffic signs","Rep no Fhwa Rd 88 213, (1988); Benson, David J., APPLICATION OF DYNA3D TO LARGE SCALE CRASHWORTHINESS CALCULATIONS., 1, pp. 311-317, (1986); Benson, David J., DYNA3D, INGRID, AND TAURUS - AN INTEGRATED, INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE SYSTEM FOR CRASHWORTHINESS ENGINEERING., 3, pp. 247-254, (1985); Federal Outdoor Impact Laboratory Test Numbers 950007 950009 Fhwa Contract no Dtfh61 91 Z 00002, (1995); Finite Element Model of A Small Automobile Impacting A Rigid Pole, (1994); Proc 29th Int Symp on Automotive Technol and Automation Sata Road and Vehicle Safety, (1996); Eskandarian, Azim, Finite element model and validation of a surrogate crash test vehicle for impacts with roadside objects, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 2, 3, pp. 239-258, (1997); Cray Channels, (1992); Rep Under Federal Highway Administration Contract no Dtfh61 89 C 00100, (1990); Finite Element News, (1988)",""

A series of quasi-static transverse indentation tests of composite sandwich plates are carried out to study the contact law of honeycomb core sandwich composites. An analysis program of the transient dynamic finite element analysis was developed to calculate the impact characteristics of the impactor and the composite sandwich plate, and to predict the damage to the composite sandwich plate during the low velocity impacts process. For estimating the occurrence and the extension of the damage to the composite sandwich plate subjected impact, an impact damage model of the honeycomb core composite sandwich plates was set up and applied in the program. This model consisted of the damage occurring criterion and the damage extension criterion. A simplified criterion of the damage to honeycomb core was proposed in this paper. The results of numerical calculation showed that the impact energy had significant effect on the impact contact face and the damage process of sandwich plates, and the impact characteristics of composite sandwich plate were different from laminated composite plate. Finally, a series of standard low velocity tests on honeycomb core composite sandwich plates were carried out to demonstrate the analysis results. The comparison between both showed that the predictions agree with the test data fairly well.","","Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Mathematical models; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Damage analysis; Damage extension criteria; Damage occurring criteria; Plates (structural components)","Choi, Hyung-yun, A Model for Predicting Damage in Graphite/Epoxy Laminated Composites Resulting from Low-Velocity Point Impact, Journal of Composite Materials, 26, 14, pp. 2134-2169, (1992); J Reine Angew Math, (1881); Yang, S.

Three different problems that focus on the effect of differences in honeycomb material properties on static and dynamic response are presented and discussed. The first problem considered is a linear elastic static analysis of honeycomb sandwich beams. The second is a nonlinear elastic-plastic analysis of a circular honeycomb sandwich plate. The final problem is a dynamic analysis of circular honeycomb sandwich plates impacted by low velocity projectiles. Results are obtained using the ABAQUS final element code and compared against experimental results.

US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) uses a surrogate reusable test vehicle, Bogie, to conduct crash tests of roadside safety features. Bogie is intended to replace an impacting vehicle in order to reduce the cost of the test. Bogie can be configured with different crushable impact noses representing various vehicle fronts. Typically, the crushable nose employed by Bogie is a multi-compartment honeycomb material. Different configurations of honeycomb arrangement are considered for different impact velocities. Recently, the advances in crashworthiness and dynamic finite element analysis have allowed considerable modelling and simulation of vehicle impacts with roadside hardware. This paper describes, in detail, the finite element models and the validation of Bogie and its honeycomb material in impacts with an instrumented rigid pole. This model can be exercised in various simulations of crash scenarios for design optimization of roadside hardware.

In experiment, the impact velocity is ranged from 1.98 to 10m/s. As for 3/8in. honeycomb, irregular folding pattern appears just to a little extent in experiment. On the other hand, very irregular buckling pattern is observed in 3/4in. honeycomb. Crush strength becomes slightly larger as the impact velocity increases. The maximum value of acceleration measured by an acceleration sensor attached to the drop-hammer seems to be almost constant when the impact velocity is greater than a certain value, and increases rapidly as the foil thickness increases. Furthermore, numerical simulation is carried out by using the dynamic explicit nonlinear finite element code DYNA3D. In the computation, due to the geometrical symmetry of hexagonal honeycomb core, the 'Y' letter model is proposed.

Key properties include high specific stiffness and specific strength, ease of fabrication, and the ability to tailor impact resistance. The engine and gearbox, which in current designs are placed at the rear of the car, are load-bearing components and must be attached to the sandwich body shell. Although techniques for introducing loads into the skins of sandwich panels, via inserts, are well established, for Grand Prix cars, where every gram of weight must be saved, efficiency is at a premium. Thus the shape of the insert is critical and the choice of the bonding adhesive and insert's material important. While it is possible to undertake preliminary design using simple methods, if a complex insert geometry is used, recourse to finite element (FE) analysis is inevitable. However, particular difficulties arise when using FE methods in these circumstances, notably the relatively small thickness of the panel skins and the discontinuity at the insert boundary. In the current paper these issues are addressed for a particular application. To assess the efficiency of load transfer, three different insert geometries are considered. The influence of element type, mesh size and boundary conditions are addressed and their influence on stress levels and discontinuities assessed. Ways of representing the honeycomb core are also considered, as is the need to involve non-linear effects, such as the shear stress-strain properties of the adhesive. The FE results are compared with experimental data obtained from testing a representative panel to which a photoelastic coating had been applied. Encouraging agreement between prediction and experiment was obtained, together with guidance as to the optimum insert shape. © 1995.","finite element analysis; insert geometries; strain distributions","Adhesives; Composite materials; Fabrication; Finite element method; Honeycomb structures; Impact resistance; Racing automobiles; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Strain; Strength of materials; Structural panels; Insert geometry; Load transfer; Strain distribution; Automobile parts and equipment","Msc Dissertation, (1994); Introduction to the Finite Element Method, (1972); Finite Element Analysis Theory and Practice, (1992); A Finite Element Primer, (1991); Finite Element Method, (2000); Phd Thesis, (1991); Composite Materials Engineering and Science, (1994); Joining Fibre Reinforced Plastics, (1987); Experimental Stress Analysis, (1991)",""
