In contrast, re-entrant honeycomb structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) offer excellent impact resistance and energy absorption capabilities. In this study, a novel SA-grade F-shaped composite crashworthy guardrail was proposed by embedding a re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb structure as an energy-absorbing layer to enhance crash energy dissipation. The accuracy of the finite element (FE) model for the proposed guardrail was validated through quasi-static compression tests on 3D-printed honeycomb specimens, showing good agreement with the simulation results. The applicability of the vehicle FE models was confirmed in accordance with relevant safety standards. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to optimize the honeycomb structure configuration, including geometric design, material selection, and cell wall thickness. A comprehensive crashworthiness evaluation was then performed under various vehicle–guardrail collision scenarios following the specification requirements. The results demonstrate that, compared to the F-shaped guardrail, the proposed design reduces the peak impact forces by 15.1%, 25.2%, and 26.7% for passenger car, bus, and truck, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in cushioning performance. This design concept provides practical insights into the application of auxetic honeycomb structures in the development of advanced guardrail systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Auxetic honeycomb; Composite structure; Crashworthy guardrail; Finite element simulation","Accidents; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Guard rails; Sensitivity analysis; Structural design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Auxetic honeycomb; Auxetics; Composites structures; Crashworthy guardrail; Energy; Finite element modelling (FEM); Finite elements simulation; Hexagonal honeycomb; Composite structures; Honeycomb structures","Sassi, Abdelmonaam, Development of finite element model for the analysis of a guardrail post subjected to dynamic lateral loading, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 19, 5, pp. 457-468, (2014); Whitworth, Horace A., Finite element modeling of the crash performance of roadside barriers, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 9, 1, pp. 35-43, (2004); Atahan, Ali Osman, Impact analysis of a vertical flared back bridge rail-to-guardrail transition structure using simulation, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 41, 4, pp. 371-396, (2005); Atahan, Ali Osman, Computer simulation of recycled content guardrail post impacts, Journal of Transportation Engineering, 130, 6, pp. 733-741, (2004); Atahan, Ali Osman, Finite element simulation of a strong-post W-beam guardrail system, Simulation, 78, 10, pp. 587-599, (2002); Ray, Malcolm H., Finite-element model of modified eccentric loader terminal (MELT), Transportation Research Record, 1599, pp. 11-21, (1997); Consolazio, Gary R., Impact simulation and full scale crash testing of a low profile concrete work zone barrier, Computers and Structures, 81, 13, pp. 1359-1374, (2003); undefined, (2002); Tabiei, Ala, Roadmap for crashworthiness finite element simulation of roadside safety structures, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 34, 2, pp. 145-157, (2000); Yin, Hanfeng, Design optimization of a MASH TL-3 concrete barrier using RBF-based metamodels and nonlinear finite element simulations, Engineering Structures, 114, pp. 122-134, (2016)",""

This study proposes a novel strategy of incorporating shear thickening fluids (STFs) into mortar to develop an innovative impact-resistant material (STFM), exploring the potential of STFs to enhance the impact resistance of construction materials. The mechanical properties and impact resistance of STFM were evaluated using compression, flexural, drop-weight, and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests, while microstructural analyses elucidated the enhancement mechanisms. The results show that the 14-day compressive strength of the mortar is enhanced significantly by adding STF, with an increase up to 43.1 %. Furthermore, the impact strength of STFM is enhanced by 13.1 % and 77.5 % under drop-weight and SHPB impacts, respectively, demonstrating superior energy absorption and structural integrity across varying impact velocities. Different STFs exhibit distinct advantages: STFs with lower critical shear rates are more effective for the modified mortar subjected to a low-velocity impact, whilst STFs with higher critical shear rates offer the best performance at a higher impact velocity. This enhancement in impact resistance is primarily attributed to the energy dissipation capability of STF’s honeycomb-like network structures, the pore-filling effect of nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> particles, and the promotion of hydration product (calcium silicate hydrate gel) formation. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of impact-resistant civil engineering materials and blast-resistant structural components. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.","Impact resistance; Mechanical properties; Microscopic mechanism; Modified mortar; Shear thickening fluid","Blast resistance; Bridge decks; Compressive strength; Drops; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Mechanical testing; Shear flow; AND splits; Critical component; Critical shear rates; Drop weight; Impact loads; Mechanical; Microscopic mechanisms; Modified mortar; Property; Shear-thickening fluids; Hydration; Mortar","Ranade, Ravi, Impact resistance of high strength-high ductility concrete, Cement and Concrete Research, 98, pp. 24-35, (2017); Nourzadeh, Dan, Response of roof beams in buildings subject to blast loading: Analytical treatment, Engineering Structures, 138, pp. 50-62, (2017); Ma, Jialu, Failure modes and failure mechanisms of single-layer reticulated domes subjected to interior blasts, Thin-Walled Structures, 132, pp. 208-216, (2018); Zhao, Weiyi, Experimental study on impact and post-impact behavior of steel-concrete composite panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 130, pp. 405-413, (2018); Ekström, Jonas, Spalling in concrete subjected to shock wave blast, Engineering Structures, 122, pp. 72-82, (2016); Xuan, Weihong, Impact behavior and microstructure of cement mortar incorporating waste carpet fibers after exposure to high temperatures, Journal of Cleaner Production, 187, pp. 222-236, (2018); Olsson, Josefine A., Near-term pathways for decarbonizing global concrete production, Nature Communications, 14, 1, (2023); Shah, Izhar Hussain, Cement substitution with secondary materials can reduce annual global CO2 emissions by up to 1.3 gigatons, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Watari, Takuma, Efficient use of cement and concrete to reduce reliance on supply-side technologies for net-zero emissions, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Siddique, Salman, Strength and impact resistance properties of concrete containing fine bone china ceramic aggregate, Construction and Building Materials, 169, pp. 289-298, (2018)",""

RC walls are vulnerable to low-velocity impact, such as the fall of components caused by earthquakes or explosions, for example, and the impact from road objects, such as vehicles, during their service life. When subjected to instantaneous high-energy impact, RC walls at key positions are prone to severe damage, which can further lead to structural collapse. Therefore, it is necessary to consider improving the impact resistance of key RC walls in a structure. Using a porous honeycomb structure with excellent energy absorption performance to provide impact protection for key RC walls is an effective way to reduce the damage of RC walls and thereby enhance the impact resistance of a structure. Therefore, based on the author’s previous series of experimental and numerical studies on the impact resistance of RC walls, as well as the high-mass pendulum impact experimental study on the honeycomb sandwich panel composite RC wall (HSP-RC wall), this paper adopts a multi-scale modelling method in micro-mechanics and macro-mechanics to establish a pendulum impact finite element model (FEM) for the HSP-RC wall. The representative volume element (RVE) and periodic boundary condition (PBC) are used to calculate the elastic property parameters of the honeycomb, which guide the establishment of the FEMs for the HSP-RC wall. The FEMs can avoid the computational difficulty caused by refined simulation, analyse the impact damage of the HSP-RC walls more accurately, quantify the impact protection effect of the honeycomb sandwich panel, and thus facilitate the parametric analysis of the impact resistance of HSP-RC walls with different honeycomb panel structural parameters in subsequent studies. © 2025 by the authors.","honeycomb sandwich panel; impact; protection effect; RC wall; RVE","Air transportation; Impact resistance; Pendulums; Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural panels; Walls (structural partitions); Air-defence; Building structure; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Impact; Impact protection; Impact resistance performance; Low velocity impact; Protection effect; Reinforced concrete wall; Representative volume elements; Honeycomb structures","Shi, Chenglong, Improving the Impact Resistance and Antisplash of Civil Air Defense Wall: Experiments and Finite-Element Simulation, Journal of Structural Engineering, 149, 2, (2023); Dancygier, Avraham N., Response of high performance concrete plates to impact of non-deforming projectiles, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 34, 11, pp. 1768-1779, (2007); Liu, Jian, Experimental and numerical studies of ultra-high performance concrete targets against high-velocity projectile impacts, Engineering Structures, 173, pp. 166-179, (2018); Sadraie, Hamid R., Dynamic performance of concrete slabs reinforced with steel and GFRP bars under impact loading, Engineering Structures, 191, pp. 62-81, (2019); Karim, Rizwan, Performance of fiber-reinforced concrete link slabs with embedded steel and GFRP rebars, Engineering Structures, 229, (2021); Kuhn, Tino, Behavior of RC-slabs under impact-loading, EPJ Web of Conferences, 94, (2015); Othman, Hesham, An experimental investigation on the effect of steel reinforcement on impact response of reinforced concrete plates, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 88, pp. 12-21, (2016); Yilmaz, T., Experimental Investigation of Impact Behaviour of RC Slab with Different Reinforcement Ratios, KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 24, 1, pp. 241-254, (2020); Radnić, Jure, Impact testing of RC slabs strengthened with CFRP strips, Composite Structures, 121, pp. 90-103, (2015); Guo, Hui, Study on protective performance of impact-resistant polyurea and its coated concrete under impact loading, Construction and Building Materials, 340, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

To further improve the blast resistance of steel-concrete-steel (SCS) composite wall panels, this study introduces two innovative designs incorporating auxetic honeycomb core layers, inspired by the principles of auxetic metamaterials. A comparative analysis of blast resistance was conducted through near-field explosion experiments and numerical simulations, evaluating the performance of the proposed auxetic steel-concrete-steel (NPRSCS) composite panels against conventional SCS panels. The study further examined the effects of critical design parameters, including steel plate thickness and cellular geometric dimensions, on the blast resistance of auxetic panels. Additionally, a predictive formula for the peak mid-span deflection was developed and validated. The findings demonstrate that auxetic SCS composite panels exhibit significantly enhanced deformation resistance and energy absorption capacity. Specifically: Deformation resistance improved by approximately 53.9 % and 49.6 %, respectively, compared to conventional SCS panels. Energy absorption capacity increased by approximately 253.5 % and 29.5 %, respectively. Moreover, the proposed formula accurately predicts the relationship between mid-span deflection and key design parameters, providing a valuable tool for optimizing the design of auxetic SCS composite panels for blast-resistant applications. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers.

This research actively explores this issue. Meanwhile, the dynamic mechanical properties of superfine cement-grouted rock are also listed for comparison. The key findings indicate that both nano-grouted and superfine cement-grouted fractured rocks exhibit an upward trend in dynamic compressive strength with increasing temperature. However, a notable contrast arises: at relatively low temperatures (room temperature and 100°C), nano-grouted specimens demonstrate superior dynamic strength compared to those of superfine cement-grouted specimens. Conversely, at a higher temperature of 300°C, the compressive strength of the nano-grouted specimen drops significantly, where scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests explain this phenomenon from a microscopic perspective. Additionally, both types of grouted specimens show an increasing tendency in dynamic peak strain with temperature, with nano-grouted specimens generally exhibiting higher peak strain, except at 100°C where it is slightly lower than that of the superfine cement-grouted specimen. SEM analysis further reveals that nano-grouted regions display a characteristic “honeycomb” structure with numerous closely packed small pits, with surface compactness notably higher at 300°C than at 100°C, which is consistent with the conclusion that the mechanical strength at 300°C is higher than that at 100°C in the dynamic impact experiments for nano-grouted specimens. © 2025 Author(s).","","Cements; Concrete construction; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Dynamics; Failure (mechanical); Grouting; Honeycomb structures; Mortar; Condition; Coupling condition; Failure characteristics; Highest temperature; Impact loads; Load coupling; Mechanical characteristics; Peak strains; Scanning electrons; Temperature loads; Compressive strength; Scanning electron microscopy","Sharma, Kunwar Mrityunjai, Characteristics of flow and transport in low-permeability fractured rock based on a channel network model, Advances in Water Resources, 202, (2025); Wu, Jiangyu, Loading directionality of single-through fissure effects on mechanical properties of grouted rock, Physics of Fluids, 37, 5, (2025); Doonechaly Gholizadeh, Nima, Insights from Subsurface Monitoring for Engineering of the Stimulation Pattern in Fractured Reservoirs, Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, 58, 8, pp. 8973-9000, (2025); Sinha, Sankhaneel, Conceptual Frameworks to Explain Reverse Size Effect in Intact Rocks Considering End and Annulus Damage, International Journal of Geomechanics, 25, 6, (2025); Li, Yihui, A spatio-temporal forecasting method of fracture distribution using dynamically exposed rock images in tunnel: Methodology and application, Engineering Geology, 343, (2024); Choi, Jiwon, Evaluating the impact of fracture distribution variation on the hydraulic behavior of rock masses through homogeneity assessment, Engineering Geology, 353, (2025); Yardley, Bruce William D., Penetration of groundwater into crystalline rocks, Hydrogeology Journal, 33, 4, pp. 875-891, (2025); Guo, Jichao, Inference of the preferred direction of fractures in the universal elliptical disc model based on multiple borehole information, International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 193, (2025); Wang, Nanyun, A new method for estimating crack initiation stress of rock under compression based on chaotic characteristic of self-vibration period, International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 192, (2025); Zhang, Jintong, In-situ interference and tracer tests in granite rock with fractures at Beishan exploration tunnel, China, International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 192, (2025)",""

These panels typically consist of three layers: two thin rigid external layers and a thick low-density internal layer with a honeycomb geometric shape. To reduce environmental footprint, eco-friendly materials are encouraged. In this study, we propose an innovative sandwich panel with a core made of Arundo donax rings and skins made of flax fibre-reinforced epoxy composite. Arundo donax is a highly invasive reed in southern Europe. Its rapid growth makes it environmentally advantageous as it can absorb a significant amount of CO<inf>2</inf>which is then sequestered in the panel, enhancing the panel’s sustainability compared to existing alternatives. The honeycomb panels are produced through thermocompression and mechanically tested using pull-off tests and three-point bending. A key novelty of this research is the detailed investigation of the lateral surface roughness of the rings, which has never been studied before. The study explores how different roughness levels affect the adhesion between the core and the skins, the adhesion between the individual Arundo donax rings within the core, as well as the mechanical bending properties of the panel. The results show that polishing treatment significantly impacts all the flexural mechanical properties, especially when performed on lateral surfaces of the rings. In particular, the polishing treatment has increased the flexural strength by 24.25 %, shifting from 19.06 MPa to 25.16 MPa. Numerical simulations are conducted employing Finite Elements with cohesive surface contacts between skins and Arundo donax rings and within the rings. By adjusting the parameters of the cohesive interface, the model can account for different roughness levels and accurately replicate the experimental results. Once calibrated, the model can serve as a design tool. © The Author(s) 2025","Arundo donax; flax fibre; honeycomb panel; sandwich panel; surface roughness","Bending strength; Bending tests; Concretes; Flax; Hydroelasticity; Linen; Mortar; Sandwich structures; Textile fibers; Arundo donax; Bio-based; Composite skins; Epoxy composite; Experimental test; Flax fibres; Honeycomb panels; Lateral surface; Roughness level; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Qi, Chang, Advanced honeycomb designs for improving mechanical properties: A review, Composites Part B: Engineering, 227, (2021); Shi, Shanshan, Load-bearing capacity of composite honeycomb sandwich high-speed train floor, International Journal of Rail Transportation, 13, 1, pp. 171-188, (2025); Ravichandran, Srinath, Experimental and numerical thermal characterization of honeycomb core sandwich structures with glass/polypropylene twill weave composite face sheets, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 231, (2024); Qin, Yinle, Foam-filled aramid honeycomb sandwich composites with high acoustic insulation properties prepared using a unique thermal expansion molding process, Composites Communications, 47, (2024); Son, Min A., Structural origin of negative thermal expansion of cordierite honeycomb ceramics and crystal phase evolution with sintering temperature, Journal of the European Ceramic Society, 39, 7, pp. 2484-2492, (2019); Dutta, Ananta, A novel method of fabricating aluminium honeycomb core by friction stir welding, Thin-Walled Structures, 193, (2023); Habib, Fatah N., Cell geometry effect on in-plane energy absorption of periodic honeycomb structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 5-8, pp. 2369-2380, (2018); Sivakumar, Narain Kumar, Topological approach for optimizing the compressive properties of the square lattice-structured recycled walnut shell Poly Lactic Acid composite, Journal of Building Engineering, 76, (2023); Neje, Ghanshyam, Influence of cell geometrical parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D integrally woven spacer sandwich composites, Composites Part B: Engineering, 182, (2020); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Based on the bionic structure of the mesocarp fiber distribution of coconut, the compression energy absorption of composite materials under three different distribution modes: vertical distribution, horizontal distribution, and shear random distribution was studied. The materials tested include plate materials with two types of hole characteristics: center holes and offset holes. Additionally, a coupling agent is utilized to modify the fiber, allowing for a comparison of compression energy absorption before and after modification and an analysis of the hole destruction process. Results indicate that the coupling agent significantly enhanced all properties of coir fiber composite materials. Specifically, whether the center hole or the offset hole, the randomly distributed fibers modified by the coupling agent exhibited the most balanced performance. However, due to the relatively high cost of coupling agents, in practical scenarios, horizontally distributed fibers performed best overall without the use of coupling agents. The vertically distributed coupling agent fiber in the central hole exhibits the highest peak load and equivalent yield limit, making it suitable for high-stress environments. Furthermore, the random distribution of coupling agent modification remains the most balanced. In the offset holes, the randomly distributed fibers with coupling agent modification are only inferior in resisting lateral displacement compared to the laterally and vertically distributed coupling agent modifications, while excelling in all other properties.

Conventional methods limit the development of complex and multifunctional architectural forms. In contrast, 3D concrete printing (3DCP), an additive manufacturing technique, enables the creation of intricate building envelopes that integrate architectural and energy-efficient functions. Bioinspired design, recognized for its sustainability, has gained traction in this context. This study investigates the thermal and energy performance of various bioinspired and regular 3DCP infill patterns compared to conventional concrete building envelopes in tropical climates. A three-stage methodology was employed. First, bioinspired patterns were identified and evaluated through a literature review. Next, prototype models were developed using Rhino and simulated in ANSYS to assess thermal performance. Finally, energy performance was analyzed using Ladybug and Honeybee tools. The results revealed that honeycomb, spiral, spiderweb, and weaving patterns achieved 35–40% higher thermal and energy efficiency than solid concrete, and about 10% more than the 3DCP sawtooth pattern. The findings highlight the potential of bioinspired spiral infill patterns to enhance the sustainability of 3DCP building envelopes. This opens new avenues for integrating biomimicry into 3DCP construction as a tool for performance optimization and environmental impact reduction. © 2025 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; biomimicry; energy efficiency; simulation; sustainability","","Nairobi, (2020); Kaszyńska, Maria, 3d concrete printing for sustainable construction, Energies, 13, 23, (2020); Biophilic Design the Theory Science and Practice of Bringing Buildings to Life, (2008); Biomimetics in Architecture Architecture of Life and Buildings, (2011); Alkhalidi, Ammar A.T., Energy efficient 3D printed buildings: Material and techniques selection worldwide study, Journal of Building Engineering, 30, (2020); Rattanongphisat, Waraporn, Strategy for energy efficient buildings in tropical climate, Energy Procedia, 52, pp. 10-17, (2014); Suntharalingam, Thadshajini, Energy performance of 3d-printed concrete walls: A numerical study, Buildings, 11, 10, (2021); Abdel-Rahman, Wael Salah Mansour, Thermal performance optimization of parametric building envelope based on bio-mimetic inspiration, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 12, 1, pp. 1133-1142, (2021); Webb, Matthew, Biomimetic building facades demonstrate potential to reduce energy consumption for different building typologies in different climate zones, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 24, 2, pp. 493-518, (2022); Chirat, Régis, The physical basis of mollusk shell chiral coiling, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 48, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Initially, these structures were mainly made of metal or thermosetting composites. Using thermoplastic composites in fabrication highlights a significant step towards better performance. However, constructing thermoplastic sandwich cylindrical structures meets some challenges due to the difficulties in joining thermoplastic composites and the limited reshaping options before curing. In this research, we develop a method that includes a snap-fit technique and a self-reinforced technique to produce thermoplastic sandwich cylindrical structures with a hierarchical honeycomb core. The snap-fit technique uses 2D chips and constructs them into a 3D structure. Additionally, a self-reinforced technique that uses rods made from the same material as the composite matrix enhances the structural connectivity without adding any extra compounds, thus keeping the structures recyclable. The mechanical properties of these sandwich cylindrical structures were evaluated using quasi-static compression, low-speed impact, and compression after impact (CAI) tests. The results show that these structures have exceptional energy absorption ability, with an average specific energy absorption exceeding 4 J/g. Most notably, after impacts of 300, 600, and 900 J, the structure's energy absorption ability and crush force efficiency were pleasantly improved. This demonstrates the difference between thermoplastic and thermoset composites. Unlike brittle fractures, the thermoplastic composite structure undergoes plastic deformation upon impact, presenting a benefit in energy absorption, especially in situations involving secondary impacts. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Compression after impact performance; Dynamic low-velocity impact response; Quasi-static compression performance; Thermoplastic composite","Aerospace industry; Compression testing; Concrete construction; Cylinders (shapes); Honeycomb structures; Reinforced plastics; Sandwich structures; Compression after impact; Compression after impact performance; Compression performance; Dynamic low-velocity impact response; Impact performance; Impact response; Low velocity impact; Quasi-static compression; Quasi-static compression performance; Thermoplastic composite; Marine industry","Ha, Ngoc-san, A review of recent research on bio-inspired structures and materials for energy absorption applications, Composites Part B: Engineering, 181, (2020); Palomba, Giulia, Lightweight sandwich structures for marine applications: a review, Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures, 29, 26, pp. 4839-4864, (2022); Li, Wanxin, Fabrication and Mechanical Testing of Ultralight Folded Lattice-Core Sandwich Cylinders, Engineering, 6, 2, pp. 196-204, (2020); Zhu, Hengyi, Manufacturing and testing of CFRC sandwich cylinder with zero-Poisson's-ratio Kevlar meta-honeycomb core layer, Composites Science and Technology, 230, (2022); Moeinifard, Majid, Experimental investigation on the energy absorption and contact force of unstiffened and grid-stiffened composite cylindrical shells under lateral compression, Composite Structures, 152, pp. 626-636, (2016); Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Ataabadi, Pouria Bahrami, Crushing and energy absorption mechanisms of carbon fiber-epoxy tubes under axial impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 131, pp. 174-189, (2019); Kim, Jung-seok, A study on crushing behaviors of composite circular tubes with different reinforcing fibers, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 38, 4, pp. 198-207, (2011); Yang, Haiyang, Crashworthiness of circular fiber reinforced plastic tubes filled with composite skeletons/aluminum foam under drop-weight impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 160, (2021); Zhang, Jianxun, Low-velocity impact of sandwich beams with fibre-metal laminate face-sheets, Composites Science and Technology, 168, pp. 152-159, (2018)",""

To prevent potential damage, various strategies have been attempted to date with limited success. Among possible strategies, the current study investigated the unique capabilities of energy-absorbing aluminum composites in providing a protective panel to resist impact-induced forces. To achieve a holistic assessment, three core alternatives, i.e., aluminum honeycomb, aluminum foam, and expanded polystyrene foam, sandwiched between aluminum plates, were considered in this study. The selected composite panels had been used as impact-resistant components in mechanical and aerospace engineering applications, but their applications in the civil engineering domain had remained marginal, mainly because of limited studies performed on them. To address the fundamental questions related to the response of this category of composites to over-height collisions, the current study utilized a set of high-fidelity finite-element models. The developed models were validated with a suite of experimental test results from past studies. The models replicated two representative concrete girders, each without and with energy-absorbing composite panels. The added panels were in various configurations, in terms of geometric and material properties. Upon simulating the over-height collision with a range of impact intensities and velocities, key response measures were evaluated, including energy absorption, impact force, and girder damage. This holistic investigation's outcome led to a set of recommendations on the energy-absorbing composites of choice configured to minimize the damage from over-height collisions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Design optimization; Energy-absorbing composites; Impact analysis; Over-height collision; Structural response","Honeycomb structures; Pressure vessels; 'current; Aluminum composites; Composite panels; Concrete superstructures; Design optimization; Energy; Energy-absorbing composite; Impact analysis; Over-height collision; Structural response; Concrete beams and girders; aluminum; civil engineering; collision; composite; concrete structure; energy flow; holistic approach; impact; structural analysis; structural component; structural response","undefined, (2013); Elshazli, Mohamed T., Comprehensive Numerical Modeling of Prestressed Girder Bridges under Low-Velocity Impact, Buildings, 14, 3, (2024); Nguyen, Bella, Understanding the Problem of Bridge and Tunnel Strikes Caused by Over-height Vehicles, Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 3915-3924, (2016); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2008); Yang, Mijia, Analysis of cushion systems for impact protection design of bridges against overheight vehicle collision, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 12, pp. 1220-1228, (2010); Cheng, Shi, Numerical analysis of I-Lam honeycomb sandwich panels for collision protection of reinforced concrete beams, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 19, 4, pp. 497-522, (2017); Li, Xiangcheng, Experimental study on out-of-plane mechanical and energy absorption properties of combined hexagonal aluminum honeycombs under dynamic impact, Materials and Design, 194, (2020); Pietras, Daniel, Out-of-plane crushing response of aluminum honeycombs in-situ filled with graphene-reinforced polyurethane foam, Composite Structures, 249, (2020); Han, Qigang, Study on mechanical properties of multi-structure dactyl-inspired sandwich honeycomb with basalt fiber, Composite Structures, 247, (2020)",""

Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), a fundamental component in the construction industry due to its lightness, low cost, sound insulation, shock absorbent, and fire and corrosion resistance, is an efficient candidate for CSP. This paper offers a thorough experimental and numerical examination of AAC-based hierarchical multicore CSPs under quasi-static indentation and high-velocity impact (HVI) loading. Three panel configurations, including single-core, double-core, and triple-core, were constructed by thermosetting, utilizing woven E/glass fiber fabric sheets and AAC cores. Thereafter, experiments were tested to evaluate their energy absorption and perforation behavior. Experimental findings demonstrated that double-core panels displayed superior specific energy absorption (SEA) load-bearing capability under quasi-static and HVI loading conditions, surpassing single and triple-core configurations. The principal energy absorption methods comprised core crushing, fiber pull-out, and delamination, which were affected by the core topology and face sheet thickness. Numerical simulations by LS-DYNA were validated logically versus experimental results with deviations around 10 %, affirming the efficacy of the FEM in accurately representing damage responses and failure mechanisms. This work illustrates that multicore AAC-based CSPs provide superior structural performance and impact resistance, especially in arrangements featuring several cores. The results offer significant insights into the design of lightweight, impact-resistant composite structures for use in aerospace, defense, and construction sectors. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","AAC; Ballistic limit velocity; Composite sandwich panel; Energy absorption; High-velocity impact; Quasi-static Indentation","Autoclaved aerated concrete; Compaction; Concrete construction; Corrosion resistance; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Shock absorbers; Structural panels; Ballistic limit velocity; Composite sandwich panels; Concrete core; Energy; High-velocity impact; Impact loadings; Multi-cores; Quasi-static; Quasi-static indentation; Sound insulation; computer simulation; concrete structure; construction industry; construction material; energy dissipation; experimental study; hierarchical system; impact; loading test; model test; model validation; numerical model","J Eng Struct, (2018); J Constr Build Mater, (2017); Daniel, Isaac M., Fabrication, testing and analysis of composite sandwich beams, Composites Science and Technology, 60, 12-13, pp. 2455-2463, (2000); Int J Impact Eng, (2015); Garrido, Mário A., Quasi-static indentation and impact in glass-fibre reinforced polymer sandwich panels for civil and ocean engineering applications, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 1, pp. 194-221, (2021); Taghizadeh, Seyed Ahmad, Experimental study on quasi-static penetration process of cylindrical indenters with different nose shapes into the hybrid composite panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 53, 1, pp. 107-123, (2019); Taghizadeh, Seyed Ahmad, Investigation of novel multi-layer sandwich panels under quasi-static indentation loading using experimental and numerical analyses, Thin-Walled Structures, 160, (2021); Taghizadeh, Seyed Ahmad, Characterization of compressive behavior of PVC foam infilled composite sandwich panels with different corrugated core shapes, Thin-Walled Structures, 135, pp. 160-172, (2019); Compos Part B Eng, (2018); Compos Struct, (2018)",""

Channels, or C-shaped shear connectors, are commonly used. However, a research gap is the difficulty of constraining the ends of the channels to the steel face plates. In this research, it is proposed to use a complete weld at one end and a slot weld at the other end to ensure two-end welding of channels to the steel face plates. To study the flexural behavior of SCS beams with the proposed structure, eight experimental SCS beam samples were created. These included one sample with a conventional concrete core and seven samples with a Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC) core, incorporating different contents of steel fiber and polypropylene (PP) fibers. The samples underwent a four-point bending test. Additionally, to evaluate the impact of geometric parameters, the numerical model was validated using experimental results. The results showed that slot welding can be a suitable alternative to constrain the inaccessible end of channel shear connectors. This method effectively maintains the integrity of the layers and significantly reduces the likelihood of failure at the weld points. Observations also indicated that incorporating 1 % steel fibers or polypropylene fibers into RPC provides the best performance in controlling shear cracks, enhancing maximum strength, and improving energy absorption. Additionally, the results demonstrated that an improper arrangement of shear connectors can significantly lower the load-displacement diagram level. © 2025 The Authors","C-shape connectors; Failure modes; Flexural behavior; Reactive powder concrete; Steel-concrete-steel composites","Bending strength; Bending tests; Concrete beams and girders; Fracture mechanics; Honeycomb structures; Hydroelasticity; Steel powder metallurgy; Welds; C shape; C-shape connector; Concrete core; Flexural behavior; Reactive powder concrete; Shear connector; Steel beams; Steel composites; Steel concrete; Steel-concrete-steel composite; Sandwich structures","Solomon, S.

The force-time history, displacement-time history, failure modes, and strain development were analysed to reveal the effects of the protective layer, impact energy, and reinforcement ratio on the dynamic behaviour of composite slabs. Test results revealed that the sandwich panel significantly mitigated shear failure in the reinforced concrete slab. Compared to the reinforced concrete slab, composite slabs developed reduced peak forces and deformations under impact of the same energy. A higher impact energy resulted in increased deformations and damage to the slabs, with the failure mode transforming from bending failure to a combination of bending and punching shear failures. Composite slabs with larger reinforcement ratios could develop greater impact resistances. Furthermore, finite element models were developed for composite slabs under impact. Numerical results show that the sandwich panel develops a cushioning effect and absorbs a large portion of the impact energy initially. Parametric studies reveal that compared to increasing the reinforcement diameter, increasing the reinforcement ratio by reducing the reinforcement spacing is more effective in improving the impact resistance of composite slabs. Besides, although higher-strength concrete can improve the impact resistance of composite slabs, it also increases the risk of punching failure as the concrete is more brittle.

Three types of concrete panels are considered namely, solid concrete panel (SCP), concrete sandwich panels containing recycled tire crumb rubber as core (CRSP), and expanded polystyrene foam as core (FSP). The panels are reinforced with steel mesh or steel fibers. A total of 12 panels are cast in this study. Six panels are reinforced using steel mesh, and the other six panels are reinforced using steel fibers. The impact test is carried out by dropping a weight from a varying height to input impact energy, which can cause various levels of damage for all specimens. The structural performance is discussed in detail, including failure modes, impact force, deflection, and strain. It is found that the core material greatly affects the structural response of the precast concrete panels. The sandwich panel containing recycled tire crumb rubber performed well in terms of rebounding force, permanent deflections, and damage behavior by partially absorbing the impact energy in both types of reinforced concrete panels. In CRSP and FSP, the maximum deflection to permanent deflection ratio rose from 1.19 in SCP to 2.67 and 2.01, respectively. A decrease of 70% in strain value from the first impact to permanent strain was recorded in CRSP when reinforced using conventional steel mesh. In comparison to its counterpart FSP, the CRSP exhibited a significantly smaller fracture width on the tension face as a result of the core's ability to dissipate impact energy, resulting in lower deflections and less damage to the panel. The CRSP reinforced with steel fibers demonstrated comparable performance to the counterpart FSP in terms of energy absorption and deflection reduction; however, it performed noticeably better than the SCP reinforced with steel fibers by reducing residual deflection by 51.8 mm. Consequently, recycled tire crumb rubber can be used as a sustainable alternative to traditional core materials in precast concrete panels. © 2025 fib.

In order to avert the impairment of reinforced concrete bridge piers (RCBPs) under the impact of vehicles, three kinds of Mg–Al alloy AlSi10Mg anti-collision structures designed by selective laser melting (SLM) printing were tested by the numerical simulation method in this study: an ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) anti-collision structure, a bio-inspired honeycomb column thin-walled structure (BHTS) buffer interlayer, and a UHPC–BHTS composite structure were used to reduce the damage degree of RCBPs caused by vehicle impact. In accordance with the prototype configuration of the pier, a scaled model with a scale ratio of 1:10 was fabricated. Three anti-collision structures were installed on the reinforced concrete (RC) column specimens for the steel ball impact test. The impact simulation under low-energy and high-energy input was carried out successively, and the protective effect of the three anti-collision devices on the RC column was comprehensively evaluated. The outcomes demonstrate that the BHTS buffer interlayer and the UHPC–BHTS composite structure are capable of converting the shear failure of RC columns into bending failure, thereby exerting an efficacious role in safeguarding RC columns. The damage was evaluated under all impact conditions of BHTS and UHPC–BHTS composite structures, and the RC column only suffered slight damage, while the RC column without protective measures and the RC column with the UHPC anti-collision structure alone showed serious damage and collapse behavior. This approach can offer a valuable reference for anti-collision design within analogous projects. © 2025 by the authors.","bio-inspired honeycomb structure; numerical simulation; reinforced concrete; SLM; structural impact","Accidents; Biomimetics; Collision avoidance; Columns (structural); Concrete bridges; Disasters; Numerical methods; Piers; Structural design; Structure (composition); Ultra-high performance concrete; Vehicles; Anti collision; Bio-inspired honeycomb structure; Composites structures; High-performance concrete; Reinforced concrete bridge piers; Reinforced concrete column; Selective laser melting; Structural impact; Thin-walled structures; Ultra high performance; Honeycomb structures; Numerical models; Reinforced concrete","Xie, Suchao, Mechanical properties of Nomex honeycomb sandwich panels under dynamic impact, Composite Structures, 235, (2020); Xue, Xinwei, Study on the impact resistance of honeycomb sandwich structures under low-velocity/heavy mass, Composite Structures, 226, (2019); Han, Qigang, Experimental investigation on impact and bending properties of a novel dactyl-inspired sandwich honeycomb with carbon fiber, Construction and Building Materials, 253, (2020); Pydah, Anup, Blast loading of bumper shielded hybrid two-core Miura-ori/honeycomb core sandwich plates, Thin-Walled Structures, 129, pp. 45-57, (2018); He, Wentao, Effect of structural parameters on low-velocity impact behavior of aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP face sheets, Thin-Walled Structures, 137, pp. 411-432, (2019); Demartino, Cristoforo, Response of shear-deficient reinforced circular RC columns under lateral impact loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 109, pp. 196-213, (2017); Zhang, Dahai, Drop-weight impact behavior of honeycomb sandwich panels under a spherical impactor, Composite Structures, 168, pp. 633-645, (2017); Xiang, Jinwu, Energy absorption characteristics of bio-inspired honeycomb structure under axial impact loading, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 696, pp. 283-289, (2017); Lu, Jingyi, Behaviors of steel–concrete-steel sandwich panel with aluminum foam-filled energy absorbing supports under low-velocity impact, Engineering Structures, 292, (2023); Forés-Garriga, Albert, Lightweight hybrid composite sandwich structures with additively manufactured cellular cores, Thin-Walled Structures, 191, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Mass timber construction, particularly using cross-laminated timber (CLT), offers a promising low-carbon alternative. This study aims to calculate the embodied carbon emissions and biogenic carbon storage of a CLT-based affordable housing project, 340+ Dixwell in New Haven, Connecticut. This project was designed using a honeycomb structural system, where mass timber floors and roofs are supported by mass timber-bearing walls. The authors are not aware of a prior study that has evaluated the life cycle impacts of honeycomb mass timber construction while considering Timber Use Intensity (TUI). Unlike traditional post-and-beam systems, the honeycomb design uses nearly twice the amount of timber, resulting in higher carbon sequestration. This makes the study significant from a sustainability perspective. This study follows International Standard Organization (ISO) standards 14044, 21930, and 21931 and reports the results for both lifecycle stages A1–A3 and A1–A5. The analysis covers key building components, including the substructure, superstructure, and enclosure, with timber, concrete, metals, glass, and insulation as the materials assessed. Material quantities were extracted using Autodesk Revit®, and the life cycle assessment (LCA) was evaluated using One Click LCA (2015)®. The A1 to A3 stage results of this honeycomb building revealed that, compared to conventional mass timber housing structures such as Adohi Hall and Heartwood, it demonstrates the lowest embodiedf carbon emissions and the highest biogenic carbon storage per square foot. This outcome is largely influenced by its higher Timber Use Intensity (TUI). Similarly, the A1-A5 findings indicate that the embodied carbon emissions of this honeycomb construction are 40% lower than the median value for other multi-family residential buildings, as assessed using the Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF) Embodied Carbon Emissions Benchmark Study of various buildings. Moreover, the biogenic carbon storage per square foot of this building is 60% higher than the average biogenic carbon storage of reference mass timber construction types. © 2025 by the authors.","cross-laminated timber (CLT); honeycomb; life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainable Construction; Timber Use Intensity (TUI)","affordable housing; building construction; carbon emission; carbon storage; construction material; life cycle analysis; standard (regulation); timber; Connecticut; New Haven; United States","Climate Change 2021 the Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2021); Emissions Gap Report 2019, (2019); Gu, Hongmei, Mass timber building life cycle assessment methodology for the U.S. regional case studies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 24, (2021); Ürge-Vorsatz, Diana A., Advances toward a net-zero global building sector, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 45, pp. 227-269, (2020); Building Materials and the Climate Constructing A New Future, (2023); Syal, Matt G., United States-India collaborative research directions in urban housing and supporting infrastructure, Journal of Architectural Engineering, 12, 4, pp. 163-167, (2006); Sharma, Aashish, Life cycle assessment of buildings: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, 1, pp. 871-875, (2011); Duan, Zhuocheng, Life cycle assessment of mass timber construction: A review, Building and Environment, 221, (2022); Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment Wblca of Mass Timber Systems European Vs North American Mass Timber Vs Steel, (2019); Woodworks Wood Products Council Mass Timber Structural Design Engineering Modern Timber Structures","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

To address this research gap, the present study investigates the shear strength behavior of honeycomb beams and evaluates the reinforcing effects of floor slabs on this failure mode. A detailed mechanical performance analysis was conducted on eight honeycomb (composite) beam specimens and 246 finite element models. The study systematically examines the influence of various parameters, including floor slab dimensions (width and thickness), opening characteristics (opening ratio and shape), and steel beam flange properties, on the bearing capacity, failure modes, and strain distribution of honeycomb beams. The findings indicate that all specimens exhibit hole-edge tearing as the primary failure mechanism following shear strength failure. Honeycomb beams with circular and hexagonal openings demonstrate significantly higher shear bearing capacities compared to those with rectangular openings. Among the factors investigated, the opening shape exerts a more substantial influence on bearing capacity than the opening ratio. Additionally, concrete floor slabs effectively mitigate shear deformation in honeycomb beams. Notably, the shear bearing capacity of honeycomb composite beams is significantly higher than that of honeycomb beams, with the most pronounced increase—up to 93.1 %—observed in honeycomb composite beams with rectangular openings. Furthermore, the thickness of the floor slab has a more significant impact on the bearing capacity than its width. Based on these findings, calculation formulas for predicting the shear strength of honeycomb beams and honeycomb composite beams are proposed. These formulas provide accurate estimations of shear bearing capacity under strength failure modes, offering valuable guidance for design and engineering applications. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge and serves as a reference for the design and analysis of honeycomb beams and honeycomb composite beams. © 2025","Bending-shear interaction; Failure mechanism; Honeycomb beam; Honeycomb composite beam; Shear bearing capacity","Bending strength; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Failure modes; Floors; Sandwich structures; Shear deformation; Shear strain; Shear strength; Shear stress; Steel beams and girders; Structural design; Wooden beams and girders; Bending-shear interactions; Composite beam; Failure mechanism; Floor slabs; Honeycomb beam; Honeycomb composite; Honeycomb composite beam; Shear bearing capacity; Shears strength; Strength failures; Honeycomb structures","Geng, Kai, Experimental study on the mechanical behaviour of castellated composite beams under a negative bending moment, Structures, 47, pp. 953-965, (2023); França, Gabriela M., An appraisal of the Vierendeel mechanism capacity of cellular beams with sinusoidal openings, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 198, (2022); Dong, Yang, Experimental study on seismic behavior of steel structure with cellular beams and composite concrete slab, Structures, 34, pp. 507-522, (2021); Dai, Xianghe, Numerical study of steel–concrete composite cellular beam using demountable shear connectors, Structures, 51, pp. 1328-1340, (2023); Tsavdaridis, Konstantinos Daniel, Cellular beam end-posts with two connection types, end notches and infill plates, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 215, (2024); Jia, Lianguang, Influence of the local buckling of web on the bearing capacity of a castellated beam/composite beam under pure bending, Structures, 63, (2024); Wang, Peijun, Vertical shear buckling capacity of web-posts in castellated steel beams with fillet corner hexagonal web openings, Engineering Structures, 75, pp. 315-326, (2014); Kerdal, Djamel Eddine, Failure modes for castellated beams, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 4, 4, pp. 295-315, (1984); Zirakian, Tadeh, Distortional buckling of castellated beams, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 62, 9, pp. 863-871, (2006); Tsavdaridis, Konstantinos Daniel, Experimental behaviour of non-seismical RWS connections with perforated beams under cyclic actions, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 183, (2021)",""

These experimental trials were explicitly designed to ascertain the ballistic limit velocity (BLV) of FML reinforced AAC subjecting to impact loading of a rigid flat-nosed projectile. In conjunction with experimental investigations, an analytical model based on closed-form solutions employing energy equations was meticulously developed to offer a deeper analysis of the impact event. This analysis encompassed the identification of various damage mechanisms that manifest during high-velocity impacts, including core crushing, tensile fracture, fiber breakage, delamination, plugging and the formation of petals. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis using dimensionless variables was employed to provide a more profound insight into the influence of diverse parameters such as the mass and initial velocity of the projectile. Additionally, three-dimensional finite element method (3D FEM) simulations via the Ls-Dyna package were carried out to estimate the effects of various projectile nose shapes on ballistic performance, failure modes, energy absorption (EA), and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the target. The simulations revealed that the projectile nose shape can induce various damage mechanisms within the FMLRAAC panel. During the impact process, the E glass/epoxy composite layer undergo matrix cracking, fiber breakage occurred along with delamination, and consequently, the Al skin underwent plastic deformations until this layer fractured permanently at the impact position. As a result insulating AAC in a sandwich structure between two FML face skins reproduce a significant strength and stability. Moreover, the manufacturing of FMLRAAC in construction is a simple process to promote its structural capability especially for hazardous environment as load bearing structural material. © The Author(s) 2025.","autoclaved aerated concrete; ballistic limit velocity; Composite sandwich panels; fiber metal laminate; perforation","Compaction; Concrete slabs; Delamination; Failure modes; Fiber reinforced concrete; Fiber reinforced metals; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Paper laminates; Perforating; Sandwich structures; Sensitivity analysis; Structural analysis; Autoclaved aerated concrete; Ballistic limit velocity; Composite sandwich panels; Damage mechanism; Face skins; Fiber breakages; Fibre Metal Laminates; High-velocity impact; Perforation","Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Zhang, Guoqi, Response of sandwich structures with pyramidal truss cores under the compression and impact loading, Composite Structures, 100, pp. 451-463, (2013); Sun, Guangyong, Lightweight hybrid materials and structures for energy absorption: A state-of-the-art review and outlook, Thin-Walled Structures, 172, (2022); Quanjin, Ma, A review of the recent trends on core structures and impact response of sandwich panels, Journal of Composite Materials, 55, 18, pp. 2513-2555, (2021); Hassanpour Roudbeneh, Fatemeh, Experimental investigation of impact loading on honeycomb sandwich panels filled with foam, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 24, 2, pp. 199-210, (2019); Quek, Ser Tong, Development of functionally-graded cementitious panel against high-velocity small projectile impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 37, 8, pp. 928-941, (2010); Xi, Huifeng, A numerical study of temperature effect on the penetration of aluminum foam sandwich panels under impact, Composites Part B: Engineering, 130, pp. 217-229, (2017); Ahmadi, Hamed, High velocity impact on composite sandwich panels with nano-reinforced syntactic foam core, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); Wang, Bing, Low-velocity impact characteristics and residual tensile strength of carbon fiber composite lattice core sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 42, 4, pp. 891-897, (2011); Lu, Lingling, Effects of random damages on dynamic behavior of metallic sandwich panel with truss core, Composites Part B: Engineering, 116, pp. 278-290, (2017)",""

This study confirms that the use of thermoplastic sandwich structures is a viable and promising option for crash safety and the lightweight design of battery pack bottom guards. Highlights: The thermoplastic honeycomb sandwich structure is polypropylene-based. The use of advanced high strength steel is inspired by fiber metal laminates. Both thickness and surface density are considered in the structural design. The steel plate placed on the impacted side improves the flexural behavior. The sandwich structure has excellent impact resistance and lightweight level. © 2024 Society of Plastics Engineers.","flexural properties; impact performance; polypropylene; sandwich structure; steel plate","Battery Pack; Bending strength; Bending tests; Building materials; Concrete buildings; Dams; Dynamic response; Fiber reinforced metals; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hybrid composites; Laminated composites; Levees; Plastic laminates; Plates (structural components); Stress relief; Structural dynamics; Advanced high strength steel; Battery pack; Fiber reinforced polypropylene; Fibre Metal Laminates; Flexural properties; Glass fibre reinforced; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact performance; Low-velocity; Steel plates; Sandwich structures","Zhao, Ying, Mechanical Properties and Optimization Analysis on Battery Box with Honeycomb Sandwich Composite Structure, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 24, 1, pp. 1-14, (2023); Geisbauer, Christian, Scenarios Involving Accident-Damaged Electric Vehicles, Transportation Research Procedia, 55, pp. 1484-1489, (2021); Xu, Dongxin, Data-driven modelling and evaluation of a battery-pack system's mechanical safety against bottom cone impact, Energy, 290, (2024); Pan, Yongjun, Crush and crash analysis of an automotive battery-pack enclosure for lightweight design, International Journal of Crashworthiness, 27, 2, pp. 500-509, (2022); Biharta, Michael Alfred Stephenson, Design and optimization of lithium-ion battery protector with auxetic honeycomb for in-plane impact using machine learning method, Frontiers in Energy Research, 11, (2023); Wang, Weiwei, Design optimization of a novel negative Poisson's ratio non-module battery pack system considering crashworthiness and heat dissipation, Composite Structures, 275, (2021); Xiang, Junxian, Joint interface optimization of all-CFRTP composite honeycomb prepared by ultrasonic multi-spot welding, Composites Science and Technology, 248, (2024); Li, Ruoxu, Bio-inspired honeycomb structures to improve the crashworthiness of a battery-pack system, Engineering Failure Analysis, 158, (2024); Yue, Zengshen, Elevated shock resistance of all-metallic sandwich beams with honeycomb-supported corrugated cores, Composites Part B: Engineering, 242, (2022); Chen, Boyue, Multifunctional cellular sandwich structures with optimised core topologies for improved mechanical properties and energy harvesting performance, Composites Part B: Engineering, 238, (2022)",""

The test research involved parameters of the spacing and arrangement of the connector, and 4-point bending tests were conducted. The five specimens' flexural properties and composite action were analyzed, and formulas for calculating the cracking load and ultimate bearing capacity of such fully composite panels were proposed. Finite element models were established for parameter analysis, including the ratio of the total rib width of the connector (b<inf>rib</inf>) to the panel width (b) (b<inf>rib</inf>/b), the ratio of the rib width (b<inf>0</inf>) to spacing (S) of a single concrete rib connector (b<inf>0</inf>/S), and the ratio of the connector thickness (t<inf>2</inf>) to the panel thickness (t) (t<inf>2</inf>/t). The results indicated that b<inf>0</inf>/S has a significant impact on the composite action. The concept of design composite action (DCA<inf>d</inf>) was proposed, and a formula for calculating the DCA<inf>d</inf> of these panels was established. In comparison with existing formulas that calculate the degree of composite action (DCA) based on experimental results, this formula directly determined the panel's DCA based on design parameters. The results of DCA calculation are of great significance for practical engineering design and construction applications.

An increased thickness of expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulation is inserted between the ribbed concrete exterior panels joined by the connectors to resist flexural moment collaboratively. Six specimens were designed to study the sandwich wall panel's mechanical properties, including component tests under axial pull-out and compressive loads, double shear, and full-scale wall panel bending tests. The component test results indicate that the new type of connectors demonstrate good anchoring performance with concrete and shear transfer ability, and the full-scale bending test reveals that the exterior concrete panels achieve a complete composite mechanical performance before failure.

A total of 24 specimens, divided into 11 groups, were prepared for experimental analysis. Three distinct load amplitudes (5.4 kN, 4.0 kN, 2.7 kN) and three fatigue loading cycles (30,000, 50,000, 80,000) were established as loading conditions. The experimental protocol included out-of-plane tension–compression fatigue tests followed by post-fatigue shear-bending tests. The influence of varying load amplitudes and fatigue loading cycles on failure modes, load–displacement relationships, and bearing capacity alterations was systematically examined. A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to evaluate the statistical significance of these factors. The findings reveal that the predominant shear-bending failure modes post-fatigue damage are connector fracture and concrete crushing in the anchorage zone. Specifically, under a load amplitude of 2.7 kN and 30,000 cycles, the shear-bending capacity of the specimens exhibited a minimal reduction of 1.82% compared to the ultimate capacity of undamaged specimens. Conversely, at a load amplitude of 5.4 kN and 80,000 cycles, the shear-bending capacity experienced a substantial decline of 37.11%. Both load amplitude and fatigue loading cycles were found to significantly impact the shear-bending capacity, with fatigue loading cycles demonstrating a more pronounced effect. This research provides critical insights for the design and assessment of sandwich insulation composite wall panels, particularly in the context of long-term fatigue damage and its implications on structural performance, thereby contributing valuable theoretical and practical knowledge to the field. © 2025 by the authors.","bending-shear load-bearing capacity; failure modes; fatigue damage; GFRP connectors; sandwich insulation composite wall panels","Anchorage zones; Bending tests; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Compression testing; Elastomers; Fatigue load; Fatigue testing; Fiber reinforced concrete; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hydroelasticity; Sandwich structures; Shear stress; Bending-shear; Bending-shear load-bearing capacity; Composite wall; Glass fiber reinforced polymer connector; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); Insulation composite; Load-bearing capacity; Sandwich insulation composite wall panel; Sandwich insulations; Shear loads; Wall panels; Fatigue damage","Energy Conserv Environ Prot, (2022); Einea, Amin, State-of-the-art of Precast Concrete Sandwich Panels, PCI Journal, 36, 6, pp. 78-92, (1991); Abdul Ghafar, Wahab, Experimental and Numerical Study of an Innovative Infill Web-Strips Steel Plate Shear Wall with Rigid Beam-to-Column Connections, Buildings, 12, 10, (2022); Abdul Ghafar, Wahab, Seismic performance investigation of an innovative steel shear wall with semi-rigid beam-to-column connections, Frontiers in Materials, 9, (2022); Building Structure, (2020); Compos Sci Eng, (2024); Chen, An, Experimental investigation and finite element analysis of flexural behavior of insulated concrete sandwich panels with FRP plate shear connectors, Engineering Structures, 98, pp. 95-108, (2015); Cadenazzi, Thomas, Cost and environmental analyses of reinforcement alternatives for a concrete bridge, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 16, 4, pp. 787-802, (2020); Manalo, Allan C., Comparative durability of GFRP composite reinforcing bars in concrete and in simulated concrete environments, Cement and Concrete Composites, 109, (2020); Maranan, Ginghis B., Shear behaviour of geopolymer-concrete beams transversely reinforced with continuous rectangular GFRP composite spirals, Composite Structures, 187, pp. 454-465, (2018)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

However, exhaustive search of the entire design space to optimize horizontal stiffness is time-consuming. Therefore, this research aims to develop a classifier to filter out less promising sections, reducing the search space and improving efficiency. Combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offers computational- and time-efficient solutions for classification tasks applicable to the design of hollow building components. However, the impact of different BNN configurations within this hybrid remains underexplored. To address this, we proposed and compared eight hybrid models with different BNNs to identify the optimal hybrid model based on classification accuracy. Results show that the BNN featuring a Bayesian layer followed by two linear layers (BLL) is most effective, achieving around 90 % classification accuracy in both training and testing datasets. To assess search space reduction, we test the models on 2000 samples. The hybrid model featuring BLL in its BNN achieves the best performance, with a 26.85 % search space reduction in the search space. Compared to a traditional statistical model, which achieves a 17.7 % search space reduction, the optimal hybrid model demonstrates superior effectiveness. The present study focuses on single-objective optimization, specifically targeting the performance of horizontal stiffness in directions more sensitive to the configuration change of morphed honeycomb channels in the hollow component. Future work will expand to multi-objective optimization, concurrently considering other mechanical properties for a more comprehensive optimization. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian neural networks (BNNs); Graph neural networks (GNNs); Machine learning (ML) classifier; Morphed honeycomb section; Search space reduction","Bayesian networks; Honeycomb structures; Light weight concrete; Multilayer neural networks; Seismic design; Bayesian neural network; Bayesian neural networks; Graph neural network; Graph neural networks; Hybrid model; Learning classifiers; Machine learning classifier; Machine-learning; Morphed honeycomb section; Search space reduction; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; concrete; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; seismic design; stiffness","Adibi, Mahdi, Evaluation of mechanical behaviour of the rubberized PCC mortar in fixed W/C ratio, Cogent Engineering, 7, 1, (2020); AlAjarmeh, Omar S., Hollow concrete columns: Review of structural behavior and new designs using GFRP reinforcement, Engineering Structures, 203, (2020); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2013); Arxiv, (2015); Chen, Geng, A Bayesian statistics based investigation of binder hardening's influence on the effective strength of particulate reinforced metal matrix composites (PRMMC), International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 159, pp. 151-164, (2019); undefined, (2020); Cojocaru, Vasile, On the Behavior of Honeycomb, Grid and Triangular PLA Structures under Symmetric and Asymmetric Bending, Micromachines, 14, 1, (2023); Cortesi, Marilisa, A comparative analysis of 2D and 3D experimental data for the identification of the parameters of computational models, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Creswell, Antonia, Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 35, 1, pp. 53-65, (2018)",""

The novelty and distinction of this research lie in its broad investigation of the influence of various slab thicknesses, types, and damping ratios on failure analysis in a total of 54 scenarios, considering two engineering methods, six slab models, three thicknesses, and three damping ratios. A five-span five-bay RC structure model was analyzed using SAP2000 and ELS programs. A three-stage column removal was performed, with 3-second intervals to allow for sufficient vibration damping. In order to observe behavioral changes not only one corner column, but also with the columns that follow those adjacent to it on both sides were removed. The displacement values of the corner column were then compared in both cases. While AEM, for each slab piece, used cuboid-shaped elements connected by springs, applying a “thin structure correction factor” to consider shear and flexure behavior, FEM analyzed five slab types. AEM elements connected by springs, whereas FEM employs linear elements and the distributed plasticity concept (fiber hinges). The findings reveal that AEM exhibits higher rigidity and damping within the first second, contrasting with FEM's 2–2.50 seconds. The layered-shell slab model, characterized by its comprehensiveness and realism, exhibits more rigid behavior. Therefore, AEM model, particularly when considering the thickest layered-shell slab structure, relatively aligns with the FEM model. Increasing the slab thickness has a greater impact on the rigidity of the FEM model, thereby enhancing its resilience. Conversely, in the AEM-based solid model, an increase in slab weight (thickness) results in more displacement. A validation study was conducted by comparing the results with a former experimental test. Overall, the study highlights the viability of both methods for PC analysis, as long as their characteristics are well-understood. The AEM serves as an alternative to FEM, particularly in scenarios involving multiple element removals, considering computational time and modeling practicality. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers","Applied element method (AEM); Extreme loading for structures (ELS); Finite element method (FEM); Shell-plate elements; Solid mechanics","Columns (structural); Compressive stress; Cracks; Dynamic response; Hinges; Honeycomb structures; Hydraulic structures; Plates (structural components); Pressure vessels; Rigid structures; Shells (structures); Steel beams and girders; Stress concentration; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Applied element method; Element method; Extreme loading for structure; Extreme loadings; Finite element method; Plate elements; Shell plates; Shell-plate element; Solid mechanics; Rigidity","undefined, (2007); Lu, Jinxian, Progressive collapse of Murrah Federal Building: Revisited, Journal of Building Engineering, 57, (2022); undefined, (2005); Public Rev Draft, (2012); Bredean, Lucian A., The influence of beams design and the slabs effect on the progressive collapse resisting mechanisms development for RC framed structures, Engineering Failure Analysis, 91, pp. 527-542, (2018); Steer Eeri 2023 Mw 7 8 Kahramanmaras Turkiye Earthquake Sequence Joint Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report Pvrr, (2023); undefined, (2023); Concrete Structures Under Blast Loading Dynamic Response Damage and Residual Strength Resilience of Cities to Terrorist and Other Threats, (2008); Singh, Harmanpreet, A contemporary review on progressive collapse, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 1326, 1, (2024); Thai, Huu Tai, A review on modular construction for high-rise buildings, Structures, 28, pp. 1265-1290, (2020)",""

Two single-span, two-story models at a 1:2 scale were designed and tested under low reverse cyclic loading using horizontal actuators to apply a cyclic load history. The only variable distinguishing the two specimens was the presence or absence of a sandwich-insulated wall. The deformation and failure patterns of the specimens were observed, and seismic performance parameters such as hysteresis loops, skeleton curves, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity were analyzed. The experimental results indicated that the CFT-truss column frame exhibits excellent seismic performance, with its ductility meeting the elastic-plastic inter-story drift limits required for seismic design. Furthermore, the CFT-truss column frame with insulated wall panels exhibited a 19.7 % higher load-bearing capacity and 1.6 times greater yield stiffness by preventing local buckling of the columns, while maintaining minimal impact on the energy dissipation capacity of the specimens. Finite element (FE) models were developed and validated against the experimental results. The FE analysis in stress maps indicated that damage is primarily concentrated in the web members, resulting in little impact of changes in strength and dimensions on seismic performance of other components. Specifically, the load-bearing capacity and yield stiffness are positively correlated with the steel tube strength, the beam-to-column stiffness ratio, and the thickness of the concrete panels. In contrast, the concrete slab strength has a minor impact. Additionally, as the axial compression ratio increases, both the peak bearing capacity and ductility initially increase and then decrease. © 2024","CFT-truss column frame; Experimental study; Numerical parametric analyses; Sandwich-insulated wall; Seismic behavior","Axial compression; Columns (structural); Concrete beams and girders; Concrete buildings; Concrete slabs; Convergence of numerical methods; Cyclic loads; Earthquake effects; Energy dissipators; Honeycomb structures; Mortar; Sandwich structures; Seismic design; Seismic response; Tall buildings; Tubular steel structures; Walls (structural partitions); Concrete filled steel tube truss; Concrete-filled steel tube truss column frame; Experimental study; Insulated walls; Load-bearing capacity; Numerical parametric analyze; Parametric analysis; Sandwich-insulated wall; Seismic behaviour; Seismic Performance; Trusses","Du, Yansheng, Seismic behaviors of CFT-column frame-four-corner bolted connected buckling-restrained steel plate shear walls using ALC/RAC panels, Thin-Walled Structures, 195, (2024); Alatshan, Faesal, Stiffened concrete-filled steel tubes: A systematic review, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); Du, Yansheng, Eccentric compression behaviors of iron tailings and recycled aggregate concrete-filled steel tube columns, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 223, (2024); Huang, Wei, Experimental and numerical study on the compressive behavior of micro-expansive ultra-high-performance concrete-filled steel tube columns, Construction and Building Materials, 254, (2020); Wang, Yingtao, Hysteretic behavior of square CFT columns with binding bars, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 131, pp. 162-175, (2017); Gao, Dinghui, Behavior of CFRP confined rectangular high-strength concrete-filled steel tubular columns under eccentric compression, Engineering Structures, 321, (2024); Wang, Yuhang, Experimental Study on Torsion Behavior of Concrete Filled Steel Tube Columns subjected to Eccentric Compression, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 129, pp. 119-128, (2017); Yang, Di, Energy path of circular concrete-filled steel tube stub columns under axial compression, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 213, (2024); Chen, Zhihua, Experiment of axial compression bearing capacity for crisscross section special-shaped column composed of concrete-filled square steel tubes, Tianjin Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue yu Gongcheng Jishu Ban)/Journal of Tianjin University Science and Technology, 39, 11, pp. 1275-1282, (2006); Steel Construction, (2006)",""

The temperature data are then imported into ABAQUS numerical models of non-prismatic composite girders with trapezoidal steel corrugated webs (TSCWs) for thermo-structural analysis by the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element (FE) coupling method. The study presents a comprehensive investigation into the shearing performance differences of three common bridge configurations—simply supported girders, continuous girders, and rigid frame girders—under localized fire conditions, offering insightful comparisons with room temperature conditions. Additionally, this work examines the influence of elevated fire temperature on the Resal effect in non-prismatic girders with TSCWs. The findings indicate that, compared to room temperature conditions, the shearing stress distribution in the fire-affected mid-span of these girders becomes uneven, with a significant concentration of stress observed at the junction between the TSCWs and concrete slabs. Notably, the additional bending moments induced by the elevated fire temperature counteract the positive impacts of the Resal effect, adversely affecting the shearing performance of the TSCWs. Furthermore, in three-span continuous girders and rigid frame girders exposed to localized fire, the shearing stress distribution in the fire-unaffected side spans shows an opposing trend, resulting from the influence of temperature-resistant moments at the supports. Finally, it reveals that while the temperature effect primarily influences the shearing stress distribution in simply supported girders, it simultaneously alters the shearing stress distribution and modifies the magnitude of the total shearing force in continuous girders and rigid frame girders. © 2025","Non-prismatic girders; Resal effect; Shearing performance; Trapezoidal Steel Corrugated Webs; Vehicle fire","ABAQUS; Aerodynamics; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Honeycomb structures; Rigid structures; Shear stress; Shearing; Steel beams and girders; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Structural frames; Continuous girders; Corrugated web; Non-prismatic; Non-prismatic girder; Resal effect; Shearing performance; Shearing stress; Stresses distribution; Trapezoidal steel corrugated web; Vehicle fires; Computational fluid dynamics","Zhang, Gang, Review and discussion on fire behavior of bridge girders, Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering (English Edition), 9, 3, pp. 422-446, (2022); Kodur, Venkatesh K.R., Fire hazard in concrete bridges: review, assessment and mitigation strategies, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 20, 10, pp. 1577-1594, (2024); Naser, M.

In the pursuit of innovative solutions, recent studies have explored the potential of 3D-printing technology to reinforce cementitious materials. However, challenges persist in optimizing this approach. This study investigates the reinforcement of cement beams using four distinct 3D-printed patterns: Honeycomb, 3D-Honeycomb, Grid, and Triangle. Each pattern was strategically positioned at varying distances from the neutral axis to assess its impact on the beam's flexural strength. The findings reveal that the Honeycomb pattern, when placed 10 mm from the bottom of the beam, enhanced flexural strength by over 25 %. The 3D-Honeycomb pattern, positioned at 5 mm, demonstrated similar improvements. Notably, the Grid pattern, also placed 5 mm from the bottom, resulted in a remarkable 46 % increase in flexural strength, while the Triangle pattern contributed to a 30 % enhancement. Further optimization was achieved by combining two reinforcement patterns. The Honeycomb pattern exhibited strain-hardening behavior and increased flexural strength by over 76 %. The 3D-Honeycomb and Grid patterns further augmented flexural strength by 76 % and 72 %, respectively. The most significant improvement was observed with the Grid pattern, which boosted flexural strength by more than 118 %. This study underscored the transformative potential of 3D-printed reinforcement in cement beams. The strategic use of Honeycomb, 3D-Honeycomb, Grid, and Triangle patterns not only enhances flexural strength but also induces strain-hardening behavior, leading to strength gains between 76 % and 118 % compared to the control sample. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of advanced construction materials and techniques. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","3D-Honeycomb; 3D-printed concrete; Grid; Honeycomb; Reinforced concrete; Triangle","Bending strength; Cements; Strain hardening; 3d-honeycomb; 3d-printed concrete; Grid; Grid pattern; Honeycomb; Honeycomb pattern; Optimisations; Reinforced concrete beams; Triangle; Triangle pattern; Concrete beams and girders","Struct Mech Eng Const Build, (2023); Ghasemi, Roohallah, Textile-reinforced mortars; an experimental comparative study of tensile strength improvement methods, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 236, 5, pp. 1094-1107, (2022); Ghasemi, Roohallah, Experimental and analytical study of flexural creep of impregnated woven fabric-reinforced concrete, Composite Structures, 321, (2023); Ghasemi, Roohallah, Micromechanical modeling and experimental study of the flexural properties of impregnated woven textile-reinforced concrete, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 238, 9, pp. 1791-1804, (2024); Panda, Biranchi Narayan, Measurement of tensile bond strength of 3D printed geopolymer mortar, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 113, pp. 108-116, (2018); Lafhaj, Zoubeir, Performance indicators of printed construction materials: A durability-based approach, Buildings, 9, 4, (2019); Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Autonomous and Robotic Construction of Infrastructure, (2015); Asprone, Domenico, Rethinking reinforcement for digital fabrication with concrete, Cement and Concrete Research, 112, pp. 111-121, (2018); Zhang, Lixin, Spectral data analysis based on bagging stochastic configuration networks, Infrared Physics and Technology, 143, (2024); Parmigiani, Silvia, 3D-printed multi-functional foamed concrete building components: Material properties, component design, and 3D printing application, Developments in the Built Environment, 20, (2024)",""

CLT panels (5-ply, 150 mm thick, 1 m wide, and 4.2 m long) made of larch (Larix kaempferi) and pine (Pinus densiflora) were manufactured with 30 mm thick laminae, considering three types of joints. Three CLT panels of the same species and joint type were connected using spline joints, butt joints, or half-lap joints to form 3 m wide and 4.2 m long slabs for testing. The floor impact sound insulation performance of the CLT slabs was measured according to KS F ISO 10140-3, using the standard heavy-weight impact source, a rubber ball. Additionally, four accelerometers were installed at 400 mm intervals beneath the CLT slabs to analyze the deflections and natural frequencies of the slabs. The results of the experiment indicated that there were no significant differences depending on the wood species and the CLT panel joints.

By leveraging the unique properties of these biobased materials within a corrugated geometry, the research presents a novel approach to enhancing the structural performance of such underutilized biobased materials. These biobased materials were used in different lengths to consider the manufacturing feasibility of corrugated panels and the effect of fiber length on their structural performance. The average lengths for wood strands and wheat straws were 12–15 cm and 3–7.5 cm, respectively, while rice husks were like particles, about 7 mm long. Due to the high silica content in rice husk and wheat straw, which negatively impacts the bonding performance, polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI), an effective adhesive for such materials, was used for the fabrication of corrugated panels. Wood strands and phenol formaldehyde (PF) adhesive were used to fabricate flat outer layers. Flat panels were bonded to both sides of the corrugated panels using a polyurethane adhesive to develop corrugated core sandwich panels. Four-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate the panel’s bending stiffness, load-carrying capacity, and failure modes. Results demonstrated that sandwich panels with wood strand corrugated cores exhibited the highest bending stiffness and load-bearing capacity, while those with wheat straw corrugated cores performed similarly. Rice husk corrugated core sandwich panels showed the lowest mechanical performance compared to other sandwich panels. Considering the applications of these sandwich panels as floor, wall, and roof sheathing, all these panels exhibited superior bending performance compared to 11.2 mm- and 17.42 mm-thick commercial OSB (oriented strand board) panels, which are commonly used as building materials. These sandwich structures supported a longer span than commercial OSB panels while satisfying the deflection limit of L/360. The findings suggest the transformative potential of converting renewable yet underutilized materials into an engineered concept, corrugated geometry, leading to the development of high-performance, carbon-negative building materials suitable for flooring and roof applications. © 2024 by the authors.","bending performance; biobased materials; crop residues; experimental testing; flooring; rice husks; sheathing; small-diameter trees; wheat straws; wood strands","Bending tests; Compressive strength; Concretes; Corrugated materials; Gluing; Hemp; Honeycomb structures; Mortar; Particle board; Roof coverings; Sandwich structures; Straw; Timber; Bending performance; Bio-based materials; Crop residue; Experimental testing; Flooring; Rice husk; Sheathing; Small-diameter tree; Wheat straws; Wood strands; Floors","Strad Res, (2022); Kong, Xiangbing Bin, Editorial: Agricultural land and environmental risks: evidences, assessment and conservation transition, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 12, (2024); Blümmel, Michael, Recent Advances in Dual Purpose Rice and Wheat Research: a synthesis, Field Crops Research, 253, (2020); Muthayya, Sumithra, An overview of global rice production, supply, trade, and consumption, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1324, 1, pp. 7-14, (2014); Journal of Food Distribution Research, (2004); Enhancing Wheat Productiona Global Perspective, (2015); Kordi, Masoumeh, Rice Husk at a Glance: From Agro-Industrial to Modern Applications, Rice Science, 31, 1, pp. 14-32, (2024); Jittin, V., Utilisation of rice husk ash for cleaner production of different construction products, Journal of Cleaner Production, 263, (2020); Das, Shaswat Kumar, Production, characteristics, and utilization of rice husk ash in alkali activated materials: An overview of fresh and hardened state properties, Construction and Building Materials, 345, (2022); Matin, Hashfi Hawali Abdul, Rice Husk Waste: Impact on Environmental Health and Potential as Biogas, Kemas, 18, 3, pp. 431-436, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

The surface analysis conducted using three-dimensional modeling tools provided information about the formation of its microstructure before and after the application of a reflection-smoothing coating, which has a direct impact on the emissivity of the surface and was reduced from 0.93 to 0.29. Thermal analyses demonstrated that after applying the reflective coating, thermal resistance increased significantly in the air gap, by approximately 86%, which resulted in a 28% improvement of the evaluated walls samples. The studies have shown that increasing the gap thickness between concrete and thermal insulation results in a thermal resistance increase. It is feasible to enhance the thermal insulation of walls while simultaneously reducing their thickness, a development that holds significant potential for application in the production of prefabricated sandwich panels.

Through monotonic loading bending tests on six full-size specimens, aspects such as their failure modes, load-deflection curves, load-strain relationships, slip between the thermal insulation layer and concrete, and composite action were analyzed. The results show that all sandwich wall panels experienced bending and ductile failure, and exhibit partial composite performance, with P4 having the best composite performance and P1 the worst. The degree of composite action is positively correlated with the flexural bearing capacity. The bending capacity mainly depends on the layout rather than the total number of SGCCs. Arranging connectors along the short side of the panel has a more significant impact, and the number of connectors at the panel’s ends has a greater influence on the composite performance. Except for P1, the theoretical value of the composite degree of the other sandwich wall panels exceeds 70%, and P4 reaches 85%. The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results.

In order to improve the sound absorption performance of Micro-perforated plate Diamond sandwich structure (MPP-DSS) at low frequency, a microperforated sandwich-polyurethane composite structure based on TPMS was proposed. The microperforation sandwich and polyurethane composite structure was prepared by freeze-drying method by filling polyurethane sound absorbent material in MPP-DSS. The sound absorption theoretical model of TPMS microperforated sandwich and polyurethane composite structure was established by transfer matrix method. The sound absorption properties of microperforated sandwich structures before and after polyurethane filling were studied. The results show that the TPMS micro-perforated sandwich layer filled with polyurethane strong sound absorption material can broaden the relative sound absorption bandwidth in the middle and low frequency band, make the peak sound absorption frequency move to the low frequency direction of 294 Hz, and widen the relative sound absorption bandwidth by 23.86%. The sound absorption performance of the low frequency band is mainly determined by the TPMS micro-perforation resonance sound absorption structure, and the sound absorption performance of the higher frequency band is mainly determined by the polyurethane strong sound absorption material, which has certain reference significance for how to design the lightweight high-strength middle-low frequency broadband sound absorption structure. © 2024 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Composite structure; Polyurethane sound absorbing material; Sound absorption performance; Triply periodic minimal surfaces","Building materials; Concrete buildings; Honeycomb structures; Light absorption; Low temperature drying; Perforated plates; Religious buildings; Sound insulating materials; Absorption performance; Composites structures; Lower frequencies; Microperforated; Polyurethane composites; Polyurethane sound absorbing material; Sound absorbing materials; Sound absorption; Sound absorption performance; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Sandwich structures","Yellur, Manoja Rao, A low velocity impact study on press formed thermoplastic honeycomb sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 225, (2019); Yu, Sheng, The impact resistance of composite Y-shaped cores sandwich structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 169, (2021); Lin, Qinhao, Sound insulation performance of sandwich structure compounded with a resonant acoustic metamaterial, Composite Structures, 273, (2021); Tang, Yufan, Sound absorption of micro-perforated sandwich panel with honeycomb-corrugation hybrid core at high temperatures, Composite Structures, 226, (2019); Gürgen, Selim, Vibration attenuation of sandwich structures filled with shear thickening fluids, Composites Part B: Engineering, 186, (2020); Ma, Yuan, Flow and thermal performance of sandwich panels with plate fins or/and pyramidal lattice, Applied Thermal Engineering, 164, (2020); Sun, Shanyouming You Ming, Forced convection in additively manufactured sandwich-walled cylinders with thermo-mechanical multifunctionality, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 149, (2020); Qiu, Na, Mechanical performance of triply periodic minimal surface structures with a novel hybrid gradient fabricated by selective laser melting, Engineering Structures, 263, (2022); Sun, Qidong, Compressive mechanical properties and energy absorption characteristics of SLM fabricated Ti6Al4V triply periodic minimal surface cellular structures, Mechanics of Materials, 166, (2022); Zhang, Cong, Mechanical responses of sheet-based gyroid-type triply periodic minimal surface lattice structures fabricated using selective laser melting, Materials and Design, 214, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

However, there are few studies on the glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) ultra-long two-way (UT) connector of ultra-low energy-consumption PCSW. In this paper, two types of new GFRP UT connectors with different cross-sectional forms were proposed, and the effects of insulation layer thickness, connector cross-sectional form, and insulation layer materials on the failure mode, stiffness, peak bearing strength, and shear load slip relationship of the specimens were studied by in-plane direct shear tests. The test results show that with the increase of insulation layer thickness, the failure mode of test specimens gradually changes from failure of connectors to anchorage failure of concrete, and the initial stiffness and peak bearing strength of connectors decrease significantly; Under the condition of the same thickness of the insulation layer, the shear performance of the GFRP square tube cross-section UT ( SUT) connector specimen is better than that of the GFRP circular tube cross-section UT ( CUT) connector specimen; The insulation layer material has a certain contribution to the peak bearing strength and initial stiffness of the connector, but the impact is small, and it is recommended to be used as a safety reserve. Subsequently, the finite element (FE) model of the specimen was established by ABAQUS software, and validation and extension analysis were carried out based on the test results. Finally, based on the test and FE model results, the shear bearing strength prediction equations and load slip model of GFRP UT connectors were established, which have good accuracy. © 2024 Institution of Structural Engineers","GFRP; In-plane direct shear test; Insulation connector; Insulation layer; Precast concrete sandwich wall","ABAQUS; Anchorages (concrete construction); Elastomers; Fiber reinforced concrete; Fracture mechanics; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; High modulus textile fibers; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Sandwich structures; Shear strength; Shear stress; Shear walls; Silicones; Slip forming; Bearing strengths; Direct shear test; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); In-plane direct shear test; Insulation connector; Insulation layers; Pre-cast; Precast concrete sandwich wall; Two ways; Ultra longs; Precast concrete","Faria Oliveira, Thainá, Precast concrete sandwich panels (PCSP): An analytical review and evaluation of CO2 equivalent, Construction and Building Materials, 358, (2022); Environ Sci Pollut Res, (2024); PCI J, (2020); Tomlinson, Douglas G., Analysis and Parametric Study of Partially Composite Precast Concrete Sandwich Panels under Axial Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 142, 10, (2016); Tomlinson, Douglas G., Combined Loading behavior of basalt frp-reinforced precast concrete insulated partially-composite walls, Journal of Composites for Construction, 20, 3, (2016); PCI J, (2020); Jawdhari, Akram R., Thermal-Structural Analysis and Thermal Bowing of Double Wythe UHPC Insulated Walls, Energy and Buildings, 223, (2020); Qiang, Guo, Study on the performance of an ultra-low energy building in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, Journal of Building Engineering, 70, (2023); Zhang, Donglin, Towards ultra-low energy consumption buildings: Implementation path strategy based on practical effects in China, Energy for Sustainable Development, 70, pp. 537-548, (2022); Zhang, Tongsheng, UHPC-XPS insulation composite board reinforced by glass fiber mesh: Effect of structural design on the heat transfer, mechanical properties and impact resistance, Journal of Building Engineering, 75, (2023)",""

In the design of such panels, most design methods treat blast and fragment loading independently for far-field explosions. However, the synergistic effects of combined blast and fragments loading should be accounted for in close-in explosion scenarios. In this study, a field test program was conducted to assess the damage of the steel-concrete composite panels subjected to close-in explosion of cased charges at various scaled distance between 0.39 and 0.78 m/kg1/3. Characterization test of cased charge detonation was performed to explore the combined loading effect. The analysis includes the pressure-time history from the cased charge detonation, distribution of the fragment masses and velocities over the test panels. The structural damage and response of the composite panels against the combined loading effects was measured. The results indicated that in addition to the damage from the blast wave, the panel was remarkably damaged by the fragment impact. Despite the significant structural damage, the panels maintained its structural integrity after the tests. Additionally, quasi-static load tests were conducted on the panels to quantify their load resistant differences in pristine condition and various damaged conditions due to the explosive effects. © 2024","Cased charge; Combined blast and fragment; Steel-concrete composite panels","Concrete slabs; Explosions; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural analysis; Cased charge; Charge detonation; Combined blast and fragment; Combined loading; Composite panels; Loading effects; Steel-concrete composite; Steel-concrete composite panel; Structural damages; Structural response; Detonation","Lan, Shengrui, Composite structural panels subjected to explosive loading, Construction and Building Materials, 19, 5, pp. 387-395, (2005); Richard Liew, J.

This paper investigates the energy absorption process in large crash boxes applied onto a road maintenance vehicle, exploring four aluminium honeycomb absorbers with design factors like added aluminium foam, corrugated sheet thicknesses, and stiffener reinforcements. The optimised foam-filled honeycomb structures are analysed for four crash scenarios in two different directions; frontal impact (T-direction) and lateral impact (L-direction) subjected to 50 km/h crash speed. The objective of this research is to identify the most efficient design that achieves a maximum acceleration of up to 20g while absorbing a specific energy of 145 kJ. The FE models were developed in ABAQUS to explore various scenarios related to damage zones, impact energy capabilities, and multi-foam-filled crash boxes.

The fact that pervious paving has holes in it that let water seep through to the underlying materials underneath is one of its key features. Additionally, it lessens water pollution and peak stormwater flow while encouraging groundwater recharging. The primary goal of this study is to replace cement with GGBS, which makes it environmentally friendly, while also aiming to strike the ideal balance between strength and permeability. Utilizing a by-product like GGBS is a sustainable construction practices, which results in lower CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. In this paper, 10%, 20%, and 30% of GGBS have been replaced to cement. HDPE plastic fiber with length 18 ± 2 mm, which is obtained from the used HDPE cement bags, is used as a reinforcing material. Different proportion of plastic fibers 1%, 1.5%, and 2% was added in pervious concrete trial. The specimens were casted and examinations like the compressive strength test, infiltration test, flexure strength test, and impact test were conducted to determine its mechanical properties. When GGBS was optimized, the mechanical properties of pervious concrete were boosted. Based on the test results, the optimum dosages for GGBS are 20%. Compressive strength was 23.44% more than in the control group. Adding 1.5% HDPE fiber was the most beneficial to improve the flexure properties. It is 41.68% greater than control mix, but infiltration rate decreases with increase in fibers. Considering 1.5% HDPE fiber-reinforced concrete to ordinary concrete, it was found that the impact strength increased to more than 100% for the first fracture and 85.52% for the final failure, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the mix GH-7 (20% GGBS with 1.5% HDPE fiber) has better compressive strength, flexural strength, and impact strength, and thus can be utilized as a paving material. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Environment friendly; GGBS; HDPE plastic bag strips; Paving material; Sustainable construction practices","","Lee, Ming Gin, Abrasion and Maintenance of High-Strength Fiber-Reinforced Pervious Concrete, Buildings, 14, 1, (2024); Brasileiro, Kelly Patrícia Torres Vieira, Influence of recycled aggregates and silica fume on the performance of pervious concrete, Journal of Building Engineering, 82, (2024); Deepa, K., Experimental research on pervious concrete performance with partial replacement of foundry sand nano and GGBS, Materials Today: Proceedings, 103, pp. 22-31, (2024); El-Hassan, Hilal, Synergic effect of recycled aggregates, waste glass, and slag on the properties of pervious concrete, Developments in the Built Environment, 15, (2023); Ferić, Kajo, Effect of Aggregate Size and Compaction on the Strength and Hydraulic Properties of Pervious Concrete, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023); Lee, Ming Gin, Mechanical Properties of High-Strength Pervious Concrete with Steel Fiber or Glass Fiber, Buildings, 12, 5, (2022); Lin, Kaelong, Application of ternary cementless hybrid binders for pervious concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 346, (2022); Mitrosz, Oskar, Influence of the Addition of Recycled Aggregates and Polymer Fibers on the Properties of Pervious Concrete, Materials, 16, 15, (2023); Oinam, Yanchen, Characteristics of GGBFS-Based Pervious Concrete Considering Rheological Properties of the Binder, International Journal of Concrete Structures and Materials, 16, 1, (2022); Pradhan, Sujit Kumar, Performance assessment of pervious concrete road on strength and permeability by using silica fume, Materials Today: Proceedings, 60, pp. 559-568, (2022)",""

According to the prototype structure of the pier, a batch of scale models with a scaling factor of 1:10 was produced. The BHTS buffer interlayer was installed on the reinforced concrete (RC) column specimen to carry out the steel ball impact test. Then, the modified numerical model was subjected to the low-energy input impact test of the steel ball without energy loss during the falling process at the equivalent height of 1.0–3.5 m, and the dynamic response characteristics of the RC column were analyzed. By comparing the impact force and impact duration, maximum displacement, and residual displacement in the impact model, the BHTS buffer interlayer’s protective effect on RC columns under lower energy lateral impact was evaluated. Later, a high-energy input lateral impact test of a steel ball falling at an equivalent height of 20.0 m was carried out. According to the material damage, dynamic response, and energy absorption characteristics in the impact model, the failure process of the RC columns was analyzed. The results showed that BHTS absorbed 82.33% of the impact kinetic energy and reduced 77.27% of the impact force, 86.51% of the inertia force, and 64.86% of the base shear force under the failure mode of a 20 m impact condition. It can transform the shear failure of the RC column into bending failure and play an effective protective role for the RC column.

Therefore, To improve the overall stress state of such structures and increase their load-bearing capacity, this study introduces an innovative design for Steel-pipe PBL shear connectors(Perfobond rib shear connectors). In this design, steel pipes are welded to the openings of conventional PBL shear connectors. By utilizing the circular cross-section of the steel pipe to resist the complex stresses at the material interfaces, the stiffness of the shear connectors and the load-bearing capacity of the structure are improved at the same time. This study evaluates the shear performance of the new PBL shear connectors by testing nine specimens with varying parameters: steel pipe diameter, length, wall thickness, perforated rebar diameter, and concrete strength.

Detailed three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of twenty-three full-scale columns subjected to rigid vehicle impact are established and simulated, including twenty GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST columns, one GFRP-normal strength concrete (NSC)-encased CFDST column, one GFRP bar reinforced UHPC (GFRP-UHPC) column, and one steel bar reinforced UHPC (steel-UHPC) column. The models incorporate the strain rate effects of GFRP, steel, and concrete materials, as well as the effects of concrete confinement provided by the steel tubes and stirrups. The accuracy of the numerical models is validated against test results. A full-range analysis of the dynamic response of the GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST column, GFRP-NSC-encased CFDST column, GFRP-UHPC column, and steel-UHPC column is conducted and discussed in detail. Furthermore, the impact resistance contributions of each component of the columns are analyzed and explored. The impact resistance of the GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST column surpasses that of the GFRP-NSC-encased CFDST column, the GFRP-UHPC column, and the steel-UHPC column, demonstrating promising cooperation between its components. Finally, parametric studies are conducted to examine the influence of impact velocity and key geometric parameters on the dynamic behavior of GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST columns. The impact velocity, the ratio of the outer steel tube diameter to the total column diameter (d<inf>o</inf>/D), the ratio of the inner steel tube diameter to the total column diameter (d<inf>i</inf>/D), and the thickness of the outer steel tube significantly influence the lateral impact behavior of GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST columns, while the effect of the inner steel tube thickness is negligible. © 2024 Institution of Structural Engineers","Dynamic behavior; GFRP-UHPC-encased CFDST column; Lateral impact loading; Nonlinear finite element model; Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC)","Columns (structural); Composite beams and girders; Concrete bridges; Dynamic response; Elastomers; Fiber reinforced concrete; Foundations; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Glass fibers; Honeycomb structures; Hydraulic structures; Pressure vessels; Silicones; Steel bridges; Thermoplastics; Towers; Tubular steel structures; Concrete-encased; Dynamic behaviors; Glass fiber-reinforced polymer-ultra-high-performance concrete-encased CFDST column; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); High-performance concrete; Impact loadings; Lateral impact; Lateral impact loading; Non-linear finite element modeling; Ultra high performance; Ultra-high-performance concrete; Ultra-high performance concrete","Ma, Youxin, Experimental and numerical studies of concrete-encased concrete-filled steel tube stub columns under uniaxial and biaxial eccentric compression, Engineering Structures, 232, (2021); Zhou, Xiaoguang, Structural mechanism-based intelligent capacity prediction methods for concrete-encased CFST columns, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 202, (2023); Hu, Changming, Concrete-encased CFST members with circular sections under laterally low velocity impact: Analytical behaviour, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 146, pp. 135-154, (2018); Huang, Hong, Analytical behaviour of concrete-filled double skin steel tubular (CFDST) stub columns, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 66, 4, pp. 542-555, (2010); Wang, Rui, Analytical behavior of concrete filled double steel tubular (CFDST) members under lateral impact, Thin-Walled Structures, 101, pp. 129-140, (2016); Zhao, Hui, Performance of circular CFDST members with external stainless steel tube under transverse impact loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 145, (2019); Li, Minglun, Flexural behavior of square concrete-encased concrete-filled double-skin steel tube members, Structures, 60, (2024); Ding, Ji'nan, Axial compressive performance of square concrete-encased concrete-filled double-skin steel tube stub columns, Engineering Structures, 276, (2023); Ayough, Pouria, Numerical investigation and design of UHPC-encased CFST stub columns under axial compression, Engineering Structures, 302, (2024); Cai, Jingming, Behavior of ECC-encased CFST columns under axial compression, Engineering Structures, 171, pp. 1-9, (2018)",""

According to the dynamic response, energy absorption characteristics, and other indicators, the impact protection effectiveness of the UHPC-BHTS composite structure on six RC column specimens with different equivalent heights from 1 to 3.5 m was evaluated.

Existing design methods are unable to accurately quantify either the composite action between the inner and outer wythes or fully consider the complex design parameters when predicting the flexural performance of this new type of sandwich panel. In response, two normal concrete sandwich panels (NSPs) and two ESPs were first tested to reveal their flexural performance using a four-point bending test. Test results indicate that the application of ECC to the outer wythe can significantly improve the flexural performance of the sandwich panel, especially in terms of crack resistance and ductility. Subsequently, finite element parametric analysis demonstrated the impact of connector arrangement on the flexural performance, and design formulas for the degree of composite action (DCA) based on connector arrangement were proposed. Finally, a data-driven prediction model integrating experiments, finite element analysis, and neural networks was developed to accurately predict the flexural carrying capacity and ductility of the sandwich panel.

However, the thermal and energy performance of 3D-printed buildings remains underexplored, particularly regarding the interactions between geometric design, material selection, and printing parameters. This review addresses this gap by critically examining how the main steps of the printing process impact the thermal efficiency of 3D-printed buildings. Key findings indicate that material development needs to focus on mixes that balance thermal properties, printability, and structural integrity. The review demonstrates how optimising wall cross-sections and cavity shapes can reduce thermal conductivity and enhance energy efficiency. Innovative geometric designs, such as cellular and honeycomb structures, have shown improvements in thermal insulation. Optimising printing parameters, such as extrusion rate and nozzle travel speed, is crucial to minimising thermal bridges and reducing material anisotropy. Advanced numerical models, validated by experimental data and incorporating factors like inhomogeneous porosity, anisotropy, and surface roughness, are essential for accurately predicting the thermal behaviour of 3D-printed structures. The review underscores the need for large-scale, long-term performance studies of 3D-printed buildings under diverse climatic conditions. Additionally, developing standardised fabrication protocols and testing methods is essential for ensuring consistent quality and broader adoption.

Subsequently, a shaking table test was carried out to investigate the damage pattern, dynamic characteristics and dynamic responses of a full-scale structure. The test results demonstrated that the overall damage was moderate, which exerted a few impacts on the structural capacity or integrity. The global responses, including small displacement response, minor torsion response, and high energy dissipation capacity were found, as well as local responses, such as small strains in the steel plates and a slight loss of bolt prestress.

A series of drop weight impact tests were conducted on sandwich structures comprising polyurethane foam, aluminum, and concrete. The investigation encompasses variations in the thickness of the polyurethane foam-aluminum absorption layer, the impact height, and different structural combinations, coupled with numerical simulations. Results indicate that as the thickness of the polyurethane foam-aluminum energy absorption layer increases, the energy absorbed by the composite structure also increases. However, the rate of this increase tapers off as the layer thickness continues to grow. The impact height influences energy absorption within a defined range, enabling optimal utilization of the deformation and energy absorption capacities of the polyurethane foam-aluminum layer. Notably, the double-sandwich structure outperforms the single-sandwich structure in terms of impact resistance. The incorporation of the polyurethane foam-aluminum sandwich structure significantly enhances the impact resilience of concrete. Among the tested configurations, the double-sandwich structure composed of polyurethane foam, aluminum, and concrete exhibits the optimal absorption performance. Nevertheless, the layered nature of the structure significantly increases its construction complexity, potentially impacting the practical feasibility of utilizing the polyurethane foam-aluminum-concrete composite structure in real-world applications. © 2024 by the authors.","concrete; impact test; numerical simulation; polyurethane foam-aluminum; sandwich structure","Composite structures; Convergence of numerical methods; Honeycomb structures; Rigid foamed plastics; Structural optimization; Absorption layer; Composites structures; Energy; Foam aluminium; Foam aluminum; Foam concretes; Impact test; Polyurethane concretes; Polyurethane Foam; Polyurethane foam-aluminum; Sandwich structures","Izadifar, Mohammadreza, Theoretical Elastic Constants of Tobermorite Enhanced with Reduced Graphene Oxide through Hydroxyl vs Epoxy Functionalization: A First-Principles Study, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 127, 36, pp. 18117-18126, (2023); Sharifi Ghalehnoei, Mohammadsina, Finite Element Analysis of Shear Reinforcing of Reinforced Concrete Beams with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Grid-Strengthened Engineering Cementitious Composite, Buildings, 13, 4, (2023); Ul Haq, Inzimam, Mechanical and durability performance of concrete mixtures incorporating bentonite, silica fume, and polypropylene fibers, Construction and Building Materials, 345, (2022); Rodsin, Kittipoom, Behavior of steel clamp confined brick aggregate concrete circular columns subjected to axial compression, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 16, (2022); Joyklad, Panuwat, Effect of fired clay brick aggregates on mechanical properties of concrete, Suranaree Journal of Science and Technology, 25, 4, pp. 349-362, (2018); Merrett, Robert P., The blast and impact loading of aluminium foam, Materials and Design, 44, pp. 311-319, (2013); Cheng, Yuansheng, Damage Response Characteristics of UHMWPE/aluminum Foam Composite Sandwich Panel Subjected to Combined Blast and Fragment Loadings, Binggong Xuebao/Acta Armamentarii, 42, 8, pp. 1753-1762, (2021); Karagiozova, Dora, Propagation of compaction waves in metal foams exhibiting strain hardening, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 49, 19-20, pp. 2763-2777, (2012); Zheng, Zhijun, Dynamic crushing of cellular materials: Continuum-based wave models for the transitional and shock modes, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 42, pp. 66-79, (2012); Liao, Shenfei, Dynamic crushing of 2D cellular structures: Local strain field and shock wave velocity, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 57, pp. 7-16, (2013)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Hollow steel tubes are commonly used to produce bollards; however, their impact resistance and energy absorption are limited. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of honeycomb and auxetic cellular cores can improve the energy absorption and protection level of existing bollards. Hollow bollard, a honeycomb–core bollard and an auxetic-core bollard were numerically modeled and tested (using Simulia Abaqus software, version 2019) against the impact of M1-class vehicles (of 1500 kg mass) at five different speeds (following PAS 68:2013 British standard). Hence, 15 cases/numerical models were considered, with 5 cases for each bollard type. The results revealed that the addition of an auxetic cellular core to the bollard system could increase its energy dissipation by 52% compared to the hollow steel bollard. Moreover, the proposed auxetic anti-ram bollard system was capable of stopping an M1-class vehicular impact of 64 km/h compared to only 32 km/h when using a hollow steel bollard. To the authors’ knowledge, the use of an auxetic core, explicitly for anti-ram bollards, can be considered the novel part of this research. © 2024 by the authors.","Abaqus; anti-ram bollard; finite element model; honeycomb; impact; protective structures; re-entrant auxetic; structural dynamics","Concretes; Highway accidents; Honeycomb structures; Pedestrian safety; Pressure vessels; Tubular steel structures; Abaqus; Anti-ram bollard; Auxetics; Cellulars; Finite element modelling (FEM); Hollow steel; Honeycomb; Impact; Protective structures; Re-entrant auxetic; ABAQUS","Road Traffic Injuries, (2025); Ahmed, Sirwan Khalid, Road traffic accidental injuries and deaths: A neglected global health issue, Health Science Reports, 6, 5, (2023); Hu, Bo, Numerical investigation of K4-rating shallow footing fixed anti-ram bollard system subjected to vehicle impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 63, pp. 72-87, (2014); Impact and Energy Absorption of Straight and Tapered Rectangular Tubes, (2005); Maduliat, Soheila, Performance of hollow steel tube bollards under quasi-static and lateral impact load, Thin-Walled Structures, 88, pp. 41-47, (2015); Maduliat, Soheila, Energy absorption of steel hollow tubes under bending, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Structures and Buildings, 168, 12, pp. 930-942, (2015); Security and Resiliencevehicle Security Barriers Part 1 Performance Requirement Vehicle Impact Test Method and Performance Rating, (2023); Impact Test Specifications for Vehicle Security Barrier Systems, (2013); ASTM F2656m 20 Standard Test Method for Crash Testing of Vehicle Security Barriers, (2020); Al-Rifaie, Hasan, A new blast absorbing sandwich panel with unconnected corrugated layers—numerical study, Energies, 14, 1, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

A series of impact tests were conducted on one reinforced concrete beam and five beams with a protective layer, focusing on their dynamic responses and failure patterns. Test parameters included the type of protective layers (unprotected, aluminium foam and sandwich panel) and impact energy. Test results showed that the aluminium foam and sandwich panel could effectively protect the reinforced concrete beam from severe damage under impact loadings and converted the failure pattern of beams from shear failure to flexure-shear failure. Compared with the unprotected beam, the beams with a protective layer exhibited a lower peak force and developed a smaller mid-span deformation. Besides, the protective effects of the aluminium foam and sandwich panel were found to be nearly the same. Moreover, the peak force, plateau force and deformation of the beams were increased with the increasing impact energy. A numerical model was developed to investigate the energy distribution of beams with a sandwich panel protective layer. Based on the validated model, the effects of longitudinal reinforcement ratio and shear-span ratio on the impact response of beams were further studied. It was found that the deformation of beams increased significantly with the increasing shear-span ratio, whereas an increase in the longitudinal reinforcement ratio led to a decreased deformation. This study provides an important reference for designing reinforced concrete beams with a sandwich panel protective layer to resist impact loads. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminium foam sandwich panel; Energy absorption capacity; Impact response; Numerical simulation; Reinforced concrete beam","Aluminum; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Honeycomb structures; Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Shear flow; Aluminium foam; Aluminium foam sandwich panels; Energy absorption capacity; Failure patterns; Impact energy; Impact loadings; Impact response; Protective layers; Reinforced concrete beams; Sandwich panel; Numerical models; computer simulation; experimental study; numerical model; reinforced concrete; response analysis; structural component; structural response","Zhang, Jingfeng, A comprehensive approach for bridge performance evaluation under rockfall impact integrated with geological hazard analysis, Engineering Failure Analysis, 141, (2022); Li, Ruiwen, Vehicular impact resistance of seismic designed RC bridge piers, Engineering Structures, 220, (2020); Ožbolt, Joško, Numerical simulation of reinforced concrete beams with different shear reinforcements under dynamic impact loads, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 38, 12, pp. 940-950, (2011); Gao, Shan, Experimental and numerical studies on deformation performance of square concrete-filled steel tubular columns under repeated lateral impacts, Engineering Structures, 308, (2024); Li, Huawei, Influence of drop weight geometry and interlayer on impact behavior of RC beams, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 131, pp. 222-237, (2019); Zhao, Debo, Shear Mechanisms in Reinforced Concrete Beams under Impact Loading, Journal of Structural Engineering, 143, 9, (2017); Fujikake, Kazunori, Impact response of reinforced concrete beam and its analytical evaluation, Journal of Structural Engineering, 135, 8, pp. 938-950, (2009); Kishi, Norimitsu, Impact behavior of shear-failure-type RC beams without shear rebar, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 27, 9, pp. 955-968, (2002); Pham, Thong M., Sensitivity of impact behaviour of RC beams to contact stiffness, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 112, pp. 155-164, (2018); Pham, Thong M., Influence of global stiffness and equivalent model on prediction of impact response of RC beams, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 113, pp. 88-97, (2018)",""

On the basis of a modified rigid-plastic material model, the analytical solutions for the maximum deflection and the structural response time of FML sandwich beams with metal foam core are obtained. Finite element analysis is carried out by using ABAQUS software, and the numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions effectively. The study further examines the impact of the metal volume fraction, the metal strength factor between the metal layer and the composite material layer, the foam strength factor of the metal foam core to the composite material layer, and the foam density factor on the structural response. Findings reveal that these parameters influence the dynamic response of fiber–metal laminate (FML) sandwich beams to varying degrees. The developed analytical model demonstrates its capability to accurately forecast the dynamic behavior of fiber–metal laminate (FML) sandwich beams under uniform blast loading. The theoretical model in this article is a simplified model and cannot consider details such as damage, debonding, and the influence of layer angles in experiments.

Compared with existing experimental data, the validity of the finite element modeling method was verified. Parameter analysis was conducted on 36 full-scale STHHCs to obtain the hysteresis curve of the composite columns and to clarify the impact of the different parameters on the skeleton curve, the energy dissipation capacity, the stiffness degradation, and the ductility of the composite columns. The results showed that the hysteresis curves of all specimens after freeze-thaw cycles exhibited an ideal shuttle shape, reflecting that this kind of composite column has good energy dissipation ability and freeze-thaw resistance. The specimens’ maximum bulging deformation and maximum stress both occurred at the column base.

A total of twelve composite sandwich wall panels are prepared, utilizing modified polystyrene particles mixed with foam concrete for the flexural performance test. The failure pattern of the composite sandwich wall panels is influenced by the extruded polystyrene panel (XPS) panel thickness and the reinforcement ratio in combination, resulting in both flexural and shear failure modes. Increasing the XPS panel thickness causes the specimens to transition from flexural failure to shear failure. An increase in the reinforcement ratio leads to the transition from flexural failure to shear failure. The hole form on the XPS panel and the steel bar arrangement form affect the loading behavior of the specimens. Plum-arrangement hole form specimens exhibit lower steel bar strain and deflection compared to linear-arrangement hole form specimens. Additionally, specimens with concealed beam-type steel bar display lower steel bar strain and deflection than uniform-type steel bar specimens. However, the hole form and steel bar arrangement form have a limited impact on the ultimate load. Theoretical formulas for cracking load are provided for both fully composite and non-composite states. When compared to the experimental values, it is observed that the cracking load of the specimens with XPS panels closely matches the calculations for the non-composite state. An accurate prediction model for the ultimate load of fully composite wall panels is developed.

Two types of panels were developed: (i) an all-composite sandwich panel, made of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) face sheets and webs, and polyurethane (PUR) foam; (ii) and a hybrid sandwich panel, where the top face sheet comprises a thin layer of concrete. The study included the comparative analysis of the airborne sound reduction and impact sound pressure level of both types of panels based on experimental tests on full-scale specimens, including a typical floor covering. The acoustic insulation properties determined experimentally were compared with predictions from different analytical models typically applied to sandwich panels, and also with performance requirements defined in building regulation. Among the different analytical models that were assessed, Sharp's model provided the most accurate predictions when considering the natural and dilatation frequencies as the critical frequency. The comparison of the normalized airborne and impact sound indices determined experimentally with requirements set in building regulation shows that the use of GFRP-PUR panels in the rehabilitation of lightweight timber floors and in new construction, where building comfort requirements are stricter, require mitigation measures to improve sound insulation. © 2024 The Authors","Airborne sound reduction; Glass fibre reinforced polymer; Impact sound pressure level; Polyurethane foam core; Sandwich panels","Acoustic wave transmission; Analytical models; Fiber reinforced plastics; Floors; Honeycomb structures; Polyurethanes; Rigid foamed plastics; Sandwich structures; Timber; Airborne sound; Airborne sound reduction; Composite sandwich panels; Foam core; Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP); Impact sound pressure levels; Polyurethane Foam; Polyurethane foam core; Sandwich panel; Sound reduction; Sound insulation","Lightweight Sandwich Construction, (2001); Handbook of Sandwich Construction, (1997); Birman, Victor M., Review of current trends in research and applications of sandwich structures, Composites Part B: Engineering, 142, pp. 221-240, (2018); Proceedings 19th Annual International Bridge Conference, (2002); undefined, (2004); Harris, Devin K., Field investigation of a sandwich plate system bridge deck, Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, 22, 5, pp. 305-315, (2008); undefined, (2009); undefined, (2011); Teixeira de Freitas, Sofia, Sandwich system for renovation of orthotropic steel bridge decks, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 13, 3, pp. 279-301, (2011); Ramôa Correia, João Ramôa, GFRP sandwich panels with PU foam and PP honeycomb cores for civil engineering structural applications: Effects of introducing strengthening ribs, International Journal of Structural Integrity, 3, 2, pp. 127-147, (2012)","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The finite element models of STHHC composite columns were simulated using ABAQUS finite element software (Version: 2021). The modeling method’s rationality was verified by comparing simulation results with experimental outcomes. Based on the finite element model, a parametric analysis of the composite columns under freeze–thaw cycles was conducted, analyzing their failure modes and load-bearing processes. The results indicate that the bearing capacity of the STHHC increased with increases in ξ and f<inf>cu</inf>, and decreased with a rise in λ. In contrast, the influence of s/h<inf>w</inf> and d/h<inf>w</inf> on the ultimate bearing capacity of the composite columns was relatively minor. An equation for calculating the axial bearing capacity of the STHHC composite columns under freeze–thaw cycles was derived using statistical regression methods and considering the impact of different parameters on the axial compressive performance of the composite columns, laying the foundation for the promotion and application of this type of composite column in practical engineering projects. © 2024 by the authors.","axial compression behavior; bearing capacity; composite columns; composite columns; finite element modeling; freeze–thaw cycles","Axial compression; Columns (structural); Composite structures; Concretes; Honeycomb structures; Thawing; Tubular steel structures; Axial compression behavior; Composite column; Concretefilled steel tubes (CFST); Element models; Finite element modeling; Freeze-thaw cycles; Height ratio; High strength concretes; Steel webs; ABAQUS","Sweedan, Amr M.I., Elastic local buckling of perforated webs of steel cellular beamcolumn elements, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 67, 7, pp. 1115-1127, (2011); Sonck, Delphine, Weak-axis flexural buckling of cellular and castellated columns, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 124, pp. 91-100, (2016); Ji, Jing, Structural application of engineered cementitious composites (ECC): A state-of-the-art review, Construction and Building Materials, 406, (2023); Ucak, Alper, Cellular and corrugated cross-sectioned thin-walled steel bridge-piers/columns, Structural Engineering and Mechanics, 24, 3, pp. 355-374, (2006); Lepcha, Karma Hissey, A numerical study on structural behaviour of lean duplex stainless steel tubular beams with rectangular web openings, Structures, 32, pp. 1233-1249, (2021); Ji, Jing, Axial compression behavior of strength-gradient composite stub columns encased CFST with small diameter: Experimental and numerical investigation, Structures, 47, pp. 282-298, (2023); Ji, Jing, Experimental Study of H-Shaped Honeycombed Stub Columns with Rectangular Concrete-Filled Steel Tube Flanges Subjected to Axial Load, Advances in Civil Engineering, 2021, (2021); Hassanien Serror, Mohammed Hassanien, Numerical study on buckling of steel web plates with openings, Steel and Composite Structures, 22, 6, pp. 1417-1443, (2016); Ellobody, Ehab A., Nonlinear analysis of cellular steel beams under combined buckling modes, Thin-Walled Structures, 52, pp. 66-79, (2012); Ji, Jing, Numerical study on the axial compression behavior of composite columns with steel tube SHCC flanges and honeycombed steel web, Engineering Structures, 283, (2023)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Therefore, it is crucial to consider the impact resistance of these walls and explore effective protection methods. The honeycomb structure, known for its energy-absorbing properties, has been widely utilized in aerospace, automotive, and maritime industries. However, there is a need for more research on applying honeycomb structures in energy-absorbing protection devices in civil engineering. This study proposes the use of honeycomb sandwich panels to protect civil air defense RC walls, creating a Honeycomb Sandwich Panel Composite RC wall (HSP-RC wall). Through pendulum impact experiments, we investigated the dynamic response of RC walls, both standard and HSP-RC walls with varying honeycomb parameters, under high-energy impacts. The goal was to evaluate the impact resistance of these RC walls, analyze the deformation differences among different HSP-RC walls, and examine the influence of honeycomb parameters on the impact protection effectiveness. The research results indicate that honeycomb sandwich panels can provide impact protection for RC walls by absorbing energy, and their protection effect is related to the parameters of the honeycomb core layer. This research result can be applied to RC structures that bear impact loads, achieving effective protection for RC structures. © 2024 by the authors.","civil air defense wall; energy absorption the pendulum experiment; honeycomb sandwich structure; impact","Aerospace industry; Automotive industry; Chemical plants; Critical path analysis; Crushed stone plants; Drug products plants; Fighter aircraft; Honeycomb structures; Marine industry; Military aviation; Petroleum products; Sandwich structures; Air-defence; Civil air defense wall; Energy; Energy absorption the pendulum experiment; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact; Impact protection; Reinforced concrete wall; Research results; Pendulums","Cheng, Jingsong, Effect of impact velocity on the failure modes of a RC beam, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 160, (2022); Jin, Liu, Impact resistance of RC beams under different combinations of mass and velocity: mesoscale numerical analysis, Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, 20, 4, (2020); Dok, Gokhan, Effect of impact loading on residual flexural capacity of high-strength reinforced concrete beams, Structures, 27, pp. 2466-2480, (2020); Gholipour, Gholamreza, Nonlinear Analysis of Shear-Deficient Beams Strengthened Using UHPFRC under Combined Impact and Blast Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 148, 6, (2022); Huynh, Luan, High strength and reactive powder concrete columns subjected to impact: Experimental investigation, Construction and Building Materials, 78, pp. 153-171, (2015); Gholipour, Gholamreza, Nonlinear failure analysis of bridge pier subjected to vessel impact combined with blast loads, Ocean Engineering, 234, (2021); Gholipour, Gholamreza, Effects of axial load on nonlinear response of RC columns subjected to lateral impact load: Ship-pier collision, Engineering Failure Analysis, 91, pp. 397-418, (2018); Liu, Bin, Experimental investigation and improved FE modeling of axially-loaded circular RC columns under lateral impact loading, Engineering Structures, 152, pp. 619-642, (2017); Cai, Jian, Numerical Study on Dynamic Response of Reinforced Concrete Columns under Low-speed Horizontal Impact Loading, Procedia Engineering, 210, pp. 334-340, (2017); Xiao, Yao, Behavior of reinforced concrete slabs under low-velocity impact, ACI Structural Journal, 114, 3, pp. 643-658, (2017)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

This article examines the extent to which carbon concrete sandwich elements can contribute to building protection as prefabricated walls. The composite material carbon concrete enables thin-walled constructions due to the corrosion-resistant reinforcement. The sandwich panel consists of two 3 cm thin carbon concrete layers. Between the layers 8 cm of mineral fibre wool is placed as an insulating layer. Thanks to the layered structure, prefabricated parts can be produced that fulfil the requirements for load-bearing capacity and building physics and can be used as wall elements in building envelopes. The article examines the extent to which such a sandwich wall element can provide structural protection against impact loads, such as those that can occur as a result of severe weather situations due to changed climatic conditions or anthropogenic causes. For this purpose, an impact test was carried out in the drop tower facility at TU Dresden. The damage caused by the impact, carried out with the compressed air-accelerated mode of the drop tower facility, with a mass of 8.4 kg at an impact velocity of 35 m/s in the carbon concrete sandwich panel is investigated. In the experimental investigation, the fotogrammetrically determined accelerations and deflections are documented. In addition, the punching shear failure and the perforation of the carbon concrete sandwich panel are analysed in numerical simulations and the results are compared with the experimentally determined data. © 2024 Ernst & Sohn GmbH.","carbon-reinforced concrete (CRC); drop-tower-experiment; simulation; textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) impact","Acceleration; Compressed air; Corrosion resistance; Drops; Honeycomb structures; Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Walls (structural partitions); Carbon-reinforced concrete; Drop towers; Drop-tower facility; Drop-tower-experiment; Experimental investigations; Impact loads; Sandwich element; Simulation; Textile reinforced concretes; Textile-reinforced concrete impact; Carbon","Schmitt, Daniel, Structural dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete slabs under impact loads for variable velocities, Beton- und Stahlbetonbau, 114, 8, pp. 526-536, (2019); Proceedings of the Fip Congress, (1987); Teil II Stahlbetonbauteile Und Bauwerke Unter Dynamischer Beanspruchung, (1988); Rs 165 IV Ultimate Kinetic Bearing Capacity of Reinforced Concrete Slabs, (1982); Sugano, T., Local damage to reinforced concrete structures caused by impact of aircraft engine missiles Part 1.

Using balsa wood face sheets and natural oak tree cupules for core reinforcement, the research aims to develop lightweight, sustainable structures. Three different cupule arrangements and geometries were tested, with and without polyurethane (PU) foam infill, to compare natural and commercial cores. The results show that cupule geometry significantly influences mechanical behaviour, demonstrating notable load-bearing and energy absorption capabilities, though with a tendency towards brittle fracture. Reinforcement techniques, such as cupule duplication and the integration of commercial PU foam, were explored to enhance load-bearing capacity and energy absorption while mitigating sudden failure. Panels reinforced with oak tree cupule-filled PU foam cores exhibited superior mechanical properties compared to non-reinforced cores. This study highlights the potential of using oak tree cupules to improve mechanical performance and sustainability in sandwich panel design. Furthermore, bio-inspired structures were fabricated via Multi Jet Fusion additive manufacturing, harnessing the unique properties of cupules to achieve superior mechanical performance in printed structures, emphasising their potential in structural engineering applications. © 2024 The Author(s).

Given the beneficial effects of zeolites on the properties of cementitious materials, the present paper aims to summarize the recent findings reported in the scientific literature on the use of zeolites in cement-based construction materials. This paper limits the analysis to natural zeolites. The influence of natural zeolites on the workability and setting time of cement-based construction materials revealed that increasing the zeolite content led to a reduction in workability compared to the control mixes. At the same time, the initial and final setting times of cement pastes showed a decreasing trend with an increase in the replacement percentage. The slow pozzolanic reaction of clinoptilolite zeolite results in lower flexural strength and compressive strength values of mortars at the age of 28 days. Blending zeolites with other supplementary cementitious materials resulted in improved values of the mechanical properties of mortar and concrete. The findings regarding the impact of zeolite on the durability of concrete suggest that zeolite shows promise as a viable alternative to cement, with positive effects on various aspects of durability. The majority of the durability factors are interconnected.

The mechanical properties of the additive manufacturing technology selective laser melting (AM-SLM) BHTS material AlSi10Mg were determined through quasi-static and medium-speed uniaxial compression tests. Based on the drop weight test models, the maximum impact force and duration, maximum displacement and residual displacement, energy proportion and other indicators, the impact of the buffer interlayer on the dynamic response of RC beams were compared under the drop weight test at different heights. The results showed that the proposed BHTS buffer interlayer has a very significant impact protection effect on the RC beam: the average energy absorption (EA) of the BHTS buffer interlayer is 25.65 % of the total internal energy, which greatly reduces the energy input into the RC beam. In addition, based on the study of the drop weight test simulation of BHTS buffer interlayer, an approximate calculation model for predicting the ultimate displacement of BHTS-RC beam is proposed, which can be used as an important method for assessing the damaging degree of reinforced beam under impact load quickly. BHTS can be used as a replaceable structure to avoid impact damage to RC components in structural engineering. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers","Buffer interlayer; Honeycomb structure; Numerical simulation; RC beam; Structural impact","Biomimetics; Compression testing; Drops; Honeycomb structures; Reinforced concrete; Silicon; Biological structures; Buffer interlayer; Drop weight tests; Engineering structures; FE model; Key parts; Reinforced concrete beams; Resistance behaviors; Structural impact; Thin-walled structures; Thin walled structures","Lu, Yaner, Analysis of failure of a bridge foundation under rock impact, Acta Geotechnica, 7, 1, pp. 57-68, (2012); Xie, Ruihong, Dynamic behavior and vulnerability analysis of bridge columns with different cross-sectional shapes under rockfall impacts, Structures, 26, pp. 471-486, (2020); Do, Tinvan, Impact responses of precast hollow reinforced concrete beams with prestress tendons using high-fidelity physics-based simulations, Engineering Failure Analysis, 131, (2022); Carta, Giorgio, Theoretical models to predict the flexural failure of reinforced concrete beams under blast loads, Engineering Structures, 49, pp. 306-315, (2013); undefined; undefined, (1999); Volkwein, Axel, Rockfall characterisation and structural protection - A review, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 11, 9, pp. 2617-2651, (2011); Pham, Tung Thanh, Performance of reinforced concrete beam with cushion subjected to impact loading, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 16, (2022); Pham, Thong M., Axial impact behavior and energy absorption of rubberized concrete with/without fiber-reinforced polymer confinement, International Journal of Protective Structures, 10, 2, pp. 154-173, (2019); Sukontasukkul, Piti, Use of rubberized concrete as a cushion layer in bulletproof fiber reinforced concrete panels, Construction and Building Materials, 41, pp. 801-811, (2013)",""

However, it is of vital importance to consistently improve the mineral PU, considering the significant amount of environmental deterioration to which it is prone. Laboratory experiments were used to model various coal mine conditions. Additionally, a workable technique for PU strengthening using ultrasonic waves was proposed. Compression tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to describe the PU–gangue material’s induration characteristics. The results showed that ultrasound has a positive impact on PU’s mechanical strength. The final strength of the PU was significantly impacted by the size of the coal gangue particles, the amount of dust, and the amount of water. The induration made of gangue and PU with the same mass but differing particle sizes was noticeably different in its compressive strength. The strengthening mechanism showed that the average size of the rigid foam after the ultrasound treatment was smaller, and the ‘honeycomb’-structured space in the inner section was more compact, resulting in the rigid PU foam having a higher compressive strength after ultrasound treatment. Furthermore, the dust content and water content of coal mines need to be controlled within a specific range to ensure the effective use of PU grouting materials. © 2023 by the authors.","gangue particle size; mineral grouting; polyurethane; ultrasound","Coal; Coal dust; Coal mines; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Concrete construction; Deterioration; Grouting; Mortar; Polyurethanes; Scanning electron microscopy; Ultrasonic applications; Condition; Environmental deterioration; Gangue particle size; Grouting materials; Laboratory experiments; Mine environment; Mineral grouting; Particles sizes; Strengthening methods; Ultrasound treatments; Particle size","Zhang, Chunjing, Polyurethane/red mud composites with flexibility, stretchability, and flame retardancy for grouting, Polymers, 10, 8, (2018); Yang, Zhengpeng, Flexible and stretchable polyurethane/waterglass grouting material, Construction and Building Materials, 138, pp. 240-246, (2017); Xu, Yitian, Mechanical properties, microstructure and consolidation of sand modified with sodium silicate, Engineering Geology, 310, (2022); Li, Guangzhi, Reinforcing effects of carbon nanotubes on cement-based grouting materials under dynamic impact loading, Construction and Building Materials, 382, (2023); Mei, Fanghua, Preparation and Performance Enhancements of Low-Heat-Releasing Polyurethane Grouting Materials with Epoxy Resin and Water Glass, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 13, (2022); He, Zhenglong, Effect of silane treatment on the mechanical properties of polyurethane/water glass grouting materials, Construction and Building Materials, 116, pp. 110-120, (2016); Cherednichenko, Kirill A., Fireproof Nanocomposite Polyurethane Foams: A Review, Polymers, 15, 10, (2023); Jia, Heyang, Experimental and Numerical Studies of Self-Expansible Polyurethane Slurry Diffusion Behavior in a Fracture Considering the Slurry Temperature, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 11, (2023); Park, Su-jeong, Tough and biodegradable polyurethane-silica hybrids with a rapid sol-gel transition for bone repair, NPG Asia Materials, 15, 1, (2023); Jena, Geetisubhra, A review on recent advances in graphene oxide-based composite coatings for anticorrosion applications, Progress in Organic Coatings, 173, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

It is a major test technology for the study of dynamic mechanical properties of materials. The expansion of the range of materials studied has also posed a challenge to the SHPB test technique, requiring some improvements to the conventional SHPB test apparatus and analysis methods to meet the test conditions and ensure the accuracy of its results. Based on a systematic review of the development of the SHPB test technique and the test principles, the main factors that influence the test’s ability to meet the two basic assumptions at this stage are analyzed, and the ways to handle them are summarized. The stress wave dispersion phenomenon caused by the transverse inertia effect of the pressure bar means that the test no longer satisfies the one-dimensional stress wave assumption, while the pulse-shaping technique effectively reduces the wave dispersion phenomenon and also has the effect of achieving constant strain rate loading and promoting the dynamic stress equilibrium of the specimen. Impedance matching between the pressure bar and specimen effectively solves the problem of the test’s difficulty because the transmitted signal is weak, and the assumption that the stress/strain is uniformly distributed along the length of the specimen is not satisfied when studying low-wave impedance material with the conventional SHPB test device. The appropriate pressure bar material can be selected according to the value of the wave impedance of the test material. According to the wave impedance values of different materials, the corresponding suggestions for the selection of pressure bar materials are given. Moreover, a new pressure bar material (modified gypsum) for materials with very-low-wave impedance is proposed. Finally, for some materials (foamed concrete, aluminum honeycomb, porous titanium, etc.) that cannot meet the two basic assumptions of the test, the Lagrangian analysis method can be combined with SHPB test technology application. Based on the analysis and calculation of the energy conservation equation, the dynamic constitutive relationship of the materials can be obtained without assuming the constitutive relationship of the experimental materials. © 2023 by the authors.","impedance matching; Lagrangian analysis method; pulse-shaping technique; split-Hopkinson pressure bar","Bridge decks; Dynamics; Lagrange multipliers; Materials properties; Mechanical testing; Pulse shaping; Strain rate; Stress analysis; Analysis method; Impedance matchings; Lagrangian analyse method; Lagrangian analysis; Pressure bar; Pulse shaping techniques; Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar test; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Test technology; Wave impedances; Dynamic loads","Zhu, Bin, Dynamic interaction of the pipe-soil subject to underground blasting excavation vibration in an urban soil-rock stratum, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 129, (2022); Chen, Yao, Characterization and modeling of a thermoplastic elastomer tissue simulant under uniaxial compression loading for a wide range of strain rates, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 131, (2022); Liao, Zhiyi, Determination of Dynamic Compressive and Tensile Behavior of Rocks from Numerical Tests of Split Hopkinson Pressure and Tension Bars, Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, 49, 10, pp. 3917-3934, (2016); Kumar, Suresh Muthu, High Strain Rate Behavior of Stir Cast Hybrid Al-Si Matrix Composites Using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar, Silicon, 16, 1, pp. 231-240, (2024); Yang, Shengqi, Experiment and numerical simulation study of dynamic mechanical behavior of granite specimen after high temperature treatment, Computers and Geotechnics, 154, (2023); Chen, Jingyi, Dynamic tensile strength enhancement of concrete in split Hopkinson pressure bar test, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 10, 6, (2018); Kumar, Devender, Triaxial Characterization of Foams at High Strain Rate Using Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar, Experimental Mechanics, 63, 7, pp. 1171-1192, (2023); Zhao, Geli, A modified triaxial split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system for quantifying the dynamic compressive response of porous rocks subjected to coupled hydraulic-mechanical loading, Geomechanics and Geophysics for Geo-Energy and Geo-Resources, 8, 1, (2022); Zhu, Changxing, Experimental and numerical research of crack propagation process and energy dissipation law of grouting specimens under radial impact load, Frontiers in Earth Science, 10, (2023); Liu, Feng, Strain-rate effect of polymers and correction methodology in a SHPB test, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 161, (2022)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

Three types of impact response modes of SSP-EASs were categorized according to the different crushing magnitudes of energy absorbing supports (EASs). In addition, the steel–concrete-steel sandwich panel (SSP) exhibited the combination of the global flexural deformation, local indentation and local bulging during the impact. The EAS could effectively absorb impact energy through the plastic bending of steel plates and the crushing of aluminum foam blocks, except for the response mode I with insignificant crushing of EASs. Moreover, the effects of crushing force of EASs and initial impact momentum on the dynamic responses of SSP-EAS were numerically analyzed. The impact resistance of the SSP-EAS could be improved through properly designing the EAS and assuring its maximum displacement slightly smaller than the compaction displacement during impact. In addition, the crushing force of EAS should not exceed the ultimate resistance of the SSP to assure the EAS being triggered to crush. Moreover, the SSP-EAS exhibited enhanced impact performances under higher initial impact momentum. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorber; Impact response; Impact test; Numerical simulation; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich panel","Aluminum; Concrete testing; Crushing; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Steel testing; Aluminium foam; Energy absorbers; Energy absorbing supports; Foam filled; Impact response; Impact test; Low velocity impact; Steel sandwich panels; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich panel; Dynamic response; aluminum; concrete; displacement; dynamic response; energy use; impact; loading; momentum; numerical method; steel structure","Ren, Yongli, Dynamic behavior and damage analysis of a spar-type floating offshore wind turbine under ship collision, Engineering Structures, 272, (2022); Luo, Gang, Dynamic response analysis of submerged floating tunnel under impact-vehicle load action, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 99, pp. 346-358, (2021); Wang, Wei, A simplified coupled model for predicting dynamic processes of vehicle impact on pier columns, Structures, 41, pp. 997-1013, (2022); Yan, Jiabao, Design and behavior of steel-concrete-steel sandwich plates subject to concentrated loads, Composite Structures, 150, pp. 139-152, (2016); Remennikov, Alex M., The response of axially restrained non-composite steel-concrete-steel sandwich panels due to large impact loading, Engineering Structures, 49, pp. 806-818, (2013); Xia, Hongxiang, Influence of strain rate effect on energy absorption characteristics of bio-inspired honeycomb column thin-walled structure under impact loading, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 18, (2023); Wang, Shilong, Energy-absorbing mechanism and crashworthiness performance of thin-walled tubes diagonally filled with rib-reinforced foam blocks under axial crushing, Composite Structures, 299, (2022); Eng Struct, (2023); Pan, Jin, Study on the performance of energy absorption structure of bridge piers against vehicle collision, Thin-Walled Structures, 130, pp. 85-100, (2018); Meng, Lingzhao, Experimental and numerical studies on steel-polyurethane foam-steel–concrete-steel panel under impact loading by a hemispherical head, Engineering Structures, 247, (2021)",""

Moreover, the impact force–time and displacement–time histories and the permanent deformation were discussed. The experiment results showed that increasing the steel faceplate thickness and concrete core height enhanced the impact performance of the SCSP-IACs. By contrast, increasing the IAC spacing weakened the impact performance. Moreover, the interlocking bolts slightly affected the impact responses of the SCSP-IACs.

This study investigates the flexural behavior of alkali-resistant glass-textile reinforced concrete (ARG-TRC) sandwich panels with different textile layers, core thicknesses, and interface forms under various impact velocities. A new manufacturing technique for ARG-TRC sandwich panels is proposed. The sandwich panels with four textile layers have superior load-carrying capability and impact resistance than those with two layers. The impact load can be transferred more effectively for panels with a core thickness of 40mm, allowing the top and bottom face-sheets to bear the load simultaneously for better impact resistance. Ribbed panels can reduce the possibility of side core tensile fracture and core crushing while improving flexural stiffness. It was also found that TRC sandwich panels typically exhibit four failure modes under the impact load, including face-sheet fracture, core shear fracture, side core tensile fracture, and core crushing fracture. The findings of this study can provide some insights into promoting the design and application of TRC sandwich panels in residential and industrial structures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic flexural behavior; Failure modes; Failure processes; Sandwich panels; Textile-reinforced concrete (TRC)","Compressive strength; Crushing; Failure modes; Fracture; Honeycomb structures; Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Tensile strength; Textiles; Alkali resistant; Concrete sandwich panel; Dynamic flexural behavior; Face sheets; Failure process; Flexural behavior; Impact loads; Sandwich panel; Textile reinforced concretes; Textile-reinforced concrete; Glass","Zou, Caineng Nneng, Connotation, innovation and vision of “carbon neutrality”, Natural Gas Industry B, 8, 5, pp. 523-537, (2021); Zhao, Xianbo, A bibliometric review of green building research 2000–2016, Architectural Science Review, 62, 1, pp. 74-88, (2019); Tang, Baojun, Pathways for decarbonizing China's building sector under global warming thresholds, Applied Energy, 298, (2021); Sun, Zhaohui, Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality in the Building Sector: A Bibliometric Review, Buildings, 12, 2, (2022); Chen, Liming, Compressive response of multi-layered thermoplastic composite corrugated sandwich panels: Modelling and experiments, Composites Part B: Engineering, 189, (2020); Taghizadeh, Seyed Ahmad, Characterization of compressive behavior of PVC foam infilled composite sandwich panels with different corrugated core shapes, Thin-Walled Structures, 135, pp. 160-172, (2019); undefined, (2019); Giglio, Marco, Investigations on sandwich core properties through an experimental- numerical approach, Composites Part B: Engineering, 43, 2, pp. 361-374, (2012); Kang, Junsuk Suk, Composite and non-composite behaviors of foam-insulated concrete sandwich panels, Composites Part B: Engineering, 68, pp. 153-161, (2015); Daniel Ronald Joseph, J., Precast concrete sandwich one-way slabs under flexural loading, Engineering Structures, 138, pp. 447-457, (2017)",""

Innovative technologies such as 3D construction printing can be applied in combination with recycling strategies in order to optimise their performances also from an environmental point of view. In fact, several studies have proposed the processing of waste material into printable material. At the same time, performance studies must be conducted on the building components produced by these methods. This study proposes a methodological approach to design a 3D printable building component made with recycled materials considering the improvement of thermal performances. In particular, the approach is based on three steps: reuse strategy conception; target performance definition, modelling and iterative simulation; 3D printing setting. The methodological approach has been applied to a 3D printable block using as printable material a cement-based mortar with recycled aggregates and recycled insulating material. As a result, the component’s shape (interlocking and inspired by honeycombs) can be customised to achieve the required thermal performance by using recycled materials in the printing process. © 2023, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia..

The MCSCS sandwich panel employed stiffeners and headed studs to improve the bonding behavior between faceplates and concrete core as well as enhance its composite action and impact resistance. Impact tests were conducted on seven MCSCS panels via employing a drop weight loading system, and the influences of impact direction, spacing of headed stud and steel plate thickness on responses of MCSCS panels were investigated. Furthermore, the Finite Element (FE) model of the MCSCS panel was established, and the FE predictions were shown to be reasonable as compared to test results. Two types of failure modes of MCSCS panels under impact load were obtained via analyzing the test and FE results. In addition, based on the verified FE model, the influences of stiffeners, impact location and curvature of hammer head on impact responses of MCSCS panels were revealed via parametric studies. The results of FE simulations indicated that the impact location and curvature of hammer head had evident effect on the energy absorption and impact response of the MCSCS panel. Moreover, owing to the employment of stiffeners, the impact resistance of the MCSCS panel was evidently enhanced as compared to the traditional SCS panel. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Failure mode; Impact response; Multi-cell; Steel–concrete–steel sandwich panel","Concrete slabs; Failure modes; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Studs (fasteners); Studs (structural members); Finite element modelling (FEM); Headed stud; Impact locations; Impact response; Multicell; Steel concrete; Steel panels; Steel sandwich panels; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich; Steel–concrete–steel sandwich panel; Hammers","Asad, Mohammad, Assessing vibration induced damage in unreinforced masonry walls subject to vehicular impact – A numerical study, Engineering Structures, 245, (2021); Sohel, Kazi Md Abu, Behavior and design of reinforced concrete building columns subjected to low-velocity car impact, Structures, 26, pp. 601-616, (2020); Sharma, Hrishikesh, Performance-based response evaluation of reinforced concrete columns subject to vehicle impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 52-62, (2012); Roy, Tathagata, Probabilistic framework for failure investigation of reinforced concrete wall panel under dynamic blast loads, Engineering Failure Analysis, 125, (2021); Do, Tinvan, Impact force profile and failure classification of reinforced concrete bridge columns against vehicle impact, Engineering Structures, 183, pp. 443-458, (2019); Zhao, Chunfeng, Blast behavior of steel-concrete-steel sandwich panel: Experiment and numerical simulation, Engineering Structures, 246, (2021); Richard Liew, J.

The failure modes of the SCS-EC under impact loading could be categorized into two types based on the crushing magnitude of the energy absorption connector (EC). The EC was found to effectively dissipate impact energy via the plastic deformation of pleated steel plates and the compression of aluminum foam fillers. The steel-concrete-steel (SCS) panel showed the combination of global and local deformation under impact loading. Moreover, the influences of pleated plate thickness (t<inf>p</inf>) and angle (θ<inf>p</inf>), aluminum foam filler and initial momentum on the impact performances of the SCS-EC were studied quantitatively.

In this study, finite element (FE) models are successfully established to gain insight into the collision between a modified barge and a three-column bridge pier in the non-navigable zone. Firstly, numerical models of the bridge pier and barge are satisfactorily verified against experimental results, through which the dynamic performance of the bridge under typical collision scenarios is investigated with respect to the kinetic energy, internal energy, and impact force. A new performance index, i.e., internal energy power slope (IEPS), calculated from the second derivative of the structural internal energy, is then proposed to prescribe the damage states of the impacted column. The usefulness and applicability of the IEPS are further explored through structural reliability analysis and a parametric study. Moreover, the efficacy of two protective jackets made in alloy honeycomb (AH) and aluminum foam (AF) for enhancing the structural anti-impact capacity is investigated by comparing the associated values of IEPS. It is observed that the proposed IEPS has a strong correlation with the structural damage state, and thus can be favourably used as a new performance metric for analyzing barge-pier collisions. The results also evidence that adopting UHPC (ultra-high performance concrete), densifying stirrup spacing, and adding protective jackets are effective measures to reduce the IEPS and hence improve the structural anti-impact capacity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Barge-pier collision; Finite element method; IEPS (Internal energy power slope); Protective jacket; Reliability; Triple-column bridge pier","Barges; High performance concrete; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Piers; Reliability analysis; Anti impacts; Barge-pier collision; Damage state; Dynamic performance; Energies (power); Impact capacity; Internal energies; Internal energy power slope; Protective jackets; Triple-column bridge pier; Finite element method; barge; bridge construction; collision avoidance; column; finite element method","Guide Specification and Commentary for Vessel Collision Design of Highway Bridges, (2025); Lrfd Bridge Design Specifications, (2004); Alsos, Hagbart Skage, On the resistance of tanker bottom structures during stranding, Marine Structures, 20, 4, pp. 218-237, (2007); Aldosary, Muhannad Haqi, Structural reliability and stochastic finite element methods: State-of-the-art review and evidence-based comparison, Engineering Computations, 35, 6, pp. 2165-2214, (2018); Ambriz, R.

In the present study, a layered graded foam concrete-filled auxetic honeycomb was proposed by tuning its overall compression deformation mode to layer-by-layer deformation mode to realize multi-level structural protection. The effect of the honeycomb cell-wall thickness gradient (with an average thickness of 0.25 mm, thickness gradients of 0.30:0.25:0.20, 0.35:0.25:0.15 and 0.40:0.25:0.10, and corresponding positive gradients) and the foam concrete filler density gradient (408:575:848, 848:575:408) on the response mode, load transfer, energy absorption, and Poisson’s ratio of the proposed composite was systematically investigated. The results showed that the graded composite exhibited an obvious layered deformation mode and a negative Poisson’s ratio effect under relatively low and moderate loading rates (1 m/s, 10 m/s, respectively), especially with the foam concrete density gradient. Under a high loading rate (100 m/s), the graded composite demonstrated progressive collapse initiating from the loading end with a layer-by-layer crushing mode, regardless of the thickness and density gradient. In the response of the composite with a 0.2:0.2:0.2 thickness ratio and a 408:575:848 foam concrete gradient subjected to 1 m/s crushing, the first-layer, second-layer, and third-layer foam concrete absorbed 94.62%, 88.72%, and 86.94% of the total foam concrete energy absorption in the corresponding crushing stage, respectively. Compared with the counterpart homogeneous composites, although the graded composite had an insignificant improvement on energy absorption (less than 5%), it was able to significantly reduce the peak load (as high as 30%) to mitigate the load transfer to the protected structure. The effective Poisson’s ratio of the first layer in the composite with positive gradient (408:575:848) increased to −2 then converged to −0.6 under 2 m/s and 10 m/s crushing, and ranged from −0.4 to −0.1 under 50 m/s and 100 m/s crushing, respectively. The effective Poisson’s ratio of the middle and bottom layers increased to −2 initially and converged to range −0.4 to −0.1, regardless of the crushing speed. The staged response mode of the graded composite facilitated the realization of multi-level structure protection with significantly reduced peak load transferred to the protected structure and tuned energy absorption. © 2023 by the authors.","auxetic honeycomb; energy absorption; foam concrete; impact mitigation; structure protection","Compressive strength; Concretes; Crushing; Foams; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Structural dynamics; Auxetic honeycomb; Auxetics; Deformation modes; Foam concretes; Graded composites; Impact mitigation; Load transfer; S ratio; Structure protection; Thickness gradients; Energy absorption","Hao, Hong, Review of the current practices in blast-resistant analysis and design of concrete structures, Advances in Structural Engineering, 19, 8, pp. 1193-1223, (2016); Zhang, Duo, Experimental study on scaling of RC beams under close-in blast loading, Engineering Failure Analysis, 33, pp. 497-504, (2013); Hao, Hong, On the accuracy, reliability and controllability of impact tests of RC beams, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 157, (2021); Song, Dianyi, Experimental investigation on the cellular steel-tube-confined concrete targets against projectile impact, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 131, pp. 94-110, (2019); Temsah, Yehya A., Numerical Derivation of Iso-Damaged Curve for a Reinforced Concrete Beam Subjected to Blast Loading, MATEC Web of Conferences, 149, (2018); Li, Zhejian, Blast mitigation performance of cladding using square dome-shape kirigami folded structure as core, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 145, pp. 83-95, (2018); Tarlochan, Faris, Sandwich structures for energy absorption applications: A review, Materials, 14, 16, (2021); Cai, Sipei, Experimental study on failure mechanisms of sandwich panels with multi-layered aluminum foam/UHMWPE laminate core under combined blast and fragments loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 159, (2021); Zhang, Jianxun, Dynamic response of double-layer rectangular sandwich plates with metal foam cores subjected to blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 122, pp. 265-275, (2018); Studziński, Robert, Blast test and failure mechanisms of soft-core sandwich panels for storage halls applications, Materials, 14, 1, pp. 1-14, (2021)","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access"

Unsurprisingly, a lot of effort is dedicated to searching for suitable replacing materials of concrete constituents, e.g. of mineral aggregate that usually forms 70–80 vol% of fresh concrete mix, not only to reduce the depletion of our natural resources, but, at the same time, to improve some of the concrete properties. For example, dense building materials are not very effective in acoustic-insulation performance. In this context, renewable resources can provide a possible solution in the preparation of advanced concrete composites that will help to reduce noise originating in high populated urban and/or industrialized areas. This paper is focused on the application of carbonized lightweight bio-based aggregate (BA), having about 63 % lower thermal conductivity compared to the traditional ones, in the manufacturing of lightweight concretes which, related to BA quantity in mixes, dispose with considerably mitigated thermal transport properties and enhanced acoustic-insulation function. Traditional dense aggregate was replaced with the bio-based alternative in the amount of 0–100 vol% and the batch water content was adjusted to keep similar consistency (class S4) of fresh concrete mixes. After 28 days of water curing, the development of dry bulk density, open porosity, flexural and compressive strengths as well as thermal and acoustic performance in the dependence on bio-based aggregate content were determined on hardened specimens. Experimental investigation revealed significant lightening effect of BA particles having a honeycomb-like porous structure and thus promoting the high thermal and acoustic performance of developed concretes. Accordingly, hardened concrete samples with alternative aggregate content only showed 7.5 times lower thermal transport and about 16.2 % improved acoustic performance compared with ordinary dense concrete. In addition, lower BA dosages (up to 50 vol%) allowed to produce concretes disposing sufficient strength parameters – average flexural strength about 6.5 MPa and compressive strength about 27.0 MPa maintaining their usage for structural purposes. Furthermore, bio-based aggregates are sorted among renewable resources that may mitigate environmental impacts connected with the quarrying of traditional filling materials, and thus contribute to higher sustainability of concrete production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic performance; Bio-based aggregate; Concrete manufacturing; Sustainability; Thermal insulation","Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Environmental impact; Hardening; Light weight concrete; Porosity; Sustainable development; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulating materials; Acoustic performance; Aggregate contents; Bio-based; Bio-based aggregate; Buildings materials; Concrete manufacturing; Fresh concrete mixes; Renewable resource; Thermal Performance; Thermal-insulating; Thermal insulation","Chi, Maochieh, Effect of aggregate properties on the strength and stiffness of lightweight concrete, Cement and Concrete Composites, 25, 2, pp. 197-205, (2003); Kolawole, John Temitope, Performance of concrete containing Nigerian electric arc furnace steel slag aggregate towards sustainable production, Sustainable Materials and Technologies, 25, (2020); Chan, Ricardo, Parametric study of functionally graded concretes incorporating steel fibres and recycled aggregates, Construction and Building Materials, 242, (2020); Pokorny, Jaroslav, The design and material characterization of reclaimed asphalt pavement enriched concrete for construction purposes, Materials, 13, 21, pp. 1-17, (2020); Pelisser, Fernando, Concrete made with recycled tire rubber: Effect of alkaline activation and silica fume addition, Journal of Cleaner Production, 19, 6-7, pp. 757-763, (2011); Tam, Vivian W.Y., Comparing the implementation of concrete recycling in the Australian and Japanese construction industries, Journal of Cleaner Production, 17, 7, pp. 688-702, (2009); Brito, Jorge De, Recycled Aggregate in Concrete: Use of Industrial, Construction and Demolition Waste, Green Energy and Technology, 54, (2013); Chinnu, S.

A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of AHSP under ice impact is established based on a concrete constitutive ice model in the commercial package ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The impact force-displacement curves and energy absorption properties as well as the crushing process of ice wedge are numerically achieved. In addition, the ice wedge impact tests of AHSPs were conducted by using a horizontal impact experimental apparatus. Furthermore, the effects of impact parameters and structural parameters on the dynamic responses and energy absorption are performed. Results show that the numerical results of ice wedge-AHSP impact dynamic responses are consistent well with the experimental results. The permanent deformation profiles of face sheets are approximately axisymmetric about the vertical and horizontal centerline. The ice impact energy is mainly converted into the plastic deformation energy of AHSP and rebound kinetic energy of ice wedge as well as the fracture energy of ice wedge. With the increase of the impact energy and thickness of face sheets, the energy dissipation ratio of ice broken increases dramatically and the energy dissipation by ice wedge makes an increasingly contribution to the impact energy absorption. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminium honeycomb sandwich panel; Dynamic response; Energy absorption; Horizontal impact experiment; Ice wedge impact","Aluminum; Dynamic response; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Ice; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Sandwich structures; Aluminium honeycomb; Aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel; Face sheets; Honeycomb sandwich panels; Horizontal impact experiment; Ice wedge impact; Ice wedges; Impact energy; Impact experiment; Sandwich panel; Energy absorption","Marine Structures, (2010); Kujala, Pentti, Review of risk-based design for ice-class ships, Marine Structures, 63, pp. 181-195, (2019); Shamaei, Farhang, Local pressures for ships in ice: Probabilistic analysis of full-scale line-load data, Marine Structures, 74, (2020); Yu, Zhaolong, Glacial ice impacts: Part II: Damage assessment and ice-structure interactions in accidental limit states (ALS), Marine Structures, 75, (2021); Timco, Garry W., A review of the engineering properties of sea ice, Cold Regions Science and Technology, 60, 2, pp. 107-129, (2010); Sun, Jianqiao, Investigations on the ship-ice impact: Part 1.

Based on the large-scale low-speed pendulum impact test and the corresponding finite element model, this study establishes an ideal model for the honeycomb sandwich panel under the impact of a square flat head and gives the corresponding theoretical derivation.

The effects of concrete core thickness, steel plate thickness, presence of stiffeners, and drop height on the dynamic responses of SESCS sandwich panels were experimentally revealed. All the tested panels exhibited the combined failure mode of global flexure and local indentation, and the SESCS sandwich panel demonstrated improved impact resistance.

In this study, the novel foamed concrete-filled honeycombs (FCFHs) with tailored geometrical architectures of additively manufactured polymeric honeycombs were developed. The in-plane crushing performance of FCFHs subjected to quasi-static and impact loadings was investigated experimentally and numerically. It was demonstrated that the existence of foamed concrete within honeycomb cells greatly strengthens the collapse resistance of cell walls, and the premature failure of foamed concretes in FCFH is effectively prevented. The shear-dominated failure mode of FCFHs with honeycombs of relatively large cell size or regular configuration or low relative density gradually transforms to a global compression deformation by decreasing cell size or increasing cell irregularity or relative density of honeycomb. Benefiting from the interaction-induced reinforcement between the involved components, the mechanical properties of FCFHs are highly dependent on the mesostructures of honeycomb skeleton. Specially, a decrease of cell size from 5 mm to 3.5 mm yields an increase in the mean crushing strength and the specific energy absorption of FCFHs up to 49.6% and 69.0%, respectively. Further, a numerical model, which was validated against experimental tests, was adopted to study the dynamic behavior of FCFHs. It transpires that the contribution of each component to the energy absorption, relating to the mesoscale deformation mechanism, largely depends on impact velocity.

All the tested FS-C-CS sandwich panels exhibited combination of local indention and global flexural deformation mode. Three stages of impact process were identified based on the characteristics of impact force and displacement response histories. In addition, the Finite Element (FE) model of the FS-C-CS panel under impact load was established, and the failure modes and impact energy dissipation performances of the FS-C-CS panels were obtained. The results showed that the concrete core dissipated the majority of impact energy, followed by corrugated plate and flat plate. Furthermore, the impact resistant performance of the FS-C-CS panel was found to be improved as compared to the traditional SCS sandwich panel with two flat faceplates in terms of smaller deformation as well as larger impact force and post-peak mean force. Moreover, the effects of corrugated steel plate height and steel plate thickness on impact responses of the FS-C-CS panels were analyzed. The results indicated that increasing corrugated plate height could reduce the maximum deformation of the FS-C-CS panel. Increasing corrugated plate thickness resulted in the reduction of maximum deformation, but increase of maximum impact force and post-peak mean force. The FE parametric studies also showed that decreasing the spacings of shear connectors as well as increasing the compressive strength of concrete and employing end plates led to improved impact resistance of the FS-C-CS panel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Composite panel; Drop-weight impact test; Finite element simulation; Impact response; Steel-concrete-steel panel","Compressive strength; Concretes; Deformation; Drops; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Impact testing; Sandwich structures; Composite panels; Corrugated plate; Corrugated steel; Drop-weight impact test; Finite elements simulation; Impact force; Impact response; Sandwich panel; Steel plates; Steel-concrete-steel panel; Finite element method","Zhu, Hua, Dynamic response of a novel laminated glass panel using a transparent glass fiber-reinforced composite interlayer under blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 89, pp. 14-24, (2016); Mehreganian, Navid, Plastic dynamic response of simply supported thick square plates subject to localised blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 126, pp. 85-100, (2019); Micallef, Karl, The dynamic performance of simply-supported rigid-plastic circular steel plates subjected to localised blast loading, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 65, 1, pp. 177-191, (2012); Li, Zhan, Experimental and numerical study on CFRP strip strengthened clay brick masonry walls subjected to vented gas explosions, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 129, pp. 66-79, (2019); Sohel, Kazi Md Abu, Behavior and design of reinforced concrete building columns subjected to low-velocity car impact, Structures, 26, pp. 601-616, (2020); Do, Tinvan, Impact force profile and failure classification of reinforced concrete bridge columns against vehicle impact, Engineering Structures, 183, pp. 443-458, (2019); Ning, Jianguo, Failure analysis of reinforced concrete slab under impact loading using a novel numerical method, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 144, (2020); Xu, Xiangzhao, Failure analytical model of reinforced concrete slab under impact loading, Construction and Building Materials, 223, pp. 679-691, (2019); Oucif, Chahmi H., Damage modeling of ballistic penetration and impact behavior of concrete panel under low and high velocities, Defence Technology, 17, 1, pp. 202-211, (2021); undefined",""

However, the application of these techniques to stress-wave methods such as impact-echo and impulse-response data for local level detection has been limited. In this research, statistical pattern recognition in conjunction with the impulse-response test is shown to provide an efficient means for the detection of defects in concrete plates. For this purpose, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) derived from the impulse-response test following ASTM C1740 protocols at specific points on the test plate to define the feature space matrix. Analytical results demonstrate that the variability of the FRF increases in the presence of defects, which forms the physical basis for the proposed pattern recognition algorithm. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on the covariance of the feature space matrix to identify the dominant features of the FRFs and to determine the number of statistically significant factors or principal components. Factor scores are next used to identify locations on the plate that are associated most closely to each pattern. The generalized Extreme Value Studentized (ESD) test and box and whisker plots are applied to the factor score vector of all the test points to objectively identify test points with defects and rank these based on their severity. Two experimental specimens are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed detection algorithm. The first specimen, a partially reinforced clamped concrete plate, is used to demonstrate the relationship between the shapes and variability of the FRFs and the severity of defects (delaminations), the efficacy of the factor score as damage sensitive feature, and identification and the ranking of the severity of defects by using outlier statistical tests. The second specimen is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the procedure for detecting both void and honeycomb defects in a larger reinforced concrete plate on elastic supports. The proposed procedure is shown to provide similar levels of detectability as the highly refined yet time consuming ultrasonic shear-wave tomography test. While the impulse-response test has been in use for the condition assessment of concrete elements other than drilled shaft piles since 1980′s, defect detection has been based primarily on empirical observations and correlations with limited features of the frequency response function. The use of pattern recognition techniques to the full range of the frequency response function is proposed and shown to greatly improve the detection and characterization of defects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Frequency response function; Honeycomb; Impulse-response test; Outlier detection; Plate on elastic foundation; Principal component analysis","Anomaly detection; Covariance matrix; Damage detection; Defects; Frequency response; Honeycomb structures; Impulse response; Plates (structural components); Reinforced concrete; Shear flow; Statistical tests; Statistics; Structural health monitoring; Concrete plates; Defect detection; Factor scores; Feature space; Frequency response functions; Impulse-response test; Outlier Detection; Plates on elastic foundations; Principal-component analysis; Statistical pattern recognition; Principal component analysis","undefined; undefined, (2015); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2011); Zhu, Jinying, Imaging concrete structures using air-coupled impact-echo, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 133, 6, pp. 628-640, (2007); Ham, Suyun, Application of micro-electro-mechanical sensors contactless NDT of concrete structures, Sensors, 15, 4, pp. 9078-9096, (2015); de la Haza, Aldo O., Assessment of concrete structures using the Mira and Eyecon ultrasonic shear wave devices and the SAFT-C image reconstruction technique, Construction and Building Materials, 38, pp. 1276-1291, (2013); Martin, Julia, Ultrasonic tomography of grouted duct post-tensioned reinforced concrete bridge beams, NDT and E International, 34, 2, pp. 107-113, (2001); Sun, Hongbin, Nondestructive evaluation of concrete bridge decks with automated acoustic scanning system and ground penetrating radar, Sensors, 18, 6, (2018); Tarussov, Alexander, Condition assessment of concrete structures using a new analysis method: Ground-penetrating radar computer-assisted visual interpretation, Construction and Building Materials, 38, pp. 1246-1254, (2013)",""

The blast capacities of steel–concrete-steel (SCS) sandwich, concrete-steel–concrete (CSC), and reinforced concrete (RC) slabs were investigated by experiment and numerical simulation. The effects of the explosive charge, concrete grade, steel plate thickness, and length of shear studs on the blast behaviors of the composite slabs were studied by parametric analysis. The failure modes and dynamic responses of the specimens were investigated and compared. Simultaneously, the empirical formulas for mid-span deflection of the SCS and CSC slabs were proposed by using a multiple nonlinear regression analysis method. The results indicated that the three specimens exhibit different failure modes, in terms of local damage, spallation of concrete, and punching failure. And the steel plate takes a dominant role against the blast loads, which can provide a robust protective capacity to prevent the slab from damage due to the high tensile strength of steel. The SCS sandwich slab has the smallest damaged area on the front steel plate with a smaller mid-span displacement, maintains the integrity, and owns bearing capacity after the blast test compared with the CSC and RC members. The proposed empirical formula can well fit the relation among the deflection of the composite slabs, explosive charge, and thickness of steel plate, which can reasonably predict the midspan displacements of the composite slabs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-explosion capacity; Contact explosion; Empirical formula; Failure mode; Steel-concrete-steel (SCS) sandwich panel","Energy dissipation; Explosions; Explosives; Failure modes; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Regression analysis; Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Shear flow; Tensile strength; Anti-explosion capacity; Composite slab; Contact explosion; Empirical formulas; Explosive charges; Steel concrete; Steel plates; Steel reinforced; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich panel; Steel-concrete-steel sandwich; Honeycomb structures; blasting; concrete; dynamic response; empirical analysis; experiment; explosion; failure mechanism; numerical model; steel structure","Castedo, Ricardo, Air blast resistance of full-scale slabs with different compositions: Numerical modeling and field validation, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 86, pp. 145-156, (2015); Zheng, Cheng, Experimental and numerical studies on the dynamic response of steel plates subjected to confined blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 113, pp. 144-160, (2018); Zhao, Chunfeng, Damage mechanism and response of reinforced concrete containment structure under internal blast loading, Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics, 61, 1, pp. 12-20, (2012); Wei, Wang, Experimental study on scaling the explosion resistance of a one-way square reinforced concrete slab under a close-in blast loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 49, pp. 158-164, (2012); Yan, Bo, Numerical study on damage mechanism of RC beams under close-in blast loading, Engineering Failure Analysis, 51, pp. 9-19, (2015); Meghdadaian, Mohammad, Improving seismic performance of composite steel plate shear walls containing openings, Journal of Building Engineering, 21, pp. 336-342, (2019); Zhao, Qiuhong, Cyclic behavior of traditional and innovative composite shear walls, Journal of Structural Engineering, 130, 2, pp. 271-284, (2004); Zhao, Chunfeng, Simplified theoretical analysis and numerical study on the dynamic behavior of FCP under blast loads, Frontiers of Structural and Civil Engineering, 14, 4, pp. 983-997, (2020); Wang, Yonghui, Responses of curved steel-concrete-steel sandwich shells subjected to blast loading, Thin-Walled Structures, 108, pp. 185-192, (2016); Meghdadian, Mohammad, Proposition of an equivalent reduced thickness for composite steel plate shear walls containing an opening, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 168, (2020)",""

In this paper, numerical and analytical investigations were performed to study the impact resistance of SCS sandwich panels against rigid projectile penetration. FE simulations of concrete-steel perforation were conducted to validate the numerical model in terms of projectile residual velocity and damage mode. With same concrete core, five thickness combinations of front and rear steel plates were numerically studied to explore the sandwich structural effect on the perforation responses. Utilizing spherical cavity expansion analysis and plates petalling theory, a semi-empirical analytical model was developed to describe the perforation on SCS sandwich panels, which was characterized with 7 penetration stages. Agreement was reached between numerical simulation and theoretical model in terms of both projectile deceleration history and residual velocity. On the perspective of structurally absorbed energy, the thickness combinations of front and rear steel plate were further analyzed and discussed. For the same thickness, the rear steel plate was found to consume more energy than the front plate, which provides better protection against projectile impact loadings. © 2020 The Author(s)","Cavity expansion analysis; Energy consumption; FE simulation; Petalling of steel plates; SCS sandwich panels","Analytical models; Honeycomb structures; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Analytical investigations; Projectile impact; Projectile residual velocity; Residual velocity; Spherical cavity expansion; Steel sandwich panels; Structural effect; Theoretical modeling; Concretes","Sandwich Structures 7 Advancing with Sandwich Structures and Materials, (2005); Richard Liew, J.

This works intends to find which design alternative is more eco-efficient. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was the method used for the quantification and comparison of environmental and economic impacts of the studied solutions. The environmental and economic LCA of this type of construction products are presented for the first time in this paper. These LCA were completed following European and international standards. The results obtained demonstrated that, for both alternatives, in terms of environmental LCA of the production, the stage of raw materials extraction (A1) is the most influential for all the studied environmental impact categories. By comparing the two alternatives, it was found that the second panel (hybrid sandwich panel) presents the highest environmental impact. More specifically, the results obtained show that the use of SFRMC for the top skin and of carbon fibres significantly increases the environmental impact of the product. Furthermore, an economic comparison of the production showed that the hybrid panel is a more expensive alternative as well. It was found that panel a1 is better than panel b1 because, in addition to the lower cost (the production cost of the latter is 24% higher than that of panel a1), it is also more environmentally friendly at the production stage (impacts of panel b1 are between 3% and 27% higher than panel a1 in categories PE-NRe, PE-Re, ADP, GWP and EP, while the latter presents impacts between 2% and 10% higher than panel b1 in categories POCP, AP and ODP). As so, the most efficient profile both economically and environmentally is profile a1, which is composed of GFRP and PUR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building; Composite sandwich panels; GFRP; Life cycle assessment; Rehabilitation; Structural floors","Economic and social effects; Foams; Glass; Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Service life; Shotcreting; Steel fibers; Wooden floors; Composite sandwich panels; Construction products; Design alternatives; Economic comparisons; Environmental and economic impacts; International standards; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Materials extraction; Environmental impact; building; composite; floor; life cycle analysis; reinforced concrete; structural response","undefined, (2003); Residential Stock and Its Rehabilitation Portrait and Prospect in Portuguese, (2013); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2013); Concrete Repairs Performance in Service and Current Practice, (2007); Country Report 74th Euroconstruct Conference, (2012); Ramôa Correia, João Ramôa, GFRP-concrete hybrid cross-sections for floors of buildings, Engineering Structures, 31, 6, pp. 1331-1343, (2009); undefined, (2006); undefined; Ferreiro, J., Sensitivity analysis of Life Cycle Assessment to select reinforced concrete structures with one-way slabs, Engineering Structures, 132, pp. 586-596, (2017)",""

Inspired by many biological structures in nature, bio-inspired structures have been proved to exhibit a significant improvement over conventional structures in energy absorption capacity. Therefore, use of the biomimetic approach for designing novel lightweight structures with excellent energy absorption capacity has been increasing in engineering fields in recent years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the development of bio-inspired structures for energy absorption applications. In particular, we describe the unique features and remarkable mechanical properties of biological structures such as plants and animals, which can be mimicked to design efficient energy absorbers. Next, we review and discuss the structural designs as well as the energy absorption characteristics of current bio-inspired structures with different configurations and structures, including multi-cell tubes, frusta, sandwich panels, composite plates, honeycombs, foams, building structures and lattices. These materials have been used for bio-inspired structures, including but not limited to metals, polymers, fibre-reinforced composites, concrete and glass. We also discussed the manufacturing techniques of bio-inspired structures based on conventional methods, and adaptive manufacturing (3D printing). Finally, contemporary challenges and future directions for bio-inspired structures are presented.

Therefore, this study investigates sandwich beams with textile reinforced cementitious composite faces subjected to heat-rain, heat-cold and/or freeze-thaw cycles to simulate the different weathering conditions. To separate the degradation effects at the sandwich element level from the degradation mechanism related to the face material level, also textile reinforced cementitious composite plates were subjected to identical environmental loading. The observations at the material level did not match the observations at the element level. While the structural performance of the textile reinforced cementitious composite plates was strongly affected by the durability cycles, the sandwich panels showed a non-degraded mechanical response after environmental loading. © 2019","Accelerated ageing; Digital Image Correlation (DIC); Environmental loading; Four-point bending tests; Sandwich plates; Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC); Uniaxial tensile tests","Bending tests; Composite beams and girders; Durability; Honeycomb structures; Plates (structural components); Reinforced concrete; Sandwich structures; Tensile testing; Weathering; Accelerated ageing; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Environmental loadings; Four-point bending test; Sandwich plates; Textile reinforced concretes; Uniaxial tensile test; Textiles","Cuypers, Heidi, Analysis and verification of the performance of sandwich panels with textile reinforced concrete faces, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 13, 5, pp. 589-603, (2011); Junes, Angel, An experimental and theoretical study of sandwich panels with TRC facings: Use of metallic connectors and TRC stiffeners, Engineering Structures, 113, pp. 174-185, (2016); Malaga, Katarina, Textile reinforced concrete sandwich panels, pp. 169-172, (2012); Vervloet, Jolien, Experimental investigation of the buckling behaviour of Textile Reinforced Cement sandwich panels with varying face thickness using Digital Image Correlation, Construction and Building Materials, 194, pp. 24-31, (2019); Colombo, Isabella Giorgia, Bending behaviour of Textile Reinforced Concrete sandwich beams, Construction and Building Materials, 95, pp. 675-685, (2015); Struct Concr, (2015); International Rilem Conference on Material Science, (2010); Shams, Ali, Experimental investigations on textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) sandwich sections, Composite Structures, 118, 1, pp. 643-653, (2014); Williams Portal, Natalie Leonor, Bending behaviour of novel Textile Reinforced Concrete-foamed concrete (TRC-FC) sandwich elements, Composite Structures, 177, pp. 104-118, (2017); Butler, Marko, Experimental investigations on the durability of fibre-matrix interfaces in textile-reinforced concrete, Cement and Concrete Composites, 31, 4, pp. 221-231, (2009)",""

For the outer envelope, the consortium proposed textile reinforced concrete precast sandwich panels. The high durability, high aesthetic potential, low impact on occupant life during installation, and increase in impact resistance make this solution competitive with the exterior insulation and finishing system, now the most widespread energy retrofitting method adopted on existing buildings.

To help develop a high-performance protective system, this article outlines the performance evaluation of five different auxetic cell configurations based on a quantitative/qualitative review of an experimental load–deformation relationship of three-dimensional-printed auxetic panels from nylon plastics and the overall performance evaluation of metallic re-entrant honeycomb core sandwich panels as one type of lightweight protective system under static and dynamic loads via experimental testing and numerical simulations. The re-entrant honeycomb design displayed the most consistent auxetic behaviour. Quasi-static compression and drop hammer impact tests were performed using the proposed full-scale sandwich panel design with two different configurations as a protective system for concrete wall structures in combination with plastic face plates. The effect of the internal angle of the re-entrant honeycomb design and the effect of the core material under static and dynamic loads were evaluated using full-scale sandwich panels. Furthermore, two separate materials – acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and low-density polyethylene – were used as face plates, and the low-density polyethylene was effective for lightweight and smooth load transferring and distribution into the auxetic core. Auxetic panel deformation under static and dynamic load was examined using a normal speed camera and high-speed video recording data and all auxetic panels indicated excellent systematic crushing behaviour with drawing materials into the load path to effectively resist the impact load. Numerical simulations were performed using LS-DYNA and indicated good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, protective systems utilising sandwich panels with a re-entrant honeycomb core indicated strong potential for the development of high-performance lightweight impact-resistant protective systems. © The Author(s) 2019.","Auxetic; finite element analysis; impact loading; large-scale; negative Poisson’s ratio; sandwich panels; three-dimensional printing","3D printers; Accidents; Coremaking; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Finite element method; High speed cameras; Military vehicles; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Polyethylenes; Sandwich structures; Styrene; Video recording; Auxetic; Impact loadings; large-scale; S ratio; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","Chen, Wensu, Numerical simulations of stiffened multi-arch double-layered panels subjected to blast loading, International Journal of Protective Structures, 4, 2, pp. 163-187, (2013); Codina, Ramón H., New sacrificial cladding system for the reduction of blast damage in reinforced concrete structures, International Journal of Protective Structures, 8, 2, pp. 221-236, (2017); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Mechanics and Materials in Design, (2017); Grima, Joseph N., On the potential of connected stars as auxetic systems, Molecular Simulation, 31, 13, pp. 925-935, (2005); Ha, Chan Soo, Chiral three-dimensional isotropic lattices with negative Poisson's ratio, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 253, 7, pp. 1243-1251, (2016); Habib, Fatah N., Cell geometry effect on in-plane energy absorption of periodic honeycomb structures, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 5-8, pp. 2369-2380, (2018); Habib, Fatah N., In-plane energy absorption evaluation of 3D printed polymeric honeycombs, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 12, 2, pp. 117-131, (2017); Hou, Yangqing, Graded conventional-auxetic Kirigami sandwich structures: Flatwise compression and edgewise loading, Composites Part B: Engineering, 59, pp. 33-42, (2014); Imbalzano, Gabriele, Blast resistance of auxetic and honeycomb sandwich panels: Comparisons and parametric designs, Composite Structures, 183, 1, pp. 242-261, (2018)",""

Blast-resistant doors are designed and constructed through combining three pultruded fluted-core sandwich panels framed by steel beams. With weight of 98.34 kg, the composite door is much lighter compared with traditional steel and concrete protective doors. Blast resistances of the composite protective doors are investigated by explosion testing. In current research, when the scaled distance is not smaller than 1.494 m/kg 1/3 , the door panel exhibits excellent anti-blast ability without any damage. When the scaled distance is less than 1.357 m/kg 1/3 , the structure damage is firstly characterized by the fluted-core shear and finally featured by the flexural failure of the delaminated sandwich panel. Including the deflection induced by the shear deformation of the fluted-core, dynamic one-way sandwich slab theory is proposed to predict the dynamic responses. The predictions are in agreement with the experimental results with acceptable errors. The dynamic theory can predict the critical scaled distance for the composite door based on core-shear failure criterion and the prediction is well consistent with the experiments. An equivalent static load model is suggested. Through the research, it is concluded that constructing protective door through pultruded GFRP fluted-core sandwich panels is a convenient, weight-saving and cost-saving way. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Failure analysis; Impact behavior; Mechanical testing; Sandwich structures","Blast resistance; Dynamic response; Explosion testing; Failure analysis; Fiber reinforced plastics; Forecasting; Honeycomb structures; Mechanical testing; Sandwich structures; Equivalent static loads; Flexural failure; Glass fiber reinforced polymer; Impact behavior; Light-weight constructions; Protective structures; Scaled distances; Structure damage; Failure (mechanical)","Analysis and Design of Structural Sandwich Panels, (1969); Satasivam, Sindu, Mechanical performance of two-way modular FRP sandwich slabs, Composite Structures, 184, pp. 904-916, (2018); Romanoff, Jani M., Bending response of web-core sandwich plates, Composite Structures, 81, 2, pp. 292-302, (2007); He, Li, Precise bending stress analysis of corrugated-core, honeycomb-core and X-core sandwich panels, Composite Structures, 94, 5, pp. 1656-1668, (2012); Briscoe, Casey R., Local shear buckling and bearing strength in web core sandwich panels: Model and experimental validation, Engineering Structures, 35, pp. 114-119, (2012); Huang, Wei, Dynamic response of circular composite laminates subjected to underwater impulsive loading, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 109, pp. 63-74, (2018); Liu, Jialin, Investigation on manufacturing and mechanical behavior of all-composite sandwich structure with Y-shaped cores, Composites Science and Technology, 159, pp. 87-102, (2018); Liu, Jiayi, The effect of temperature on the bending properties and failure mechanism of composite truss core sandwich structures, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 79, pp. 146-154, (2015); Hsieh, Mingwei, Investigation on the blast resistance of a stiffened door structure, Journal of Marine Science and Technology (Taiwan), 16, 2, pp. 149-157, (2008); Chen, Wensu, Numerical study of a new multi-arch double-layered blast-resistance door panel, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 16-28, (2012)",""

The ultimate load increased in proportion to the number of W-Connectors in both panel ends a third approximately.

This study aims to examine the performance of a new protective system utilizing auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels for mitigation of shock loads from close-in and contact detonations of high explosives. Both field blast tests and drop weight tests were performed using the proposed sandwiches as a shield for concrete panels in combination with conventional steel protective plates. The combined shield was found to be effective in protecting reinforced concrete structures against severe impact and close-in blast loadings. The honeycomb core with re-entrant hexagonal cells shows evident auxetic characteristics which contribute substantially to outstanding force mitigation and blast-resistance performances of such sandwich panels. Numerical simulations showed good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed auxetic panels were found to perform better than conventional honeycomb panels of the same size, areal density and material. Both were found to boost the energy absorption of the monolithic steel plate by a factor of 2.5 by changing its deformation pattern under close-in blast loading. In addition, a combination of the steel plate and an auxetic sandwich panel has aerial specific energy absorption (ASEA) higher than either of them, showing great potential for the development of lightweight blast protection of civil, mining, military, nuclear infrastructure and vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetic; Blast loading; Close-in detonation; Finite element; Impact; Negative Poisson's ratio; Sandwich","","Remennikov, Alex M., Experimental investigation and simplified modeling of response of steel plates subjected to close-in blast loading from spherical liquid explosive charges, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 101, pp. 78-89, (2017); Guruprasad, Siddalingappa, Layered sacrificial claddings under blast loading.

The deformation and failure modes of the different structures were analyzed and evaluated in detail. The honeycomb sandwich structures filled with reactive powder concrete prisms improved the capacity of ballistic resistance and energy absorption significantly, compared to the normal reactive powder concrete plates and sandwich structures without reactive powder concrete prisms. The analysis shows that the auxetic re-entrant cell honeycomb sandwich structures have a better ballistic performance than the hexagonal cell honeycomb sandwich structures. The sandwich structures were subjected to impact by three kinds of projectiles: flat, hemispherical and conical nosed. The ballistic limit of the flat nosed projectile is the highest, while the impact performance of the conical and hemispherical nosed projectiles is obviously different from the flat nosed projectile, especially in a relative high velocity range. The sharper nose leads to a higher value of exit velocity and mass loss. In addition, effects of different design parameters on ballistic resistance were also studied by changing the thickness of honeycomb cell and face plates. Results indicate that the thickness of honeycomb walls and face plates have significant effect on the ballistic resistance and energy absorption in a relative low velocity range, while there are no big differences when the initial impact velocity exceeds 400 m/s. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","ballistic resistance; energy absorption; honeycomb structures; reactive powder concrete; Sandwich structures","Ballistics; Cells; Concretes; Cytology; Energy absorption; Plates (structural components); Prisms; Projectiles; Sandwich structures; Velocity; Ballistic performance; Ballistic resistance; Deformation and failures; Different structure; Flat nosed projectile; Honeycomb sandwich structure; Impact performance; Reactive powder concrete; Honeycomb structures","Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1997); Lu, Guoxing, Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, pp. 1-403, (2003); Jing, Lin, The dynamic response of sandwich beams with open-cell metal foam cores, Composites Part B: Engineering, 42, 1, pp. 1-10, (2011); Jing, Lin, Response of metallic cylindrical sandwich shells subjected to projectile impact-Experimental investigations, Composite Structures, 107, 1, pp. 36-47, (2014); Wei, Zhensong, The resistance of metallic plates to localized impulse, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 56, 5, pp. 2074-2091, (2008); Dharmasena, Kumar P., Mechanical response of metallic honeycomb sandwich panel structures to high-intensity dynamic loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2008); Zhu, Feng, Deformation and failure of blast-loaded metallic sandwich panels-Experimental investigations, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 35, 8, pp. 937-951, (2008); Nurick, Gerald N., Behaviour of sandwich panels subjected to intense air blast - Part 1: Experiments, Composite Structures, 91, 4, pp. 433-441, (2009); Vaidya, Sushrut, Quasi-static response of sandwich steel beams with corrugated cores, Engineering Structures, 97, pp. 80-89, (2015); Cui, Xiaodong, Dynamic response of metallic lattice sandwich structures to impulsive loading, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 1-5, (2012)",""

Two SCS sandwich panels with different core depths were tested and the impulsive loading was applied in the laboratory by utilizing an inflated high pressure airbag to transfer the impact load from dropped projectile onto the panels. The deformation modes, applied pressures, displacement and strain responses of the panels were determined in the test. A combination of bending and shear deformation mode was observed in the SCS panel with thinner core while there was minimal visible deformation in the thicker panel. The maximum and permanent deformations of the panel with thicker panel were significantly reduced due to the increase in resistance and mass. Debonding between grout core and bottom plate was also noted in both panels during impact from the strain-time histories. Following the test, Finite Element (FE) models were constructed and verified against the test data to simulate the tests. It was shown in the FE analysis that the steel plates absorbed more energy due to its higher strength and ductility as compared to the grout core under the impact-induced impulsive pressure loading. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Failure mode; Impulsive loading; Numerical study; Steel-Concrete-Steel","Bending (deformation); Concretes; Failure modes; Grouting; Honeycomb structures; Mortar; Sandwich structures; Deformation modes; Experimental and numerical studies; Impulsive loading; Impulsive pressure; Numerical study; Permanent deformations; Steel concrete; Strength and ductilities; Finite element method","Richard Liew, J.

Proposed by Haldane over 20 years ago, it laid the foundation for the fields of topological order, unconventional quantum Hall effects, and topological insulators. Despite enormous impact over two decades, Haldane's original vision of a staggered magnetic field within a crystal lattice has been prohibitively difficult to realise. In fact, in the original paper Haldane stresses his idea is probably merely a toy model. I show that buckled lattices with only simple hopping terms, within in-plane magnetic fields, can realise these models, requiring no exotic interactions or experimental parameters. As a concrete example of this very broad, and remarkably simple principle, I consider silicene, a honeycomb lattice with out-of-plane sublattice anisotropy, in an in-plane magnetic field, and show that it is a Chern insulator, even at negligibly small magnetic fields, which is analogous to Haldane's original model.","","","Haldane, F.

Analysis of honeycomb material to reduce resulting accelerations is also presented where parameters such as honeycomb material modulus, wall thickness, cell geometry and structure depth are compared to the unprotected case. A simplified optimization analysis technique using a genetic algorithm is presented to demonstrate the use of this method to select a minimum honeycomb depth to achieve a desired acceleration level at a given level of input energy.

High fidelity finite element models for axially restrained SCS panels subjected to impact loading conditions were developed using LS-DYNA. The simulation results were validated against the dynamic testing experimental results. The numerical models were able to predict the initial flexural response of the panels followed by the tensile membrane resistance at large deformation. It was found that the strain rate effects of the materials and the concrete material model could have significant effect on the numerically predicted fl exural strength and tensile membrane resistance of the panels. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2012.","Impact resistance; Protective structures; Sandwich panels; Vehicle impact modelling","Concretes; Crashworthiness; Honeycomb structures; Impact resistance; Numerical models; Sandwich structures; Strain rate; Concrete material models; Flexural response; High speed vehicles; Protective structures; Sandwich panel; Strain rate effect; Tensile membrane; Vehicle impact modelling; Finite element method","Model Code for Concrete Structures, (1978); Evaluation of Ls Dyna Concrete Material Model 159, (2007); Ls Dyna Theory Manual, (2006); Ls Dyna Keyword User S Manual, (2010); Structural Impact, (1989); 21 Sup St Sup Australasian Conference on the Mechanic of Structures and Materials, (2010); Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computational Structures Technology, (2008); Richard Liew, J.

Cellular materials such as foams, honeycomb, and balsa wood used as core materials in sandwich structures are subjected to multiaxial loadings. Concentrated loads, impacts, and explosions can result in large deformations and damage, and yield or failure criteria are needed to predict the end of the elastic phase. Yielding or failure of isotropic foams is generally dependent on the hydrostatic stress, a feature that these materials share with many polymers, concrete, and soils. Appropriate criteria which are different from those traditionally used for metals have been classified in four major categories. Similarities between seemingly different criteria and between foams and other materials are brought out. Foams can also be anisotropic as honeycomb and balsa wood, and the anisotropy has to be accounted for in addition to the differences in strength in tension and compression in various directions. Suitable anisotropic criteria are shown to be the extensions of criteria previously used for isotropic materials and methods to present these criteria in a unified manner or to systematically extend isotropic criteria are discussed.

The experimental tests were performed by two different research agencies and comparisons of the blind interpretation and the actual design conditions of the posttensioned ducts and slab are included herein. Background of the impact echo technique and its implementation with a rolling scanning transducer are discussed in the paper. The impact echo technique is generally used to either determine the internal condition of concrete structures or to measure the thickness of concrete members. The rolling transducer in the impact echo scanner expedites the test process by allowing for rapid, near continuous testing. The results from the rolling impact echo scanning system are presented in a three dimensional fashion to provide better interpretation of the internal conditions of the ducts. In these studies, the impact echo results from both research agencies show good agreement in correctly identifying grouting discontinuities in tendon ducts. Discontinuities of grout in bridge ducts are located based on an indirect indication of a void due to an apparent impact echo increase in bridge wall/slab thickness that actually reflects the lower resonant echo frequency due to the decreased stiffness associated with the duct void. No direct reflection from the duct with grouting discontinuities was observed in these experiments.","Concrete; Grout; Honeycomb; Impact echo; Impact echo scanning; Nondestructive testing; Posttensioned bridge ducts; Void detection; Voids","Impact echo scanning; Posttensioned bridge ducts; Void detection; Voids; Acoustic transducers; Acoustic wave reflection; Concrete bridges; Concrete construction; Defects; Grouting; Honeycomb structures; Pneumatic equipment; Scanning; Stiffness; Ultrasonic imaging; Nondestructive examination","Standard Test Method for Measuring the P Wave Speed and the Thickness of Concrete Plates Using the Impact Echo Method, (2015); Proceedings of the 2nd CANMET ACI International Symposium, (1995); Impact Echo Nondestructive Evaluation of Concrete and Masonry, (1997); International Symposium on Non Destructive Testing in Civil Engineering NDT Ce, (2003)",""

Questions had developed regarding the extent and significance of areas that exhibited honeycomb or paste voiding near reinforcing steel on the underside of the roof shell following removal of acoustical ceiling tile. The objective of the nondestructive testing program was to identify locations of large, planar-type regions of deep voiding or delamination associated with the consolidation and reinforcement placement conditions. The combined use of Infrared Thermography and Impact Echo techniques allowed for effective scanning of the large roof shell structure entirely from the interior. Anomalous areas identified by the testing were verified by additional nondestructive testing, visual inspection, local exploratory openings and core samples. Based on results of the nondestructive testing, a broad-based repair program was implemented to correct conditions of near-surface voiding and through-thickness honeycomb. Repairs consisted of the application of structural shotcrete to restore integrity in thickened, key load transfer zones of the shell and the overall treatment of the entire underside of the shell with sprayed mortar.
