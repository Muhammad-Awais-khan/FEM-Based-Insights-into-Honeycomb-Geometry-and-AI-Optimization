The research addresses the lack of comprehensive studies on hexagonal geometries' thermal and hydraulic performance under varying flow and current conditions. This study's novelty lies in integrating experimental and machine learning methods to optimize heat transfer and friction characteristics, contributing to the efficient design of heat exchangers for industrial applications. An experimental setup with a turbulent flow regime and aluminum honeycomb heat exchangers was employed. The system parameters, including Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f), were analyzed for various honeycomb geometry rates (0.26, 0.56, and 0.80), airflow velocities (10, 15, and 20 m/s), and electrical currents (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 A). The data were processed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with a scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithm, achieving high accuracy in performance indicators such as MAE, MSE, ARD%, and R2. Experimental results showed significant improvements in Nu with increasing current and flow rate, while the impact on f was minimal. The highest thermo-hydraulic performance criteria (PEC) was observed for HGR = 0.80 at 20 m/s and 250 A, with a Nu increase of 36.46 % compared to the baseline. As a result, the findings demonstrate the potential of hexagonal honeycomb structures to enhance thermal performance while maintaining low-pressure drops, making them suitable for high-efficiency energy systems. © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS.","ANN; Forced heat convection; Hexagonal honeycomb; Machine learning; Turbulent flow","Air; Forced convection; Friction; Heat exchangers; Hydraulic machinery; Industrial research; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Transfer learning; 'current; Experimental learning; Forced heat convection; Hexagonal honeycomb; Learning-based approach; Machine-learning; Network-based; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Thermal and hydraulic performance; Honeycomb structures; Turbulent flow","undefined; Energy Production and Consumption, (2020); undefined; Vasanthanathan, Arunachalam, Biomimicry: An overview of structures, designs and materials inspired from nature, Current Materials Science, 13, 1, pp. 3-15, (2020); Zhang, Qiancheng, Bioinspired engineering of honeycomb structure - Using nature to inspire human innovation, Progress in Materials Science, 74, pp. 332-400, (2015); Lu, Tianjian, Heat transfer efficiency of metal honeycombs, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 42, 11, pp. 2031-2040, (1998); Liu, Shutian, New analytical model for heat transfer efficiency of metallic honeycomb structures, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 51, 25-26, pp. 6254-6258, (2008); Wen, Ting, Structural optimization of two-dimensional cellular metals cooled by forced convection, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 50, 13-14, pp. 2590-2604, (2007); Ozsipahi, Mustafa, Numerical investigation of hydraulic and thermal performance of a honeycomb heat sink, International Journal of Thermal Sciences, 134, pp. 500-506, (2018); Abou-Ziyan, Hosny Z.Z., Effect of gap thickness on a rectangular-cell compound-honeycomb solar collector, Solar Energy, 60, 5, pp. 271-280, (1997)"

In our previous work, gradient strategy was implemented in honeycomb structures (HCSs) for enhanced impact resistance, where optimal gradient profiles were determined through a neural network-based machine learning approach. Following the established methodology, this study extends the optimization to graded HCSs of different characteristic heights (defined as H/d, where H is HCS height and d is indenter tip diameter). It was found that for both hexagonal and re-entrant HCSs, the optimal gradient parameters are independent of characteristic height, whereas their energy absorption capacity exhibits linear scaling with height. Through numerical analysis and 3D printing-based experimental validation, this scaling behavior was attributed to the delocalized deformation mechanism, which causes the energy dissipation zone to expand proportionally with increasing structural height. Results presented in this work would provide critical insights for implementing functionally graded HCSs in various energy-absorbing applications, significantly advancing their practical engineering utility. © 2025","Delocalized deformation; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Machine learning","Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Honeycomb structures; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Structural design; Structural optimization; Deformation mechanism; Delocalized deformation; Energy; Graded honeycomb; Machine-learning; Network-based; Neural-networks; Performance; Property; Synthetic materials; Impact resistance","Yao, Haimin, Mechanics Underlying the Structure-Property Relations Unveiled From Natural Biomaterials, pp. V8-V8-302, (2023); Marshall, Grayson W., Mechanical properties of the dentinoenamel junction: AFM studies of nanohardness, elastic modulus, and fracture, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, 54, 1, pp. 87-95, (2001); Chen, Poyu, Predation versus protection: Fish teeth and scales evaluated by nanoindentation, Journal of Materials Research, 27, 1, pp. 100-112, (2012); Yao, Haimin, Protection mechanisms of the iron-plated armor of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent gastropod, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 3, pp. 987-992, (2010); Qian, Zhihui, Structure, mechanical properties and surface morphology of the snapping shrimp claw, Journal of Materials Science, 53, 15, pp. 10666-10678, (2018); Gao, Yang, Homogenizing interfacial shear stress via thickness gradient, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 131, pp. 112-124, (2019); Gao, Yang, Homogenizing interfacial shear stress in brick-and-mortar structured composites via gradient modulus for enhanced mechanical properties, Acta Mechanica Sinica/Lixue Xuebao, 40, 6, (2024); Wei, Yujie, Evading the strength-ductility trade-off dilemma in steel through gradient hierarchical nanotwins, Nature Communications, 5, (2014); Gradient Materials: An Overview of a Novel Concept, 88, 5, pp. 358-371; Cellular Solids Structure and Properties, (1988)"

However, designing high-performance metal-ceramic powders is challenging due to their complex composition, often requiring extensive experimental work. To address this problem, this study utilizes experimental data to predict the wear resistance of ceramic-reinforced, iron-based plasma fusion cladding layers through machine learning. The goal is to support the design of high-performance metal-ceramic powders. First, four nonlinear regression models were established. The optimal model was selected after optimization and comparison to predict the wear resistance of the cladding layer. Experiments were then conducted to validate the reliability of the prediction model. Finally, model interpretation, microstructural analysis of the cladding layer, and thermodynamic calculations were performed to elucidate the relationship between powder composition, microstructure, and performances of the cladding layer. The results show that the random forest model (RF) has the best prediction accuracy, achieving an coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.84 after optimization. This model effectively predicts the trends in wear resistance of the cladding layer. Based on the predicted results, a metal-ceramic powder was designed and used to prepare plasma cladding layers with excellent wear resistance. The interaction between powder compositions significantly influences the microstructure and, consequently, the wear resistance of the cladding layer. In particular, coupling effects, such as Cr<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf> & NbC and Fe60 & NbC, showed a stronger impact on wear resistance than individual compositions. The excellent wear resistance of the optimized cladding layer is attributed to a multi-scale strengthening mechanism. The micron-szied primary M<inf>7</inf>C<inf>3</inf> carbides are well bonded to the substrate. Their elongated shape and high hardness contribute to improved wear resistance. The matrix of the cladding layer consists of eutectic structure composed of micron-sized M<inf>23</inf>C<inf>6</inf> hard phase and submicron-sized ductile α-Fe phase. The honeycomb-like structure helps prevent excessive wear of α-Fe and the detachment of M<inf>23</inf>C<inf>6</inf> during abrasion, which is crucial for enhancing overall wear resistance. The nanoscale precipitates strengthen the α-Fe phase, further improving the wear resistance of the fused cladding. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Fusion cladding; Machine learning; Metal-ceramic powder; Microstructure; Wear resistance","Carbides; Ceramic coatings; Ceramic materials; Cladding (coating); Couplings; Decision trees; Forecasting; Honeycomb structures; Learning systems; Machine learning; Metal analysis; Powder metals; Random forests; Regression analysis; Reinforcement; Wear of materials; Ceramic powder; Cladding layer; Fusion cladding; Integrating machines; Machine-learning; Metal-ceramic powder; Optimisations; Performance; Powder composition; α-Fe; Wear resistance","Wang, Haoping, Performance improvement strategy of the TBM disc cutter ring material and evaluation of impact-sliding friction and wear performance, Wear, 526-527, (2023); Li, Jie, Material and processing optimization on disc cutter of tunnel boring machine for failure prevention, Engineering Failure Analysis, 138, (2022); Agrawal, Anil Kumar, A Novel Method of laser coating process on worn-out cutter rings of tunnel boring machine for eco-friendly reuse, Symmetry, 12, 3, (2020); Su, Banghe, Study on Wear-resistant Surfacing Flux Cored Wire for Shield Machine Hob, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1637, 1, (2020); Xu, Huanbin, The Effects of High-Energy Composite Surface Layer Modification on the Impact Performance of the H13 Steel Cutter Ring for Shield Tunneling Machine, Coatings, 13, 9, (2023); Hu, Dengwen, Microstructure and wear resistance of Ni-based tungsten carbide coating by laser cladding on tunnel boring machine cutter ring, Surface and Coatings Technology, 404, (2020); Hu, Dengwen, Microstructure and properties of in-situ synthesized Ni3Ta-TaC reinforced Ni-based coatings by laser cladding, Surface and Coatings Technology, 405, (2021); Wang, Haoping, Impact-sliding behavior of Ni-based coating prepared on tunnel boring machine disc cutter material produced using a plasma transferred arc welding process, Surface and Coatings Technology, 442, (2022); Wang, Kaiming, Microstructure and property of laser clad Fe-based composite layer containing Nb and B4C powders, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 802, pp. 373-384, (2019); Traxel, Kellen D., Selective laser melting of Ti6Al4V-B4C-BN in situ reactive composites, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 18, pp. 2654-2671, (2022)"

Body-centered-cubic, gyroid, and honeycomb lattice architectures are fabricated using laser powder bed fusion with A286 superalloy and subjected to split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) testing at impact pressures ranging from 2 to 6 bar. Experimental data are extracted for peak stress, max strain, max strain rate, and energy absorbed and structured into a multioutput supervised learning dataset. Four regression models (linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, and a fully connected neural network) are trained and compared. The neural network achieves the highest predictive performance with R2 values of 0.9859, 0.9884, 0.9673, and 0.9815 for PeakStress, MaxStrain, MaxStrainRate, and EnergyAbsorbed, respectively, and corresponding root mean squared errors of 7.58 MPa, 0.0121, 131.59 s−1, and 1.59 J. Shapley additive explanation-based interpretability analysis reveals that Pressure_Bar is the most influential predictor for MaxStrainRate, while Lattice_Type dominates the prediction of PeakStress and EnergyAbsorbed. Parity plots and error histograms confirm model fidelity, with the majority of predictions within ±5% of experimental values. The developed ML framework demonstrates strong generalization and offers a data-driven alternative to traditional SHPB experiments for performance evaluation of architected materials. This methodology provides a foundation for rapid surrogate modeling, material screening, and AI-assisted design optimization in high-strain-rate applications, with future potential for integration into physics-informed ML systems. © 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","additive manufacturing; energy absorption; high strain rate; lattice structures; machine learning; multioutput neural networks; split Hopkinson pressure bar","Additives; Bridge decks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Support vector regression; Energy; High-strain-rate; Lattice structures; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Multi-output; Multioutput neural network; Neural-networks; Rate response; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Energy absorption; Strain rate","J Mech Sci Technol, (2025); Siva Reddy, Bobbili Veera, Performance Evaluation of Metallic Honeycomb and Gyroid Micro-lattice Structures for Armoured Fighting Vehicles, Transactions of the Indian Institute of Metals, 77, 3, pp. 615-626, (2024); Shaik, Ameer Malik, Investigation of additive manufactured micro-lattice structures for defence applications, Materials Science-Poland, 41, 2, pp. 383-400, (2023); Song, Weidong, Dynamic mechanical behaviors and deformation mechanism of hybrid triply periodic minimal surface structures, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 203, (2025); Xiao, Lijun, Experimental study on the fracture behavior of 3D printed interpenetrating phase composites with triply periodic minimal surface architectures, Thin-Walled Structures, 208, (2025); Li, Xue, Compressive behavior of selective laser melting printed Gyroid structures under dynamic loading, Additive Manufacturing, 46, (2021); Saremian, Reza, Experimental and numerical investigation on lattice structures fabricated by selective laser melting process under quasi-static and dynamic loadings, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 112, 9-10, pp. 2815-2836, (2021); Cao, Xiaofei, Dynamic compressive behavior of a modified additively manufactured rhombic dodecahedron 316L stainless steel lattice structure, Thin-Walled Structures, 148, (2020); J Dyn Behav Mater, (2022); Prog Addit Manuf, (2024)"

This review systematically explores bio-inspired cellular structures as promising solutions for improving the impact resistance of EV battery packs. Inspired by natural geometries, these designs exhibit superior energy absorption, controlled deformation behavior, and high structural efficiency compared to conventional configurations. A comprehensive analysis of experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies published up to mid-2025 was conducted, with emphasis on design strategies, optimization techniques, and performance under diverse loading conditions. Findings show that auxetic, honeycomb, and hierarchical multi-cell architectures can markedly enhance specific energy absorption and deformation control, with improvements often exceeding 100% over traditional structures. Finite element analyses highlight their ability to achieve controlled deformation and efficient energy dissipation, while optimization strategies, including machine learning, genetic algorithms, and multi-objective approaches, enable effective trade-offs between energy absorption, weight reduction, and manufacturability. Persistent challenges remain in structural optimization, overreliance on numerical simulations with limited experimental validation, and narrow focus on a few bio-inspired geometries and thermo-electro-mechanical coupling, for which engineering solutions are proposed. The review concludes with future research directions focused on geometric optimization, multi-physics modeling, and industrial integration strategies. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for advancing next-generation crashworthy battery pack designs that integrate safety, performance, and sustainability in electric mobility. © 2025 by the authors.","bio-inspired designs; crashworthiness; energy absorption; finite element analysis","","Mawuntu, Nadya Novarizka, Modeling of the Battery Pack and Battery Management System towards an Integrated Electric Vehicle Application, Energies, 16, 20, (2023); Capasso, Clemente, Design approach for electric vehicle battery packs based on experimentally tested multi-domain models, Journal of Energy Storage, 77, (2024); Li, Ruoxu, Bio-inspired honeycomb structures to improve the crashworthiness of a battery-pack system, Engineering Failure Analysis, 158, (2024); Agarwal, A., Crashworthiness Evaluation of Electric Vehicle Battery Packs Using Honeycomb Structures and Explicit Dynamic Analysis, E3S Web of Conferences, 519, (2024); Dua, Sahib, Potential of natural fiber based polymeric composites for cleaner automotive component production -a comprehensive review, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 25, pp. 1086-1104, (2023); Brătucu, Gabriel, Acquisition of electric vehicles-A step towards green consumption.

However, their anisotropy and complex geometry lead to intricate impact signals, making localization highly challenging. In this paper, a two-step impact localization method based on time series features (TSF) and machine learning is proposed. The first stage of this methodology transforms impact response sequences from different zones into a spectrum of TSF sets, including recursive quantized features (RQF), recursive plot features (RPF) and gridded representation features (GPF). This is achieved using a time series image-based representation approach. Subsequently, three distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are constructed, namely RQF-1DCNN, RPF-2DCNN and GPF-2DCNN. These networks are employed to mine and learn deep-level features of time-series data, thereby transforming the impact localization task into a time-series feature classification task, specifically impact zone identification. The second step aims to precisely identify the impact location within the zone by utilizing impact response data and geometric center-of-mass algorithms at known locations within the identified impact zone. The proposed method is validated through low-velocity impact tests on composite honeycomb panels and aircraft wing structures. Additionally, differences in impact localization accuracy among various network models are analyzed. This method offers a cost-effective solution, achieving high accuracy with fewer sensors and less training data. Test results demonstrate that the RPF-2DCNN and GPF-2DCNN models, which are based on image features, outperform the RQF-1DCNN for impact monitoring in composite structures, achieving reliable impact localization with data from a single sensor. Moreover, compared to GPF, RPF, with its deeper time response sequence, is more appropriate for impact monitoring on wing structures with complex structural characteristics. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Composite; Convolutional neural network; Impact localization; Time series images","Composites structures; Convolutional neural network; Feature learning; Impact localization; Localisation; Localization method; Plot features; Time series features; Time series image; Times series","Yu, Zexing, Impact localization and force reconstruction for composite plates based on virtual time reversal processing with time-domain spectral finite element method, Structural Health Monitoring, 22, 6, pp. 4149-4170, (2023); Zhao, Chen, Localization of surface dent deformation and inter-laminated damage in CFRP laminates under low-velocity impact behavior based on multi-channel one-dimensional convolutional gated recurrent unit, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 221, (2023); Qiu, Lei, A Lightweight System with Ultralow-Power Consumption for Online Continuous Impact Monitoring of Aerospace Vehicle Structures, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 68, 6, pp. 5281-5292, (2021); Ren, Yuanqiang, A diagnostic imaging approach for online characterization of multi-impact in aircraft composite structures based on a scanning spatial-wavenumber filter of guided wave, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 90, pp. 44-63, (2017); Yuan, Shenfang, A Multi-Response-Based Wireless Impact Monitoring Network for Aircraft Composite Structures, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 63, 12, pp. 7712-7722, (2016); Fu, Tao, Impact source identification in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate by using embedded fiber optic acoustic emission sensors, Composites Part B: Engineering, 66, pp. 420-429, (2014); Jang, Byeong-wook, Impact localization of composite stiffened panel with triangulation method using normalized magnitudes of fiber optic sensor signals, Composite Structures, 211, pp. 522-529, (2019); El-Bakari, Abdelali, Assessing impact force localization by using a particle swarm optimization algorithm, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 333, 6, pp. 1554-1561, (2014); Theodosiou, T.

Based on the deconstruction of honeycomb structures, a modular hierarchical honeycomb protection system (MHHS) is developed in this study, offering easy assembly and transportation. The protective performance and deformation behaviors of the modular system are evaluated through drop weight impact tests at 20 J and 60 J, verifying the validity of the finite element simulations. Compared to the integrated honeycomb structure, the modular system reduces peak force by 50% on average while enhancing dynamic specific energy absorption by 54.7% (20 J) and 217% (60 J). The collision durations of the modular system are approximately 2.8 times and 5.5 times longer, indicating less structural stiffness and more structural elasticity. The self-locking effect of the modular system emerges from interactions between the bolts’ bidirectional three-point bending deformation and transverse compressive deformation of components, promoting tighter deformation coupling. Two structural failure criteria are established based on the multi-peak and multi-wave characteristics of response curves, enabling effective dataset preprocessing.

However, the design of elastomer lattice materials can be challenging when the manufacturing process induces geometric deformations that can significantly affect the material properties. This paper presents a method for fast, image-based measurements of geometric deformations in additively manufactured elastomeric honeycombs and the impact of these deformations on mechanical properties. A total of 55 parts were designed, fabricated, and tested; these parts have linear elastic stiffness 15.4–1422.8 kPa and plateau stress 1.4–164.3 kPa. Image measurements extract the length and thickness dimensions of every wall in every part, revealing small but random distortions that arise from the manufacturing process. An additional 10 parts were modified to have larger deformations for the purpose of the study. Machine learning models trained using the measured wall dimensions accurately predict the mechanical properties. Models that use measured wall dimensions outperform models based on design values only. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) predicts the linear elastic stiffness, plateau stress, and densification onset with 18.2 %, 16.0 %, and 3.2 % error.

This study aims to explore the potential of Lablab purpureus fibers (LPFs) as sustainable materials by employing advanced characterization techniques and machine learning-driven analysis. Chemical analysis identified LPFs' primary composition as cellulose (72.34 %), hemicellulose (11.46 %), and lignin (8.99 %), with minor components including wax (3.45 %) and ash (2.59 %). The average fiber diameter was measured at 237.95 μm, with a density of 1.24 g/cm3, making LPFs lightweight yet robust. Mechanical testing across varying relative humidity (RH) levels revealed a decrease in tensile properties, with fracture stress declining from 420 MPa at 24 % RH to 350 MPa at 81 % RH. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated a crystallinity index (CI) of 74.62 % and a crystalline size of 8.73 nm, indicating high structural integrity. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), provided insights into the chemical bonds within the fibers, confirming the presence of cellulose I and cellulose II polymorphs. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) highlighted thermal degradation stages, with hemicellulose decomposition at 220–315 °C, cellulose decomposition at 315–400 °C, and lignin degradation above 400 °C, showcasing thermal stability up to 320 °C. Hydrothermal absorption behavior, analyzed through K-means clustering, revealed distinct absorption patterns, with a maximum moisture uptake of 12.3 % at 81 % RH. Biodegradability tests indicated increased decomposition with higher RH, peaking at 81 % RH with a weight loss of 68.57 % over 16 days. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed intricate fiber morphology, including layered transitions, internal voids, and a honeycomb-like surface structure. Compared to other natural fibers such as Cissus quadrangularis (CI: 82.73 %) and lavender (CI: 65 %), LPFs exhibit a balanced combination of mechanical strength, thermal stability, and biodegradability, making them promising candidates for biocomposites and eco-friendly materials. These findings, supported by machine learning-driven insights, position LPFs as a sustainable alternative to synthetic fibers in industrial applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Biodegradability analysis; K-means clustering; Lablab purpureus fibers; Machine learning techniques; Principal component analysis","Bond strength (chemical); Cellulose; Compressive strength; Crack tips; Fourier transforms; Fracture mechanics; Fracture testing; Fracture toughness; Honeycomb structures; Impact strength; Isomers; Lignin; Metamorphic rocks; Nanocrystalline alloys; Natural fibers; Pyrolysis; Synthetic textile fibers; Tensile testing; Thermogravimetric analysis; Biodegradability analyze; Crystallinity index; Eco-friendly materials; K-means++ clustering; Lablab purpureu fiber; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Principal-component analysis; Thermal; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; polysaccharide; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradability; chemical analysis; chemical composition; decomposition; delignification; elasticity; humidity; hydrogen bond; hydrophilicity; k means clustering; Lablab purpureus; machine learning; moisture; physical chemistry; physiological stress; principal component analysis; scanning electron microscopy; tensile strength; thermogravimetry; thermostability; X ray diffraction; chemistry; cluster analysis; Compression Strength; Gravimetry; Honeycomb Structures; Impact Strength; Thermal Analysis; Cluster Analysis; Machine Learning; Polysaccharides; Principal Component Analysis; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Tensile Strength; X-Ray Diffraction","Zhou, Yang, An automated phenotyping method for Chinese Cymbidium seedlings based on 3D point cloud, Plant Methods, 20, 1, (2024); Wang, Junhua, Research Advances in Electrospun Nanofiber Membranes for Non-Invasive Medical Applications, Micromachines, 15, 10, (2024); Naeem, M., Lablab bean (Lablab purpureus L.)—An untapped resilient protein reservoir, pp. 391-411, (2023); Shubha, Kumari, A chemometric study comparing nutritional profiles and functional attributes of two botanical forms of Lablab Bean (Lablab purpureus (L.)

In this study, innovative B-spline honeycombs (BSHs) were developed to represent a variety of polyline/curve hexagonal honeycombs. The energy absorption performance of the BSHs was assessed using the finite element method, validated by quasi-static compression experiments. The developed data-driven optimization design framework integrates deep neural network models and genetic algorithms, enabling the generation of novel BSHs that fulfill specific design criteria. Using this framework, the upper specific energy absorption boundary of BSHs was determined to identify configurations with the highest specific energy absorption across varying relative densities. Additionally, empirical equations to compute the maximum initial peaking compression force, mean compression force, and specific energy absorption of BSHs at specific relative densities were summarized. These optimized BSHs were categorized into bowl-shaped BSHs, 30-sided BSHs, 5-shaped BSHs, 2-shaped BSHs, M-shaped BSHs, and r-shaped BSHs based on their topological structures. The BSH with the highest specific energy absorption, 13.4 J/g, belonged to the 5-shaped BSHs category, with a corresponding relative density of 9.15 %. The predominant deformation mode for these optimized BSHs, ensuring maximal material utilization, was identified as perfect folding mode. Compared to traditional hexagonal honeycomb and other polyline/curve hexagonal configurations at equivalent relative densities, the BSHs exhibited superior energy absorption capabilities. This study offers a systematic design approach for future endeavors aimed at developing high energy absorbing honeycombs with more intricate cross-sectional shapes. © 2025","Empirical equation; Energy absorption; Honeycomb; Machine learning; Optimization design","Deep neural networks; Honeycomb structures; Machine design; Sandwich structures; Splines; B splines; Data-driven optimization; Empirical equations; Energy; Energy absorption capability; Honeycomb; Machine-learning; Optimization design; Relative density; Specific energy absorption; Bulk Density","Shifa, Madni, Mechanical and electrical properties of hybrid honeycomb sandwich structure for spacecraft structural applications, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 23, 1, pp. 222-240, (2021); Ganilova, Olga A., Experimental investigation of the thermoelastic performance of an aerospace aluminium honeycomb composite panel, Composite Structures, 257, (2021); Goyal, Vinay K., Proof test methodology for reducing the risk of unvented honeycomb core failures in aerospace structures, Journal of Sandwich Structures and Materials, 25, 1, pp. 61-76, (2023); Hou, Wenbinw Bin, Study on mechanical properties of carbon fiber honeycomb curved sandwich structure and its application in engine hood, Composite Structures, 286, (2022); Upadhyaya, Shravan, Synthesis and characterization of honeycomb sandwiched composite material for automobile applications, Materials Today: Proceedings, 54, pp. 502-506, (2021); Amraei, Mohsen, Application of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panel as an energy absorber of high-speed train nose, Journal of Composite Materials, 48, 9, pp. 1027-1037, (2014); Garbatov, Yordan Y., Flexural response of additive-manufactured honeycomb sandwiches for marine structural applications, Ocean Engineering, 302, (2024); He, Yinchuan, Design and mechanical properties analysis of hexagonal perforated honeycomb metamaterial, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 270, (2024); Deng, Yun, Dual-Phase Inspired Soft Electronic Sensors with Programmable and Tunable Mechanical Properties, ACS Nano, 17, 7, pp. 6423-6434, (2023); Guo, Yanfeng, Shock absorbing characteristics and vibration transmissibility of honeycomb paperboard, Shock and Vibration, 11, 5-6, pp. 521-531, (2004)"

However, exhaustive search of the entire design space to optimize horizontal stiffness is time-consuming. Therefore, this research aims to develop a classifier to filter out less promising sections, reducing the search space and improving efficiency. Combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offers computational- and time-efficient solutions for classification tasks applicable to the design of hollow building components. However, the impact of different BNN configurations within this hybrid remains underexplored. To address this, we proposed and compared eight hybrid models with different BNNs to identify the optimal hybrid model based on classification accuracy. Results show that the BNN featuring a Bayesian layer followed by two linear layers (BLL) is most effective, achieving around 90 % classification accuracy in both training and testing datasets. To assess search space reduction, we test the models on 2000 samples. The hybrid model featuring BLL in its BNN achieves the best performance, with a 26.85 % search space reduction in the search space. Compared to a traditional statistical model, which achieves a 17.7 % search space reduction, the optimal hybrid model demonstrates superior effectiveness.

Algorithms based on machine learning (ML) models are capable of discerning intricate structural behavioral patterns from real-time data gathered by sensors, thereby offering solutions to engineering quandaries in structural mechanics and SHM. This study presents an innovative approach based on AI and a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) double-helix sensor system for the prediction of forces acting on steel tube members in offshore wind turbine support systems; this enables structural health monitoring of the support system. The steel tube as the transitional member and the FRP double helix-sensor system were initially modeled in three dimensions using ABAQUS finite element software. Subsequently, the data obtained from the finite element analysis (FEA) were inputted into a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model, with the objective of establishing a nonlinear mapping relationship between the inputs (strain) and the outputs (reaction force). In the FCNN model, the impact of the number of input variables on the model’s predictive performance is examined through cross-comparison of different combinations and positions of the six sets of input variables. And based on an evaluation of engineering costs and the number of strain sensors, a series of potential combinations of variables are identified for further optimization. Furthermore, the potential variable combinations were optimized using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, resulting in optimal input variable combinations that achieved the accuracy level of more input variable combinations with fewer sensors. This not only improves the prediction performance of the model but also effectively controls the engineering cost. The model performance was evaluated using several metrics, including R2, MSE, MAE, and SMAPE. The results demonstrated that the CNN model exhibited notable advantages in terms of fitting accuracy and computational efficiency when confronted with a limited data set. To provide further support for practical applications, an interactive graphical user interface (GUI)-based sensor-coupled mechanical prediction system for steel tubes was developed. This system enables engineers to predict the member forces of steel tubes in real time, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of SHM for offshore wind turbine support systems. © 2025 by the authors.","ABAQUS; AI; CNN; FCNN; FRP double-helix sensor system; GUI; member forces; offshore wind turbine support systems; SHM; steel tubes","ABAQUS; Aluminum bridges; Arches; Automatic testing; Carbon phenolic composites; Convolutional neural networks; Cost engineering; Electric towers; Embankments; Energy dissipators; Erosion; Error compensation; Error correction; Error detection; Foundations; Gamification; Honeycomb structures; Hydraulic structures; Instrument errors; ISO Standards; Light weight structures; Low temperature testing; Nondestructive examination; Offshore wind turbines; Pressure vessels; Quality function deployment; Retaining walls; Rigid structures; Safety factor; Temperature scales; Tubes (components); Tubular steel structures; Tubular turbines; Water towers; Convolutional neural network; Double helix; Fiber-reinforced polymer double-helix sensor system; Fiber-reinforced polymers; Fibre reinforced polymers; Fully connected neural network; Health monitoring; Member forces; Offshore wind turbine support system; Offshore winds; Sensor systems; Steel tube; Structural health; Support systems; Graphical user interfaces; polymer; steel; adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; benchmarking; cloud computing; computer interface; controlled study; convolutional neural network; finite element analysis; force; human; Internet; machine learning; mean squared error; mechanics; nerve cell network; prediction; sensor; software; tube; velocity; wind","Ren, Wei, Compressive behavior of stiffened steel tubes for wind turbine towers, Thin-Walled Structures, 183, (2023); Haselibozchaloee, Danial, A review of fatigue damage assessment in offshore wind turbine support structure, International Journal of Fatigue, 164, (2022); Varelis, George E., Structural behavior and design of high-strength steel welded tubular connections under extreme loading, Marine Structures, 71, (2020); Wang, Lin, Reliability of offshore wind turbine support structures: A state-of-the-art review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 161, (2022); Yang, Yang, An Overview on Structural Health Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Offshore Wind Turbine Support Structures, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 12, 3, (2024); Rohit, Trishwanth T., To design & simulate an off-shore wind turbine system and monitor its performance in real time, AIP Conference Proceedings, 3161, 1, (2024); Wang, Mengmeng, Recent progress on reliability analysis of offshore wind turbine support structures considering digital twin solutions, Ocean Engineering, 232, (2021); Glišić, Branko, Concise Historic Overview of Strain Sensors Used in the Monitoring of Civil Structures: The First One Hundred Years, Sensors, 22, 6, (2022); Gao, Ke, Review of Flexible Piezoresistive Strain Sensors in Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 19, (2022); Bado, Mattia Francesco, A review of recent distributed optical fiber sensors applications for civil engineering structural health monitoring, Sensors, 21, 5, pp. 1-83, (2021)"

However, its effect on mechanical properties – whether enhancing or degrading – remains poorly understood. To explore this, we generated 50,000 Voronoi network architectures with varying degrees of disorder and evaluated their mechanical response under uniaxial tensile stress using high-throughput finite-element simulations. Our analysis revealed two distinct failure mechanisms, with some disordered networks outperforming regular hexagonal honeycombs by up to 20% in strength and 100% in toughness, effectively overcoming the conventional strength-toughness trade-off. Remarkably, optimal architectures emerged across all disorder levels, challenging prior assumptions that such performance is achievable only with quasi-order. The mechanical impact of disorder is driven by local geometric features that determine whether the disorder has a positive or negative effect. By training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on this dataset, we accurately predicted mechanical properties, quickly identifying configurations that exceed traditional limits. This approach offers a pathway for designing lightweight, strong, and tough metamaterials by utilizing disorder to enhance mechanical performance. © 2024","Disorder; Machine learning; Mechanical properties; Progressive failure","Metamaterials; Plant diseases; Degree of disorder; Disorder; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Mechanical response; Progressive failure; Property; Trade off; Uniaxial tensile; Voronoi; Convolutional neural networks","Curtin, W.

The study analyzed two different setups: Type-I panels, which had banyan wood skin plates whose fibers are aligned in plane to the loading axis, and Type-II panels, which had skin plates whose fibers are aligned perpendicular to the loading axis. Both variants reliably aligned the aluminum honeycomb core with its cell axis parallel to the loading direction. An analysis was conducted on the behavior under quasi-static loading circumstances, and the capacities for absorbing energy were measured. The results showed that the energy absorption capabilities were improved during fibers along the cut (Type-I) situations in quasi-static circumstances.

Compared to conventional honeycomb or foam materials, auxetic configurations can reduce peak stress by 20%–40%, extend the stress plateau by up to 60%, and enhance densification resistance by over 30%, making them highly suitable for impact, blast, and crash energy mitigation. This review systematically summarizes recent developments in the design, optimization, and manufacturing of auxetic structures for energy absorption purpose. Among various unit-cell topologies, modified re-entrant offer high specific energy absorption under quasi-static loading, while rotating and hierarchical designs demonstrate superior performance in multi-directional and dynamic scenarios. Optimization strategies, ranging from topology optimization to surrogate-assisted machine learning, enable precise tailoring of energy absorption profiles. Additionally, advances in additive manufacturing and modular assembly facilitate the scalable fabrication of complex auxetic geometries.

Experimental investigations were conducted at different impact energies (10, 20, 30, and 40 J) to evaluate peak force and absorbed energy. The results indicated that nano-clay reinforcement significantly improves impact resistance, with the 4% nano-clay panel showing a 43% reduction in damage area compared to the unreinforced panel at 10 J. Machine learning (ML) models including Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, and others were used to predict force and energy absorption.

The hybrid HCS, composed of re-entrant (RE) and elliptical annular re-entrant (EARE) honeycomb cells, was created by constructing arrangement matrices to achieve structural lightweight. The machine learning (ML) framework consisted of a neural network (NN) forward regression model for predicting impact resistance and a multi-objective optimization algorithm for generating high-performance designs. The surrogate of the local design space was initially realized by establishing the NN in the small sample dataset, and the active learning strategy was used to continuously extended the local optimal design until the model converged in the global space. The results indicated that the active learning strategy significantly improved the inference capability of the NN model in unknown design domains. By guiding the iteration direction of the optimization algorithm, lightweight designs with high impact resistance were identified. The energy absorption capacity of the optimal design reached 94.98% of the EARE honeycomb, while the initial peak stress and mass decreased by 28.85% and 19.91%, respectively. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for global explanation of the NN indicated a strong correlation between the arrangement mode of HCS and its impact resistance. By reducing the stiffness of the cells at the top boundary of the structure, the initial impact damage sustained by the structure can be significantly improved. Overall, this study proposed a general lightweight design method for array structures under impact loads, which is beneficial for the widespread application of honeycomb-based protective structures. © 2025 China Ordnance Society","Hybrid structures; Impact resistance; Inverse design; Lightweight; Re-entrant honeycomb","Inverse problems; Model structures; Structural analysis; Active learning strategies; Design frameworks; Ellipticals; High impact resistance; Hybrid structure; Inverse designs; Lightweight; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Re-entrant honeycomb; Honeycomb structures","Hu, Qianran, The personal protective equipment (PPE) based on individual combat: A systematic review and trend analysis, Defence Technology, 28, pp. 195-221, (2023); Xia, Ping, Achieving high strength and energy absorption of novel 3D printed helical layered square honeycombs, Thin-Walled Structures, 203, (2024); Li, Jiachen, Experimental crushing behavior and energy absorption of angular gradient honeycomb structures under quasi-static and dynamic compression, Defence Technology, 36, pp. 47-63, (2024); Zhang, Yong, Load characteristics of triangular honeycomb structures with self-similar hierarchical features, Engineering Structures, 257, (2022); Qi, Chang, Dynamic crushing response of novel re-entrant circular auxetic honeycombs: Numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, Aerospace Science and Technology, 124, (2022); Zhang, Jianjun, Energy absorption of re-entrant honeycombs in tension and compression, Engineering Structures, 288, (2023); Def Technol, (2024); Esmaeili, Afshin, A new design of star auxetic metastructure with enhanced energy-absorption under various loading rates: Experimental and numerical study, Structures, 63, (2024); Jiang, Hongyong, Crashworthiness of novel concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio biologically inspired by coconut palm, Thin-Walled Structures, 154, (2020); Hao, Jian, Novel dual-platform lightweight metamaterials with auxeticity, Engineering Structures, 270, (2022)"

They are adapting to evolving consumer preferences for vehicle features and performance. Fused filament fabrication is one of the additive manufacturing techniques that will novelly address these issues with rapid prototyping, custom part production, intricate designs, lightweight yet strong components, and reducing assembly time for complex functional parts. This study aims to examine the influence of process parameters, specifically nozzle diameter (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mm) and internal filling pattern (triangular, honeycomb, rectilinear), on the structural behaviour, namely impact, compression, and flexural behaviour, of different polymer composites through fused filament fabrication.

The SFHS panels have shown better load-bearing capacity and performance characteristics compared to FHS panel after Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) tests. After the LVI test, MATLAB image processing was used to analyze the impact damage areas and failure mechanisms. In addition, Machine Learning regression algorithms were employed to predict the optimal amount of energy absorbed during low-velocity impact testing of fabricated panels with a maximum impactor drop height of 700 mm. The results indicated that nylon yarn stitching significantly improved energy absorption and interfacial behavior compared to unstitched honeycomb panels. This research also revealed that SFHS1 panels with adjacent honeycomb cell stitching are more impact resistant, provide increased load carrying capacity, and are cost-effective.

Highlights: Stitched Foam Filled Honeycomb Sandwich (SFHS) panels, manufactured via resin transfer molding, and eliminates weak interfaces between the face sheets and core. SFHS panels outperformed unstitched panels in load-bearing and energy absorption during low-velocity impact, as confirmed by MATLAB image analysis showing reduced damage and failure.

Through advance feature importance analysis and correlation heatmaps, key determinants of mechanical behaviour such as lattice volume, surface roughness, micro-Vickers hardness, and lattice dimensions are identified. The findings reveal that lattice volume and surface roughness are the most significant predictors of displacement, accounting for 24.29 % and 23.71 % of the predictive power, respectively. An inverse relationship between micro-Vickers hardness and displacement emphasizes the need for material hardness optimization in design processes. Scatterplot analyses show complex interactions between surface roughness and micro-Vickers hardness across different conditions. Gyroid and BCC lattices exhibit inverse linear trends, while honeycomb and diamond display distinct linear and horizontal patterns, respectively. These complexities necessitate advanced analytical techniques like machine learning to capture and predict the mechanical behaviours of lattice structures effectively. Machine learning's ability to handle high-dimensional data and identify non-linear relationships is crucial for accurate predictive models.

By establishing the relationship between the height of the cell and the cell-wall angle, HCS with different gradient modes were designed. The developed machine learning (ML) framework consisted of a forward regression model based on neural network (NN) and an inverse optimization model based on generative adversarial network (GAN). The regression model surrogated finite element analysis (FEA) to rapidly provide corresponding mechanical properties for the generated data of GAN. To ensure that the generated data met the desired design targets, additional physical constraints were incorporated into the generator of the GAN. This ensured that the network output not only consisted of valid data but also exhibited superior impact resistance. The results demonstrated that the trained ML model optimized both specific energy absorption (SEA) and initial peak stress of HCS. It even discovered high-performance gradient designs that outperformed the original data, with a maximum energy absorption 49.5% higher than that of uniform HCS. Moreover, the gradient modes and structural parameters of superior designs were identified, which is of great significance for the gradient design of HCS under impact loading. As a general design approach, this ML framework holds significant potential for the optimization design of metamaterials in other structures or with different mechanical properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Generative adversarial networks; Graded honeycomb; Impact resistance; Inverse design; Machine learning","Biomechanics; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Regression analysis; Cell walls; Design frameworks; Graded honeycomb; High impact resistance; Impact loadings; Inverse designs; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Regression modelling; Generative adversarial networks; artificial neural network; design; finite element method; loading; machine learning; optimization; regression analysis; structural analysis","Li, Lingbo, A novel hybrid auxetic honeycomb with enhanced load-bearing and energy absorption properties, Engineering Structures, 289, (2023); Charekhli-Inanllo, Mojtaba, The effect of various shape core materials by FDM on low velocity impact behavior of a sandwich composite plate, Engineering Structures, 294, (2023); Gao, Yang, Graded honeycombs with high impact resistance through machine learning-based optimization, Thin-Walled Structures, 188, (2023); Wang, Menghuan, Machine learning accelerated design of auxetic structures, Materials and Design, 234, (2023); Zhu, Yazhi, Cyclic behavior of ellipse and peanut-shaped perforated buckling-restrained braces, Engineering Structures, 291, (2023); Li, Jinghui, Deep learning-enhanced design for functionally graded auxetic lattices, Engineering Structures, 292, (2023); Jiang, Weizhong, An improved re-entrant honeycomb with programmable densification and multistage energy-absorbing performance, Engineering Structures, 301, (2024); Zhu, Yilin, In-plane elastic properties of a novel re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with zigzag inclined ligaments, Engineering Structures, 268, (2022); Zhu, Difeng, A novel elliptical annular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb with enhanced stiffness, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 262, (2024); Zhang, Xiaolong, In-plane elasticity of a novel vertical strut combined re-entrant honeycomb structure with negative Poisson's ratio, Thin-Walled Structures, 163, (2021)"

Innovative assistive technologies are crucial in addressing this daunting challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the mechanical properties, efficacy, safety, and user experience of the Intelligent Bone Protection Vest (IBPV), a novel, reusable, non-airbag wearable device. Research Design and Methods: The IBPV integrates a machine learning-based algorithm for real-time monitoring of wearer motion and a unique honeycomb-structured foldable cushion for fall impact attenuation. We evaluated the impact attenuation capabilities of the IBPV and conducted 2 human subject studies to assess its efficacy and safety. Additionally, semistructured interviews were conducted to qualitatively explore its usability, safety, and opportunities for enhancement. Results: The compression tests confirmed the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb-structured foldable cushion. In over 800 fall tests involving 14 young and middle-aged subjects using a touchdown fall test, as well as 7 older subjects using a novel fall simulation test, the IBPV demonstrated an overall protection rate exceeding 84%. Discussion and Implications: These results underscored the potential of the IBPV in reducing fall-induced injuries by mitigating the impact force on the hip during falls.

To systematically investigate the impacts of the application of artificial intelligence in the workforce on household energy consumption in China, empirical analysis is conducted using data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS) from May to September 2022. The findings are as follows: (1) AI significantly reduces household energy consumption. Controlling other factors constant, for a one-standard-deviation increase in the impact of AI, household energy consumption drops by an average of 10.751%. Robustness and endogeneity tests, including dealing with missing values, using different energy consumption and AI indicators, as well as applying instrumental variable method, placebo test and penalized regressions, confirm this conclusion. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that AI reduces energy consumption by lowering household income and increasing their financial fragility. (3) AI's impacts on different types of energy consumption are heterogeneous. Its negative effects are mainly observed in the significant reduction of electricity and gas consumption. Furthermore, it increases the probability of using solid fuels such as honeycomb coal, coal lumps, traditional biomass, etc., thereby increasing the reliance on low-grade energy resources and raising the risk of energy poverty. (4) AI has greater negative effects on those who do not have access to energy subsidies and households with poor energy security and stability, lower income and inadequate social security. Besides, its impacts on regions with higher levels of technological development are more prominent. (5) Feasible pathways to mitigate the adverse effects of AI are explored. It is found that improving labor protection can help alleviate its adverse consequences on energy consumption. This paper provides evidence on the impacts of technological disruption from a demand-based perspective. It highlights the need for better policies on energy, social security, income distribution and labor protection to weaken AI's effects on household energy consumption and prevent them from falling into energy poverty. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Demand-based perspective; Digital disruption; Energy poverty; Financial fragility; Household energy consumption","Artificial intelligence; Coal; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Finance; Demand-based perspective; Digital disruption; Energy; Energy poverties; Energy-consumption; Financial fragility; Household energy consumption; Labor protection; Resources consumption; Social Security; Coal deposits; artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; energy policy; energy resource; household energy; income distribution; resource scarcity; risk assessment; social security; Sustainable Development Goal; technology adoption; China","undefined, (2021); Acemoglu, Daron, Automation and new tasks: How technology displaces and reinstates labor, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 33, 2, pp. 3-30, (2019); Acemoglu, Daron, Robots and jobs: Evidence from us labor markets, Journal of Political Economy, 128, 6, pp. 2188-2244, (2020); Acheampong, Alex O., Does energy accessibility improve human development?

Initially, Finite Structured Acoustic Element Analysis (FE) was employed to identify the natural frequencies arising from exposure to high noise levels in the sandwich panel. Subsequently, the outputs of the FE model (comprising 224 configurations) were used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model, using the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

Deep learning networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer have shown excellent performance on the task of medical image segmentation, however, the usual problem with medical images is the lack of large-scale, high-quality pixel-level annotations, which is a very time-consuming and laborious task, and its further leads to compromised the performance of medical image segmentation under limited annotation conditions. Approach. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised learning method, uncertainty-guided cross learning, which uses a limited number of annotated samples along with a large number of unlabeled images to train the network. Specifically, we use two networks with different learning paradigms, CNN and Transformer, for cross learning, and use the prediction of one of them as a pseudo label to supervise the other, so that they can learn from each other, fully extract the local and global features of the images, and combine explicit and implicit consistency regularization constraints with pseudo label methods. On the other hand, we use epistemic uncertainty as a guiding message to encourage the model to learn high-certainty pixel information in high-confidence regions, and minimize the impact of erroneous pseudo labels on the overall learning process to improve the performance of semi-supervised segmentation methods. Main results. We conducted honeycomb lung lesion segmentation experiments using a honeycomb lung CT image dataset, and designed several sets of comparison experiments and ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. The final experimental results show that the Dice coefficient of our proposed method reaches 88.49% on the test set, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in honeycomb lung lesion segmentation compared to other semi-supervised learning methods. Significance. Our proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of segmentation of honeycomb lung lesions, which provides an important reference for physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this paper, we studied the impact resistance of two types of broadly used honeycomb structures (HCSs), a hexagonal HCS and an auxetic HCS. We developed a neural network (NN) which could effectively help to find an optimal gradient design for energy absorption of HCSs in contrast with their uniform counterpart. The optimal density gradient for both hexagonal HCS and auxetic HCS was identified, which are 66% and 40% higher in energy absorption than their respective uniform control. Followed finite-element analysis revealed that density gradient of HCSs enables loading transfer among a greater deformation zone, consequentially more cells involving in energy absorption. The initially graded sample promotes a de-gradient process and leads to more homogeneous density; conversely, a uniform sample develops localized deformation when subject to impact loading. Such an equal-load-partition (ELP) strategy in graded HCSs is responsible for their supreme energy absorption.

This research explores that idea by studying the design and optimization of sandwich-based auxetic honeycomb structures to protect the pouch battery cells for the battery pack system of electric vehicles undergoing axial impact load using machine learning methods. The optimization was done using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Type II (NSGA-II) combined with Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

The current prevailing approach to assessing the impact resistance of these structures broadly hinges on mechanics-informed nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. However, this method is computationally expensive and ill-suited for tackling the implementation of automated condition monitoring schemes. To address these issues, first, this paper proposes a hybrid hierarchical auxetic structure named Hybrid-Hierarchical Re-entrant Honeycomb (HHRH) that is endowed with impact stress-reducing capabilities. Next, using explicit FE, the investigation uncovers the interplay between the key geometric features of this HHRH auxetic structure and the impact performance under low, intermediate, and high crushing velocities. The outcome of the nonlinear explicit FE simulations is then unified with random forests (RF) scheme towards the establishment of intelligent auxetic structural systems. The results revealed that the developed HHRH maintained the auxeticity of the regular re-entrant auxetic and exhibited superior performance in some crushing strain regions. Moreover, the HHRH structure manifests up to an 85 % reduction in peak stress and the proposed reinforcement boosts the auxetic property by up to 23 % when compared to the regular re-entrant auxetic structure under high-velocity applications. Regarding the established data-driven RF-enabled machine learning model, its predictive strength with optimally-tuned hyperparameters is demonstrated to excellently capture the nonlinear multi-modal crushing stress response at various crushing strains, velocities, and geometric variations.

However, the application of these techniques to stress-wave methods such as impact-echo and impulse-response data for local level detection has been limited. In this research, statistical pattern recognition in conjunction with the impulse-response test is shown to provide an efficient means for the detection of defects in concrete plates. For this purpose, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) derived from the impulse-response test following ASTM C1740 protocols at specific points on the test plate to define the feature space matrix. Analytical results demonstrate that the variability of the FRF increases in the presence of defects, which forms the physical basis for the proposed pattern recognition algorithm. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on the covariance of the feature space matrix to identify the dominant features of the FRFs and to determine the number of statistically significant factors or principal components. Factor scores are next used to identify locations on the plate that are associated most closely to each pattern. The generalized Extreme Value Studentized (ESD) test and box and whisker plots are applied to the factor score vector of all the test points to objectively identify test points with defects and rank these based on their severity. Two experimental specimens are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed detection algorithm. The first specimen, a partially reinforced clamped concrete plate, is used to demonstrate the relationship between the shapes and variability of the FRFs and the severity of defects (delaminations), the efficacy of the factor score as damage sensitive feature, and identification and the ranking of the severity of defects by using outlier statistical tests. The second specimen is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the procedure for detecting both void and honeycomb defects in a larger reinforced concrete plate on elastic supports. The proposed procedure is shown to provide similar levels of detectability as the highly refined yet time consuming ultrasonic shear-wave tomography test. While the impulse-response test has been in use for the condition assessment of concrete elements other than drilled shaft piles since 1980′s, defect detection has been based primarily on empirical observations and correlations with limited features of the frequency response function. The use of pattern recognition techniques to the full range of the frequency response function is proposed and shown to greatly improve the detection and characterization of defects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Frequency response function; Honeycomb; Impulse-response test; Outlier detection; Plate on elastic foundation; Principal component analysis","Anomaly detection; Covariance matrix; Damage detection; Defects; Frequency response; Honeycomb structures; Impulse response; Plates (structural components); Reinforced concrete; Shear flow; Statistical tests; Statistics; Structural health monitoring; Concrete plates; Defect detection; Factor scores; Feature space; Frequency response functions; Impulse-response test; Outlier Detection; Plates on elastic foundations; Principal-component analysis; Statistical pattern recognition; Principal component analysis","undefined; undefined, (2015); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2011); Zhu, Jinying, Imaging concrete structures using air-coupled impact-echo, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 133, 6, pp. 628-640, (2007); Ham, Suyun, Application of micro-electro-mechanical sensors contactless NDT of concrete structures, Sensors, 15, 4, pp. 9078-9096, (2015); de la Haza, Aldo O., Assessment of concrete structures using the Mira and Eyecon ultrasonic shear wave devices and the SAFT-C image reconstruction technique, Construction and Building Materials, 38, pp. 1276-1291, (2013); Martin, Julia, Ultrasonic tomography of grouted duct post-tensioned reinforced concrete bridge beams, NDT and E International, 34, 2, pp. 107-113, (2001); Sun, Hongbin, Nondestructive evaluation of concrete bridge decks with automated acoustic scanning system and ground penetrating radar, Sensors, 18, 6, (2018); Tarussov, Alexander, Condition assessment of concrete structures using a new analysis method: Ground-penetrating radar computer-assisted visual interpretation, Construction and Building Materials, 38, pp. 1246-1254, (2013)"

Although lightweight increases natural frequency, low stiffness of cellular structures reduces natural frequency. Designing structures with higher natural frequency can usually avoid resonance. In addition, because of the less amount of materials used in cellular structures, the energy absorption capability usually decreases such as under impact loading. Therefore, designing cellular structures with higher natural frequency and higher energy absorption capability is highly desired. In this study, machine learning and novel inverse design techniques enable to search a huge space of unexplored structural designs. In this study, machine learning regression and Generative Neural Networks (GANs) were used to form an inverse design framework. Optimal cellular unit cells that surpass the performance of biomimetic structures inspired from honeycomb, plant stems and trabecular bone in terms of natural frequency and impact resistance were discovered using machine learning. The discovered optimal cellular unit cells exhibited 30–100% higher natural frequency and 300% higher energy absorption than those of the biomimetic counterparts. The discovered optimal unit cells were validated through experimental and simulation comparisons. The machine learning framework in this study would help in designing load carrying engineering structures with increased natural frequency and enhanced energy absorption capability. © © 2021 Challapalli, Konlan, Patel and Li.","3D printing; cellular structures; energy absorption; Gans; inverse design; machine learning; natural frequency; optimization","3D printing; Biomimetics; Bone; Cells; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Cytology; Energy absorption; Machine learning; Structural design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cellular structure; Cellulars; Energy absorption capability; Gans; Inverse designs; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Unit cells; Natural frequencies","Academic Research Mechanical, (2025); Mannodi-Kanakkithodi, Arun Kumar, Machine Learning Strategy for Accelerated Design of Polymer Dielectrics, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Standard Test Method for Compressive Properties of Rigid Plastics; Mechanics of Composite Materials, (1997); Dassault Systemes, (2025); Challapalli, Adithya, 3D printable biomimetic rod with superior buckling resistance designed by machine learning, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Challapalli, Adithya, Machine learning assisted design of new lattice core for sandwich structures with superior load carrying capacity, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Challapalli, Adithya, Inverse machine learning framework for optimizing lightweight metamaterials, Materials and Design, 208, (2021); Chen, Huaicheng, An approach for predicting the compressive strength of cement-based materials exposed to sulfate attack, PLOS ONE, 13, 1, (2018); Cheng, Xiaoquan, Evaluation of tensile properties of a composite-metal joint with a novel metal insert design by experimental and numerical methods, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 30, 3, pp. 1004-1011, (2017)"

Mass and stiffness changes in a beam model are also shown to cause shifts in the internal force amplitudes and frequencies. After validating the experimental results for this simple beam, impact damage on the front side of a more complicated AI-AI sandwich honeycomb panel using active sensor measurements taken on the back side of the panel was identified. A lumped-parameter four degree of freedom model was used to estimate transverse forces within the panel due to damage in the form of dents and penetration based on measurements of the frequency response functions between excitation forces and acceleration responses. Load cells installed beneath the actuators were used to directly measure the input excitation instead of indirectly using the drive voltages as inputs to the damage identification algorithm. Spectral analysis of the baseline and damage measurements was then conducted to characterize and quantify impact damage. Increasing levels of impact damage were shown to result in increasing amplitudes of the internal forces due to damage. A change in stiffness, as opposed to a change in mass, was evident by downward frequency shifts in the internal forces. Damage to a transducer attachment was also identified by analyzing the load cell measurements for each actuator-sensor pair installed on the panel. Lastly, a concept for a self-healing sensor with attachment damage was presented. The method used feed-forward control of the actuator drive signal to correct the swept excitation force to provide a more repeatable input force to diagnose damage. © 2010 COMADEM International.","Damage detection; Piezo actuator; Self healing; Structural health monitoring","Acceleration response; Active Sensing; Active sensor; Analytical model; Beam components; Beam model; Damage identification algorithms; Damage measurement; Drive signal; Drive voltage; Excitation force; Four degree of freedom; Frequency response functions; Frequency shift; Honeycomb panels; Impact damages; Input forces; Internal forces; Load cells; Lumped-parameter; Mechanical force; Piezo actuator; Sandwich honeycomb panel; Self-healing; Spectral analysis; Structural component; Structural damage identification; Transverse force; Two-degree of freedom; Actuators; Algorithms; Frequency response; Honeycomb structures; Identification (control systems); Monitoring; Sensors; Spectrum analysis; Spectrum analyzers; Stiffness; Structural health monitoring; Vibration analysis; Damage detection","Tsuei, Y.
